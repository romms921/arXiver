         "Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",

         "We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona. We fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable values of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The models both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their treatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return different mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future reverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to constrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised via Bayesian priors.",

         "Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (< 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.",

         "The Impact of Bar-induced Non-Circular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves",
         "We study the impact of bar-induced non-circular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that non-circular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the position angle difference ($\\Delta \\phi$) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For $\\left|\\Delta \\phi\\right|\\lesssim40^\\circ$, non-circular motions produce a bar-induced \"dip\" feature (rise-drop-rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (${\\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA barred galaxies sample. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the \"dip\" feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low $\\left|\\Delta \\phi\\right|$ streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance $V_\\mathrm{los}$, while those in the bar tend to suppress $V_\\mathrm{los}$. We use a simple {\\misaell} model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$) and the discrepancy between ${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$ and ${\\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced \"dip\" feature in the RCs of barred galaxies combining both simulations and observations.",

         "A Study of Subsurface Convection Zones of Fast Rotating Massive Stars",
         "The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.",

         "Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.",

         "Fast Bayesian spectral analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks: Applications over GONG H$\\alpha$ solar data",
         "Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations.Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network.Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach.Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports.Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.",

         "The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\\,\\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \\gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\\sim 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.",

For the first time, we can determine the turbulence level (through the measurement of polarization degree) and the orientation (through polarization direction) of the magnetic field near the shocks, where particle acceleration occurs. IXPE reported so far the results of the observations of four SNRs: Cas A, Tycho, SN 1006 and RX J1713.7-3946. These objects exhibit a wide range of characteristics, including dynamical age, spectral composition of emission, and progenitor type. Aptly, they revealed significantly different results among them in terms of magnetic field properties and morphology, providing unexpected insights and shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanisms in astrophysical shocks.",

This year had a special context: both the CNRS-INSU and the CNES were preparing their scientific perspectives for the period 2025-2030 in the field of Astronomy-Astrophysics (AA). In this proceeding, we first describe the main actions undertaken by the Commission Transition Environnementale. Then, we summarize the discussions held during the half-day workshop, which brought together about 100 participants, and point to forthcoming proceeding, reports and other related resources. A key message is that the French A\\&amp;A community is now fully aware that astronomical activities simply cannot thrive indefinitely in the current situation, and seems now eager to seize the opportunity of developing our profession towards a better social and environmental impact.",

         "This paper presents an analysis of the predicted optical-to-X-ray spectral index ($\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$) within the context of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) associated with stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. We use the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate the evolution of binary systems and investigate the relationship between UV and X-ray emission during the ULX phase, namely the $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ relation. The study investigates the impact of metallicity on $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant anti-correlation between $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\\rm UV}$), consistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with metallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent slope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of ULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data, and the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with metallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower metallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant impact on the XLF and $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates, where the emission is focused into narrower cones. Furthermore, the study finds that UV emission in ULXs is predominantly disk-dominated, which is the likely origin of the $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ relation, with the percentage of disk-dominated ULXs increasing as metallicity rises.",

         "We present a study of the radio and optical properties of the high-frequency peaker (HFP) blazar PKS 1614+051 at $z=3.21$ based on the data covering the time period of 1997-2024. The radio data are represented by the almost instantaneous 1-22 GHz measurements from the SAO RAS RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the IAA RAS RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope of CrAO RAS. The optical measurements in the $R$ band were collected with the SAO RAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes and the ZTF archive data. We have found low overall variability indices (0.1-0.2) and a spectral peak around 4.6 GHz, which is stable during the long-term period of monitoring. An analysis of the radio light curves reveals significant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along with variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest frame, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts. Spectral modeling suggests the presence of both synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) processes. Based on the SSA model, we provide estimates of the magnetic field strength, which peaks at $\\sim\\!30$ mG. A spectroscopic study with the BTA SCORPIO-I spectrograph has found signs of the regular motion of a neutral hydrogen envelope around the blazar center, which confirms the presence of enough gaseous matter to form an external FFA screen. The results highlight the importance of multiwavelength and long-term monitoring to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability in high-redshift blazars.",

         "We have been developing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detectors with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure, named \"XRPIX\", for X-ray astronomy. In our previous study, we successfully optimized the design of the PDD structure, achieving both the suppression of large leakage current and satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Here, we report a detailed study on the X-ray spectroscopic performance of the XRPIX with the optimized PDD structure. The data were obtained at $-60^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ with the \"event-driven readout mode\", in which only a triggering pixel and its surroundings are read out. The energy resolutions in full width at half maximum at 6.4 keV are $178\\pm1$ eV and $291\\pm1$ eV for single-pixel and all-pixel event spectra, respectively. The all-pixel events include charge-sharing pixel events as well as the single-pixel events. These values are the best achieved in the history of our development. We argue that the gain non-linearity in the low energy side due to excessive charge injection to the charge-sensitive amplifier is a major factor to limit the current spectroscopic performance. Optimization of the amount of the charge injection is expected to lead to further improvement in the spectroscopic performance of XRPIX, especially for the all-pixel event spectrum.",

         "A Pilot Study for the CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Quasar Survey Based on Mock Data",
         "The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 $\\text{deg}^2$. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover a wavelength range from 2550 to 10000Å at a resolution of $R\\sim 200$ and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with the r-band magnitudes of $18<\\text{m}_{\\text{r}}<22$ using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code. Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying the strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate the black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts $z=0-5$ from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99\\%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90\\% of them could have precise redshift measurements with $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{NMAD}}=0.002$. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1-0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to AGN science and cosmology.",

         "We investigate the angular power spectrum ($C_\\ell)$ and angular correlation function ($w(\\theta)$) of galaxy number density field in the presence of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), explicitly accounting for the integral constraint in an all-sky survey. We show that the PNG signature in $C_{\\ell}$ is confined to low multipoles in the linear regime, whereas its signature in $w(\\theta)$ extends across a wide range of angular scales, including those below the nonlinear scale. Therefore, the equivalence between $C_\\ell$ and $w(\\theta)$ can be violated when scale cuts of multipoles or angular scales -- for example, to mitigate systematic effects -- are applied in the analysis. Assuming samples of photometric galaxies divided into multiple redshift bins in the range $0<z<7$, we forecast the precision of constraining the PNG parameter ($f_{\\rm NL}$) from the hypothetical measurements of $C_\\ell$ or $w(\\theta)$ assuming different scale cuts in the multipoles or angular scales, respectively. Our results imply that the PNG information can be extracted from $w(\\theta)$ on relatively small angular scales such as $\\lesssim 10$ degree for a high-redshift galaxy sample or from $w(\\theta)$ measured in a survey with partial area coverage.",

         "To study the formation of star clusters and their properties in a dwarf-dwarf merging galaxy, we have performed a numerical simulation of a dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger by using the Tree+GRAPE $N$-body/SPH code ASURA. In our simulation, 13 young star clusters are formed during the merger process. We show that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and without [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star cluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars contaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the energy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas. After that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new generation of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star clusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter and fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several hundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters take place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are tidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge at the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster. Therefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components in [Fe/H] abundance and age. We discuss our work in the context of observations and demonstrate the diagnostic power of high-resolution simulations in the context of star cluster formation.",

         "We present a theoretical model to investigate a two-planet pair that undergoes convergent type I migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk and traps into the first-order mean motion resonance. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and explores the subsequent dynamical stability of the system. We derive the analytical criteria for planets with an arbitrary mass ratio and validate through numerical N-body simulations. Slow migration and weak eccentricity damping are required for resonant capture, the latter of which has not received enough attention in the literature. Once capture into resonance, their following stability can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Notably, resonant capture remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. However, the subsequent evolution can be diverse when the mass of the inner planet is lower or comparable to that of the outer planet. Stability weakens as the relative strength between migration and eccentricity damping increases. The key results can be comprehensively demonstrated in a $\\tau_{a}$-$\\tau_{a}/\\tau_{\\rm e}$ plot, where $\\tau_{a}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm e}$ are orbital decay and eccentricity damping timescales, respectively.",

         "Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.",

         "Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.",

         "We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.",

         "With the evolution of radio astronomy, related education and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems in data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience. Our solution introduces a unique data acquisition approach, employing SCPI through Python to communicate with the setup's Data Acquisition System (DAS). The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications. The applications of this web tool are expandable and can be tailored according to the Observatory's Goals and Instrumentation as well as for the growing radio astronomy instrumentation and observing facilities coming up at various educational institutions.",

         "BlackTHUNDER -- A non-stellar Balmer break in a black hole-dominated little red dot at $z=7.04$",
         "Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\\lesssim z \\lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\\rm dyn}<4 \\times 10^8~M_{\\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{10}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.",

         "We report results on the internal dynamical evolution of old star clusters located in the outer regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Because the SMC has been imprinted with evidence of tidal interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we investigated at what extend such an interaction has produced extra tidal structures or excess of stars beyond the clusters' tidal radii. For that purpose, we used the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 data sets to build number density radial profiles of suitable star clusters, and derived their structural and internal dynamics parameters. The analysed stellar density profiles do not show any evidence of tidal effects caused by the LMC. On the contrary, the Jacobi volume of the selected SMC star clusters would seem underfilled, with a clear trend toward a smaller percentage of underfilled volume as their deprojected distance to the SMC centre increases. Moreover, the internal dynamical evolution of SMC star clusters would seem to be influenced by the SMC gravitational field, being star clusters located closer to the SMC centre in a more advanced evolutionary stage. We compared the internal dynamical evolution of SMC old star clusters with those of LMC and Milky Way globular clusters, and found that Milky Way globular clusters have dynamical evolutionary paths similar to LMC/SMC old star clusters located closer to their respective galaxy's centres. Finally, we speculate with the possibility that globular clusters belonging to Magellanic Clouds like-mass galaxies have lived a couple of times their median relaxation times.",

         "Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. We also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in the generated high-resolution snapshots, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos.",

         "Variability studies offer a compelling glimpse into black hole dynamics, and NICER's (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) remarkable temporal resolution propels us even further. NICER observations of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 10,000 Hz in a galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10 M_{\\odot}. No extra high-frequency break/bend or any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints on current models of X-ray emission and variability in AGN.",

         "New observations obtained with JWST of the proto-stellar HH~270 jet and the \"deflected\" HH 110 system, show that HH 110 has a morphology of a series of distorted working surfaces. These working surfaces appear to be \"deflected versions\" of the heads of the incident, HH 270 jet. We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give origin to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow. We find that we need a quite high sideways velocity for the streaming environment (of ~30km/s) in order to produce the complex structure observed in HH 110. This high velocity would be possible in an environment which has been strongly perturbed by the passage of other outflows.",

         "We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy 'Nube' was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.",

The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.",

         "It is unclear which fraction of cosmic rays above an energy of 1 PeV is accelerated by the observed Galactic PeVatron population. These sources' gamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray population. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458, associated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the diffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of thermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron emission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new constraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population of this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to spectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1, we compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal component. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which coincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that eROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios for the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we find no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence bound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1, which we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From this, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS J1646-458 of 7 uG.

         "Can supermassive stars form in protogalaxies due to internal Lyman-Werner feedback?",
         "Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.",

In early 2024, after 470,000 scans, the DASCH project finished. Now, this unique analog dataset can be integrated into 21st-century, digital analyses. The key DASCH data products include ~200 TB of plate images, ~16 TB of calibrated light curves, and a variety of supporting metadata and calibration outputs. Virtually every part of the sky is covered by thousands of DASCH images with a time baseline spanning more than 100 years; most stars brighter than B ~ 15 have hundreds or thousands of detections.

During almost 17 years of observations in orbit (from April 23, 2007, to January 18, 2024), AGILE contributed to high-energy astrophysics and terrestrial physics with many discoveries and detections. Two co-aligned X- and gamma-ray detectors, a silicon-strip-based tracker, a wide field of view gamma-ray imager and the fast-reaction ground segment were the AGILE innovative solutions with respect to the previous generation of gamma-ray satellites. With the AGILE's re-entry, the in-orbit operational phase ends, but a new phase of scientific work on the satellite legacy data archive opens: AGILE may still hold future surprises.",

         "First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.",

         "The G-ring arc of Saturn, confined by the 7:6 corotation eccentric resonance with Mimas, is primarily composed of micrometric particles. These particles, significantly influenced by the solar radiation pressure, are subject to rapid depletion. This study investigates a mechanism for dust replenishment in the arc, specifically analyzing collisions between macroscopic bodies and the satellite Aegaeon. Utilizing N-body and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we assess the dust generation from these impacts, with a focus on the most likely collision parameters derived from the N-body simulations. Our findings indicate that, while collisions among macroscopic bodies are inefficient for dust production, impacts involving Aegaeon are substantially more effective, providing conservative lower limits for dust generation. This mechanism, in conjunction with the natural decay processes and continuous dust generation from impacts, potentially keeps the arc population over thousands of years with a possible variation in brightness.",

         "Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.",

This may lead to horizontal flows in the photosphere. In addition, the suppression of such flows by magnetic field can alter the elemental transport processes. Aims. Using a simplified model of such a structured atmosphere and 2D MHD simulations of a typical He-rich star, we examine atmospheric flows in these chemically peculiar stars which often are strongly magnetic. Methods. We use Zeus-MP which is a Fortran 90 based publicly available parallel finite element modular code. Results. We find that for non-magnetic stars of spectral type BA, atmospheric flow related to horizontal temperature gradient can reach 1.0 km/s yielding mixing timescale of order of tens of days. For the magnetic counterparts, the flow speeds are an order of magnitude lower allowing for stratification of chemical elements. Conclusions. Magnetic field can influence the dynamics in atmospheres significantly. Strong horizontal magnetic field inhibits flow in the vertical direction, while strong vertical magnetic field can suppress horizontal atmospheric flow preventing elemental mixing.",

         "The current knowledge in cosmology deals with open problems whose solutions are still under investigation. The main issue is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the $4-6 \\sigma$ discrepancy between the local value of $H_0$ obtained with Cepheids+Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the cosmological one estimated from the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For the investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$ ranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$, and CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at intermediate redshift $z>3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern cosmology. The Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are particularly suitable for this task, given their observability up to $z=9.4$. The use of GRBs as standardizable candles requires the use of tight and reliable astrophysical correlations and the presence of gaps in the GRB time-domain data represents an obstacle in this sense. In this work, we propose to improve the precision of the lightcurve (LC) parameters through a reconstruction process performed with the functional forms of GRB LCs and the Gaussian Processes (GP). The filling of gaps in the GRB LCs through these processes shows an improvement up to $41.5\\%$ on the precision of the LC parameters fitting, which lead to a reduced scatter in the astrophysical correlations and, thus, in the estimation of cosmological parameters.",

         "The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.",

         "The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field directly at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of an electric field and better than 6\\% accuracy, with minimal bias, when estimating energy fluence. Additionally, this method is reliable for almost all arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.",

         "Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about the 3/2 ratio with Neptune's. We investigate the long term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, $g$, a well-known characteristic of Pluto's orbit. We show that the $g$ librators amongst the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity--inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincaré at the end of the 19th century. Approximately sixteen percent of the currently known Plutinos exhibit $g$ librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.",

         "We analyse the stellar distributions on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane for 11 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations. Alpha-element bimodality, in the form of two separate sequences on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane, is not a universal feature of disk galaxies. Five galaxies demonstrate double sequences with the $\\alpha$-enriched one being older and kinematically hotter, in qualitative agreement with the high-$\\alpha$ and low-$\\alpha$ populations in the Milky Way disk; three galaxies have unimodal distribution, two show weakly-bimodal features where low-$\\alpha$ sequence is visible only over a short range of metallicities, and one show strong bimodality with a different slope of high-$\\alpha$ population. We examine the galaxies' gas accretion history over the last 8 Gyr, when bimodal sequences emerge, and demonstrate that the presence of the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in the bimodal galaxies is related to the recent infall of metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium that joins the galaxy in the outskirts and induces significant growth of the gas disks compared to their non-bimodal counterparts. We also analyse the sources of the accreted gas and illustrate that both gas-rich mergers and smooth accretion of ambient gas can be the source of the accreted gas, and create slightly different bimodal patterns.",

         "The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.",

         "Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which manifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane which later dissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy I demonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the first one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the pattern speed of the bar so that the distortion remains stationary in the reference frame of the bar. The growth can be described simply with the mechanism of a driven harmonic oscillator which decreases the vertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase most bar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with resonant vertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes of vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal oscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the harmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal frequencies. In the following, second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of the distortion increases reaching one third of the circular frequency, but decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave and winds up leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased horizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of banana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar where the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly suggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose instability but can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical resonance creating the distortion that later winds up.",

         "Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079",
         "As the number of potential exomoon candidates grows, there is a heightened motivation of pursing orbital stability analyses. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation into 4-body systems, consisting of a star, planet, moon, and submoon by using the N-body simulator rebound. Particularly, we focus on the system of Kepler-1625, where evidence of a possible exomoon has been obtained. We investigate the 3-body star--planet--moon system for the proposed exomoon parameters allowing us to identify stable regions associated with most of the space parameters. Thereafter, we consider a 4-body system including a potential submoon. We find that there are both stable and unstable regions, as expected, as well as resonance patterns that are further explored using numerical and analytical methods including secular perturbation theory. We are able to identify these resonances as secular in nature. In addition, we investigate 3-body versions of two other systems, Kepler-1708 and HD 23079, while also studying a 4-body version of HD 23079. Our work may serve as a generalized framework for exploring other planet--moon cases in the future while noting that the current 4-body study may be an incentive for studying further exomoon and submoon systems.",

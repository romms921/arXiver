# Arxiver - 2025

**This repository is for educational purposes only, with the primary purpose of understanding academic research. We further our creative vision by exploring the minimum degrees of separation between a student and researchers who have achieved academic excellence.**

## Current Work

- The solution is currently a work in progress.
- `main.ipynb` retrieves and stores statistics of authors, topics, keywords and abstracts using the open-source arxiv api.
- `arxiv_module.ipynb` delves into retrieving  relevant articles for your area of study :)


## Future Work

- Develop a datastructure to identify and visualize interesting connections between authors and topics on a surface-level.
- Operating System Independent method to invoke the code to run on a daily basis for TLDR style reading with relevant keywords.

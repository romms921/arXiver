      "          Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies&#39; information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.\n",

      "          The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $&gt;$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.\n",

      "          The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.\n",

      "          The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude. Probabilities of collisions of bodies with Venus were about 0.1-0.3 at a velocity of ejection from Mercury between 4.3 and 10 km/s.\n",

      "          Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.\n",

      "          We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\\approx 500 {\\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \\approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \\approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \\pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \\pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \\pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.\n",

      "          Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.\n",

      "          The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.\n",

      "          Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.\n",

      "          Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.\n",

      "          We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.\n",

      "          We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfvén wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\\dot{M}=3.3\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénic <a href=\"http://waves.The\" rel=\"external noopener nofollow\" class=\"link-external link-http\">this http URL</a> nonideal MHD simulation for $\\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\\dot{M}=1.5\\times 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\\dot{M}=2.0\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}/$yr -- comparable to the observed value -- with transient magnetized hot bubbles.\n",

      "          Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.\n",

      "          Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \\sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \\sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\\%$ (at $90\\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \\sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \\sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.\n",

      "          We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\\rm e}=3.1380\\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\\rm H}\\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\\approx14\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\\lambda991.51$ (${\\rm log}\\,n_{\\rm c}=3.3\\,\\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\\sim1.5-6.0\\,Z\\rm\\,sun$, and is located at $\\sim15\\,\\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.\n",

      "          This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.\n",

      "          The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\\,\\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\,R_\\star$ and $f_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.\n",

      "          In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\\rm mag}&lt; 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)&gt;10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.\n",

      "          Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\\gtrsim 30\\degree$, at $b\\lesssim 30 \\degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.\n",

      "          We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.\n",

      "          Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $&lt;0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.\n",

      "          This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell&#39;s equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.\n",

      "          This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\\Lambda_m^{f(\\mathcal{R})}$ and $\\Lambda_m^{\\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.\n",

      "          Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter&#39;s de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.\n",

      "          We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.\n",

      "          We reexamine the nuclear structure properties of waiting point nuclei around A70 using the interacting boson model 1 (IBM 1) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) model. Effective density dependent meson exchange functional (DD ME2) and density dependent point coupling functional (DD PC1) were used for the RMF calculations. We calculated the energy levels, the geometric shapes, binding and separation energies of nucleons and quadrupole deformation parameters (\\b{eta}2). The shape coexistence phenomena in A 70 nuclei (68Se, 70Se, 70Br, 70Kr, 72Kr, 74Kr, 74Rb, and 74Sr) was later investigated. Spherical and deformed shapes of the selected waiting point nuclei were computed using the IBM 1 and RMF models, respectively. The proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model was used to calculate \\b{eta} decay properties (Gamow Teller strength distributions, \\b{eta} decay half lives, and branching ratios) of selected nuclei as a function of \\b{eta}2. The results revealed a significant variation in calculated half lives and Gamow Teller strength distributions as the shape parameter was changed. The \\b{eta}2 computed via DD ME2 functional resulted in half lives in best agreement with the measured data.\n",

      "          Magnetar is a neutron star with an ultrahigh magnetic field ($\\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G). The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 is not only one of the most active magnetars detected so far, but also the unique confirmed source of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is dedicated to monitor gamma-ray transients all over the sky, including magnetar short bursts. Here we report the GECAM observations of the burst activity of SGR J1935+2154 from January 2021 to December 2022, which results in a unique and valuable data set for this important magnetar. With a targeted search of GECAM data, 159 bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are detected by GECAM-B while 97 bursts by GECAM-C, including the X-ray burst associated with a bright radio burst. We find that both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow lognormal distributions. The period of burst activity is $134\\pm20$ days, thus the burst activity could be generally divided into four active episodes over these two years. Interestingly, the hardness ratio of X-ray bursts tends to be softer during these two years, especially during the active episode with radio bursts detected.\n",

      "          The UltraViolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-26 Treasury Program, allocated in total 164 orbits of primary Wide-Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and Visible light F275W imaging with coordinated parallel Advanced Camera for Surveys F435W imaging, on four of the five premier extragalactic survey fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. We introduce this survey by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the absolute escape fraction ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}$) of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation through stacking the UV images of a population of star-forming galaxies with secure redshifts at $2.4\\leq z\\leq3.0$. Our stacking benefits from the catalogs of high-quality spectroscopic redshifts compiled from archival ground-based data and HST slitless spectroscopy, carefully vetted by dedicated visual inspection efforts. We develop a robust stacking method to apply to 10 samples of in total 56 galaxies, and perform detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, to take into account the sample variance of the mean IGM transmission when measuring $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}$. The full stack at $z\\approx2.44$ from 28 galaxies places a stringent 1-$\\sigma$ upper limit of $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}\\lesssim5\\%$, whereas the full stack at $z\\approx2.72$ of equal number of galaxies gives an upper limit of $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}\\lesssim26\\%$ at 1-$\\sigma$ confidence level. These new F275W and F435W imaging mosaics from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).\n",

      "          This book chapter explores key aspects of neutron stars, pulsar glitches, tidal deformability, fast pulsars, the equation of state, and strange quark matter stars. Challenges in directly measuring neutron star radius have led to reliance on spectroscopic and timing techniques, with uncertainties addressed through careful source selection and theoretical modeling. Pulsar glitches reveal insights into the equation of state through angular momentum transfer within the neutron star. Tidal deformability is crucial in gravitational-wave astronomy, exemplified by the GW170817 event. Fast pulsars, instrumental in astrophysical testing, are classified into ordinary pulsars, millisecond pulsars, and magnetars. The EOS is vital for understanding neutron star internal structure, explored through various models. The chapter delves into the theoretical framework for rotating neutron stars, addressing uniform and differential rotation scenarios and their impacts on mass and radius. Additionally, the intriguing concept of quark stars and strange dwarfs is investigated. The various topics discussed in this book chapter contribute to a broader understanding of dense matter physics, astrophysical phenomena, and the potential for transformative discoveries through advanced observational techniques and technologies like gravitational wave detectors, radio telescopes, and X-ray telescopes.\n",

      "          The impact response of rubble-pile asteroids is essential for both elucidating their formation and evolution history and evaluating the efficacy of impact defense strategies. Although state-of-the-art numerical simulations have allowed for the replication of many macroscopic impact characteristics consistent with observations, the understanding of dynamics and response mechanisms within rubble-pile structures remains incomplete and requires further in-depth investigation. Such understanding is critical for assessing the effects and safety of impact defense missions. The loose structure of rubble-pile asteroids affects inhomogeneous internal stress propagation via inherent force chains, which may lead to structural fracturing. We demonstrate this phenomenon here, using a proof-of-principle two-dimensional model of granular aggregates. We find that the velocity response front to impact disturbances preferentially propagates along pre-existing force chains, with particles not in chains responding more slowly. The sites within the response zone where high dynamic stresses manifest are strongly correlated with these initial force chains, and the damages that result are predominantly located within areas enclosed by these chains. The strong correlation between pre-existing force chains and dynamic response is independent of the location, magnitude, direction of the disturbance velocity, or the aggregate&#39;s particle size distribution. All evidence suggests that the core reasons for this propagation preference lie in the structural heterogeneity of granular aggregates and the resulting differences in mechanical wave propagation. This investigation provides guidance for future research aimed at quantitatively assessing fragmentation risks based on the statistical properties of force chains.\n",

      "          Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients, with modern survey telescopes generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, Multi-Class Isolation Forests (\\texttt{MCIF}), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation and helps the neural network handle irregular sampling and model inter-passband relationships. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations matching the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method discovered $41\\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.\n",

In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.\n",

      "          We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds, which illustrates the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability at a characteristic mass scale determined by the microphysics of the gas. The approach is based on developing the &#34;one-zone&#34; density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities, we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, we show that our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.\n",

      "          Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\\tau/m \\sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.\n",

      "          The current accelerated expansion of the Universe remains ones of the most intriguing topics in modern cosmology, driving the search for innovative statistical techniques. Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly enhanced its application across various scientific fields, including physics, and particularly cosmology, where data analysis plays a crucial role in problem-solving. In this work, a non-parametric regression method with Gaussian processes is presented along with several applications to reconstruct some cosmological observables, such as the deceleration parameter and the dark energy equation of state, in order to contribute with some information that helps to clarify the behavior of the Universe. It was found that the results are consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM and the predicted value of the Hubble parameter at redshift zero is $H_{0}=68.798\\pm 6.340(1\\sigma) \\text{ km}\\text{ s}^{-1}\\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$.\n",

      "          The Cosmological Principle is a cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology and shapes how we view the Universe and our place within it. It is imperative, then, to devise multiple observational tests which can identify and quantify possible violations of this foundational principle. One possible method of probing large-scale anisotropies involves the use of weak gravitational lensing. We revisit this approach in order to analyse the imprint of late-time anisotropic expansion on cosmic shear. We show that the cross-correlation of shear $E$- and $B$-modes on large scales can be used to constrain the magnitude (and possibly direction) of anisotropic expansion. We estimate the signal to noise for multipoles $10\\lesssim \\ell\\lesssim 100$ that is achievable by a Euclid-like survey. Our findings suggest that such a survey could detect the $E$-$B$ signal for reasonable values of the late-time anisotropy parameter.\n",

      "          We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia&#39;s type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.\n",

      "          We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary region. Although our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.\n",

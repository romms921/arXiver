Previous studies have shown that models trained to predict behavioral\\nfeatures from the individual\\'s functional connectivity have modest to poor\\nperformance. In this study, we trained models that predict observable\\nindividual traits (phenotypes) and their corresponding singular value\\ndecomposition (SVD) representations - herein referred to as latent phenotypes\\nfrom resting state functional connectivity. For this task, we predicted\\nphenotypes in two large neuroimaging datasets: the Human Connectome Project\\n(HCP) and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). We illustrate the\\nimportance of regressing out confounds, which could significantly influence\\nphenotype prediction. Our findings reveal that both phenotypes and their\\ncorresponding latent phenotypes yield similar predictive performance.\\nInterestingly, only the first five latent phenotypes were reliably identified,\\nand using just these reliable phenotypes for predicting phenotypes yielded a\\nsimilar performance to using all latent phenotypes. This suggests that the\\npredictable information is present in the first latent phenotypes, allowing the\\nremainder to be filtered out without any harm in performance. This study sheds\\nlight on the intricate relationship between functional connectivity and the\\npredictability and reliability of phenotypic information, with potential\\nimplications for enhancing predictive modeling in the realm of neuroimaging\\nresearch.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jessica Dafflon</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Dustin Moraczewski</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Eric Earl</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Dylan M.

Ecosystem models\\nare often constructed by assuming stability and coexistence in ecological\\ncommunities as a proxy for abundance data when monitoring programs are not\\navailable. However, a growing body of literature suggests that these\\nassumptions are inappropriate for modelling conservation outcomes. In this\\nwork, we develop an alternative for dataless population modelling that instead\\nrelies on expert-elicited knowledge of species abundances. While time series\\nabundance data is often not available for ecosystems of interest, these systems\\nmay still be highly studied or observed in an informal capacity. In particular,\\nlimits on population sizes and their capacity to rapidly change during an\\nobservation period can be reasonably elicited for many species. We propose a\\nrobust framework for generating an ensemble of ecosystem models whose\\npopulation predictions match the expected population dynamics, as defined by\\nexperts. Our new Bayesian algorithm systematically removes model parameters\\nthat lead to unreasonable population predictions without incurring excessive\\ncomputational costs. Our results demonstrate that models constructed using\\nexpert-elicited information, rather than stability and coexistence assumptions,\\ncan dramatically impact population predictions, expected responses to\\nmanagement, conservation decision-making, and long-term ecosystem behaviour. In\\nthe absence of data, we argue that field observations and expert knowledge are\\npreferred for representing ecosystems observed in nature instead of theoretical\\nassumptions of coexistence and stability.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Sarah A.

Despite the increasing\\nadoption of artificial intelligence for novel AMP design, challenges pertaining\\nto conflicting attributes such as activity, hemolysis, and toxicity have\\nsignificantly impeded the progress of researchers. This paper introduces a\\nparadigm shift by considering multiple attributes in AMP design.\\n  Presented herein is a novel approach termed Hypervolume-driven\\nMulti-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Design (HMAMP), which prioritizes the\\nsimultaneous optimization of multiple attributes of AMPs. By synergizing\\nreinforcement learning and a gradient descent algorithm rooted in the\\nhypervolume maximization concept, HMAMP effectively expands exploration space\\nand mitigates the issue of pattern collapse. This method generates a wide array\\nof prospective AMP candidates that strike a balance among diverse attributes.\\nFurthermore, we pinpoint knee points along the Pareto front of these candidate\\nAMPs. Empirical results across five benchmark models substantiate that\\nHMAMP-designed AMPs exhibit competitive performance and heightened diversity. A\\ndetailed analysis of the helical structures and molecular dynamics simulations\\nfor ten potential candidate AMPs validates the superiority of HMAMP in the\\nrealm of multi-objective AMP design.

However, the lengthy scan times\\nrequired by conventional methods are inadequate for tracking contrast agent\\ntransport dynamically in mouse brain. We developed a 3D MR fingerprinting (MRF)\\nmethod for simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping across the whole mouse brain with\\n4.3-min temporal resolution. We designed a 3D MRF sequence with variable\\nacquisition segment lengths and magnetization preparations on a 9.4T\\npreclinical MRI scanner. Model-based reconstruction approaches were employed to\\nimprove the accuracy and speed of MRF acquisition. The method\\'s accuracy for T1\\nand T2 measurements was validated in vitro, while its repeatability of T1 and\\nT2 measurements was evaluated in vivo (n=3). The utility of the 3D MRF sequence\\nfor dynamic tracking of intracisternally infused Gd-DTPA in the whole mouse\\nbrain was demonstrated (n=5). Phantom studies confirmed accurate T1 and T2\\nmeasurements by 3D MRF with an undersampling factor up to 48. Dynamic\\ncontrast-enhanced (DCE) MRF scans achieved a spatial resolution of 192 x 192 x\\n500 um3 and a temporal resolution of 4.3 min, allowing for the analysis and\\ncomparison of dynamic changes in concentration and transport kinetics of\\nintracisternally infused Gd-DTPA across brain regions. The sequence also\\nenabled highly repeatable, high-resolution T1 and T2 mapping of the whole mouse\\nbrain (192 x 192 x 250 um3) in 30 min.

High-touch surfaces of\\nhealthcare centers, including textiles, provide a suitable environment for\\npathogenic bacteria to grow, necessitating incorporating effective\\nantibacterial agents into textiles. This paper introduces a highly durable\\nantibacterial gel-like solution, Silver Shell finish, which contains\\nchitosan-bound silver chloride microparticles. The study investigates the\\ncoating\\'s environmental impact, health risks, and durability during repeated\\nwashing. The structure of the Silver Shell finish was studied using\\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy\\n(EDX). TEM images showed a core-shell structure, with chitosan forming a\\nprotective shell around groupings of silver micro-particles. Field Emission\\nScanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) demonstrated the uniform deposition of\\nSilver Shell on the surface of fabrics. AATCC Test Method 100 was employed to\\nquantitatively analyze the antibacterial properties of fabrics coated with\\nsilver microparticles. Two types of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)\\nand Escherichia coli (E. coli) were used in this study. The antibacterial\\nresults showed that after 75 wash cycles, a 100% reduction for both S. aureus\\nand E. coli in the coated samples using crosslinking agents was observed. The\\ncoated samples without a crosslinking agent exhibited a 99.88% and 99.81%\\nreduction for S. aureus and E. coli after 50 washing cycles. AATCC-147 was\\nperformed to investigate the coated samples\\' leaching properties and the\\ncrosslinking agent\\'s effect against S. aureus and E. coli.

Many recent studies have\\nreported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via\\nmore sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be\\npotential biomarkers of the disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of\\nhow GNN and model explainability techniques have been applied on fMRI datasets\\nfor disorder prediction tasks, with a particular emphasis on the robustness of\\nbiomarkers produced for neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric\\ndisorders. We found that while most studies have performant models, salient\\nfeatures highlighted in these studies vary greatly across studies on the same\\ndisorder and little has been done to evaluate their robustness. To address\\nthese issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective\\nevaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers.\\nWe further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a\\nprediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for\\nfuture research on improving the robustness of potential biomarkers discovered\\nvia GNNs.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yi Hao Chan</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Deepank Girish</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Sukrit Gupta</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jing Xia</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Chockalingam Kasi</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yinan He</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Conghao Wang</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jagath C.

Initially introduced by Savageau, BST\\nfocuses on system stability and employs power laws in modeling biochemical\\nsystems. On the other hand, MCA, pioneered by authors such as Kacser and Burns\\nand Heinrich and Rapoport, emphasizes linearization of the governing equations\\nand describes relationships (known as theorems) between different measures.\\nDespite apparent differences, both frameworks are shown to be equivalent in\\nmany respects. Through a simple example of a linear chain, the paper\\ndemonstrates how BST and MCA yield identical results when analyzing\\nsteady-state behavior and logarithmic gains within biochemical pathways. This\\ncomparative analysis highlights the interchangeability of concepts such as\\nkinetic orders, elasticities and other logarithmic gains.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Herbert M Sauro</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00810v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00810v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"q-bio.MN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"q-bio.MN\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"q-bio.QM\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"q-bio.SC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00817v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-05-01T18:59:52Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-05-01T18:59:52Z</published>\\n    <title>Chaotic behavior in Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of\\n  biodiversity</title>\\n    <summary>  Quantification of chaos is a challenging issue in complex dynamical systems.\\nIn this paper, we discuss the chaotic properties of generalized Lotka-Volterra\\nand May-Leonard models of biodiversity, via the Hamming distance density.

The processing of the ion currents predominantly utilizes\\nneural network-based methods known for their high basecalling accuracy but face\\ndevelopmental bottlenecks at higher resolutions. In light of this, we introduce\\nthe Helicase Hidden Markov Model (HHMM), a novel framework designed to\\nincorporate the dynamics of the helicase motor protein alongside the nucleotide\\nsequence during nanopore sequencing. This model supports the analysis of\\nmillions of distinct states, enhancing our understanding of raw ion currents\\nand their alignment with nucleotide sequences. Our findings demonstrate the\\nutility of HHMM not only as a potent visualization tool but also as an\\neffective base for developing advanced basecalling algorithms.

However, research on LLM creativity has\\nfocused solely on \\\\textit{products}, with little attention on the creative\\n\\\\textit{process}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded\\ncategories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs. We provide an\\nautomated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on\\nthe Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task.\\nWe use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic\\nsimilarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate\\nearlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic\\nspaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to\\ncreativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were\\nfound to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied\\nacross tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their\\nrelationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score\\nhigher on creativity.

      "    <summary>  This paper explores some basic concepts of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST)\n",
      "and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), two frameworks developed to understand\n",
      "the behavior of biochemical networks. Initially introduced by Savageau, BST\n",
      "focuses on system stability and employs power laws in modeling biochemical\n",
      "systems. On the other hand, MCA, pioneered by authors such as Kacser and Burns\n",
      "and Heinrich and Rapoport, emphasizes linearization of the governing equations\n",
      "and describes relationships (known as theorems) between different measures.\n",
      "Despite apparent differences, both frameworks are shown to be equivalent in\n",
      "many respects. Through a simple example of a linear chain, the paper\n",
      "demonstrates how BST and MCA yield identical results when analyzing\n",
      "steady-state behavior and logarithmic gains within biochemical pathways. This\n",
      "comparative analysis highlights the interchangeability of concepts such as\n",

      "          Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies&#39; information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.\n",

      "          The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $&gt;$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.\n",

      "          The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.\n",

      "          The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude. Probabilities of collisions of bodies with Venus were about 0.1-0.3 at a velocity of ejection from Mercury between 4.3 and 10 km/s.\n",

      "          Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.\n",

      "          We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\\approx 500 {\\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \\approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \\approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \\pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \\pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \\pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.\n",

The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence.

We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.\n",

      "          The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.\n",

      "          Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.\n",

      "          Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.\n",

      "          We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.\n",

      "          We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfvén wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\\dot{M}=3.3\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénic <a href=\"http://waves.The\" rel=\"external noopener nofollow\" class=\"link-external link-http\">this http URL</a> nonideal MHD simulation for $\\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\\dot{M}=1.5\\times 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\\dot{M}=2.0\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}/$yr -- comparable to the observed value -- with transient magnetized hot bubbles.\n",

We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.\n",

      "          Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \\sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \\sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\\%$ (at $90\\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \\sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \\sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.\n",

      "          We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\\rm e}=3.1380\\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\\rm H}\\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\\approx14\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\\lambda991.51$ (${\\rm log}\\,n_{\\rm c}=3.3\\,\\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\\sim1.5-6.0\\,Z\\rm\\,sun$, and is located at $\\sim15\\,\\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.\n",

      "          This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.\n",

      "          The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\\,\\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\,R_\\star$ and $f_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.\n",

      "          In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\\rm mag}&lt; 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)&gt;10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.\n",

      "          Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\\gtrsim 30\\degree$, at $b\\lesssim 30 \\degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.\n",

      "          We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.\n",

      "          Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $&lt;0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.\n",

      "          3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet&#39;s direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.\n",

      "          We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \\pm 0.3$ R$_\\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \\pm 1.6$ M$_\\oplus$, $T_\\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \\pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \\pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.\n",

      "          The solar atmosphere displays a sharp temperature gradient, starting from spicules in the chromosphere at $2 \\times 10^4$ K, outward into the corona exceeding $10^6$ K. Plasma turbulence produced by the transverse motion of magnetic fields anchored in the photosphere is likely the energy source producing this gradient. However, very little is known about the turbulent structures near the solar surface. Using the highest spatial resolution white-light total solar eclipse image to date, we measure the transverse correlation length at distances ranging from 0.33 to 9 Mm above the solar surface-two orders of magnitude closer than previous estimates. Our results show that the turbulence injection scale in the chromosphere is ~1.5 Mm, which we associate with the size of granules since they are the only structured features of comparable size. Further, the change in perpendicular correlation length with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4 Mm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower thereafter. We associate this radial gradient with the expansion of the magnetic field in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.\n",

      "          Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \\, M_{\\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \\, M_\\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \\, M_\\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\\odot$ for $\\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.\n",

      "          This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.\n",

      "          Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.\n",

      "          The influence of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) on neutral sulfur lines is considered. A grid of corrections is proposed to take into account the influence of departures from LTE for neutral sulfur lines in the visible and infrared spectral regions, including the H-band. The grid is calculated using the atomic model of sulfur incorporating the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. The inclusion of levels and transitions of ionized sulfur in the atomic model made it possible to expand the range of effective temperatures of stellar photospheres in the grid up to 10000 K. The atomic model was tested in determining the sulfur abundance of 13 stars and showed its adequacy in a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters. In the spectra of all test stars, the sulfur lines are fitted with similar abundances of the element, regardless of the degree of influence of the effects of deviation from LTE on a particular spectral line. For lines of several multiplets, the wavelengths and oscillator strengths were refined. A list of S I lines recommended for determining sulfur abundance has been created.\n",

      "          We present new observations of the cosmic ultraviolet background (CUVB) at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| &gt; 40^{\\circ}$), made using the Alice UV spectrograph on board the New Horizons spacecraft. These observations were taken at about 57 AU from the Sun, outside much of the foreground emission affecting previous missions, and allowed a new determination of the spectrum of the CUVB between 912 -- 1100~Å and 1400 -- 1800~Å. We found a linear correlation between the CUVB and the Planck E(B~-~V) with offsets at zero-reddening of $221 \\pm 11$ photon units at 1000~Å and $264 \\pm 24$ \\photu\\ at 1500~Å ($4.4 \\pm 0.2$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1000~Å and $5.3 \\pm 0.5$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1500~Å). The former is the first firm detection of the offset in the range 912 -- 1100 Å while the latter result confirms previous results from \\galex, showing that there is little emission from the Solar System from 1400 -- 1800 Å. About half of the offset may be explained by known sources (the integrated light of unresolved galaxies, unresolved stars, emission from ionized gas, and two-photon emission from warm hydrogen in the halo) with the source of the remaining emission as yet unidentified. There is no detectable emission below the Lyman limit with an upper limit of $3.2 \\pm 3.0$ photon units.\n",

      "          We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (&lt; 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (&lt; 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\\circ$ to 82$^\\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\\Theta$ (~ 180$^\\circ$ to 240$^\\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n",

      "          This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A &lt; 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The mass fractions of these nuclei were calculated using the Sahas equation which assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium for a set of initial conditions ($T_9$, $\\rho$ and $Y_e$) that represents the trajectory which a massive stars central region takes after its silicon core burns. Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK. In comparison with large scale shell model, our computed rates were found bigger at high values of core temperature. The current study may contribute in a more realistic simu lation of stellar evolution processes and modeling of core collapse supernovae.\n",

      "          The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppost <a href=\"http://model.The\" rel=\"external noopener nofollow\" class=\"link-external link-http\">this http URL</a> most recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups. Larger black hole mass and considerably lower Eddington ratio would allow to see larger differences between a single lamppost and a two-lampost model. UV/optical reverberation mapping is not very sensitive to the vertical extension of the corona.\n",

      "          A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\\times 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.\n",

      "          In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $&gt; 80\\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.\n",

      "          In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.\n",

      "          Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\\sigma\\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E&gt;B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection&#39;&#39; stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\\zeta(\\epsilon^\\ast,\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$) by $E&gt;B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\\epsilon^\\ast=\\sigma/4$; here, $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$; for $\\sigma\\gtrsim 50$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}/\\sigma\\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\\gtrsim 80\\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\\epsilon^\\ast=\\sigma/4$ occurs in $E&gt;B$ regions. We find that $\\zeta$ is independent of simulation box size $L_x$, as long as $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$ is normalized to the maximum particle energy, which scales as $\\epsilon_{\\rm max}\\propto L_{\\rm x}^{1/2}$ in 2D. The distribution of energy gains $\\epsilon_{\\chi}$ acquired in $E&gt;B$ regions can be modeled as $dN/d\\epsilon_{\\chi}\\propto\\epsilon_{\\chi}^{-0.35}\\exp[-(\\epsilon_{\\chi}/0.06\\,\\sigma)^{0.5}]$. Our results help assess the role of electric dominance in relativistic reconnection with vanishing guide fields, which may be realized in the magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars.\n",

      "          The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\\mathrm{UV}\\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\\geq14$ subset of the $z\\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\\lesssim\\alpha\\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.\n",

      "          In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.\n",

      "          Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the two <a href=\"http://effects.To\" rel=\"external noopener nofollow\" class=\"link-external link-http\">this http URL</a> address this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\mathrm{p}}(r_{\\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.\n",

      "          Strong He I 1083 nm atomic line signals have been previously measured during total solar eclipses at coronal heights above the lunar limb. This rather unexpected measurement has kindled a discussion about the hypothesized presence of significant amounts of neutral helium at coronal conditions. We performed spectroscopic observations of the He I 1083 nm spectroscopic region with the newly built CHEESE instrument during the April 8th 2024 total solar eclipse to test the presence of He I 1083 in the solar corona. We detected the He I 1083, the forbidden coronal line Fe XIII 1074.7 nm, as well as the chromospheric H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\\gamma} line in our eclipse observations. The chromospheric He I 1083 and H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\\gamma} lines are detected in the corona as well as on the lunar disc. Our findings point toward a non-solar origin of the He I 1083 signal during the April 8th 2024 eclipse that challenge the notion of abundant neutral helium in the solar corona inferred from eclipse observations.\n",

      "          We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT&#39;s performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.\n",

      "          We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO&#39;s Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting pulsed CH maser emission in the interstellar medium stimulated by pulsar photons.\n",

      "          The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now. However, more precise and repetitive measurements, which might be available in near future, are needed for definite conclusions.\n",

      "          We report the analysis of the detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7, which features a massive white dwarf. Using LAMOST and SDSS spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and radial velocities of both components. SED fitting of photometric data from GALEX, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 yielded the effective temperatures and photometric radii. Eclipsing analysis of high-speed photometric data from the Liverpool Telescope provided orbital inclination, masses, radii, and related physical parameters. The white dwarf in this system has a mass of $1.05 \\pm 0.09 \\, M_\\odot$ and a radius of $0.0090 \\pm 0.0008 \\, R_\\odot$, while the main-sequence star has a mass of $0.299 \\pm 0.045 \\, M_\\odot$ and a radius of $0.286 \\pm 0.018 \\, R_\\odot$. Emission lines observed in the spectra indicate the likely presence of stellar magnetic activity in this system. The relatively cool temperature of the white dwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB) that has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white dwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic variable (dCV) crossing the period gap. We suggest that the system is more likely to be a PCEB, and it is predicted to evolve into a cataclysmic variable and begin mass transfer in approximately 0.27 Gyr.\n",

      "          We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z&lt;1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.\n",

      "          We present the HI surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\\sim10^{18.1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.\n",

      "          Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\\approx$10\\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.\n",

      "          We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and total surface magnetic flux (Phi), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.\n",

      "          In-situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.\n",

      "          The debris disk around HD 181327 shows a significant asymmetry in its surface brightness profile when viewed in visible light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope STIS instrument show an arc of approximately 90 degrees of higher optical depth at a distance of 84 au from the star. We find that a 2-5 Jupiter-mass planet on a circular orbit at 62 au can produce and maintain a similar feature if the collisional lifetime of dust in the disk is at least 25 kiloyears, and smaller mass planets can produce similar results on longer timescales. We also find that the surface brightness asymmetry is much less pronounced at larger particle sizes, which may account for the fact that observations of HD181327 at longer wavelengths have not reported such an arc. We predict that if a planet is producing the arc in question, the planet is along the line joining the star to the feature, and make some estimates of its observability.\n",

      "          We introduce the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a novel data-driven Bayesian approach to modelling radio foregrounds at frequencies &lt;400~MHz. B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors. This is the first of two papers, and is focused on validation of B-GSMs Bayesian framework, the second paper will present results of deployment on real data and introduce the low-frequency sky model which will be available for public download.\n",

      "          Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.\n",

      "          This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell&#39;s equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.\n",

      "          This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\\Lambda_m^{f(\\mathcal{R})}$ and $\\Lambda_m^{\\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.\n",

      "          Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter&#39;s de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.\n",

      "          We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.\n",

      "          We reexamine the nuclear structure properties of waiting point nuclei around A70 using the interacting boson model 1 (IBM 1) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) model. Effective density dependent meson exchange functional (DD ME2) and density dependent point coupling functional (DD PC1) were used for the RMF calculations. We calculated the energy levels, the geometric shapes, binding and separation energies of nucleons and quadrupole deformation parameters (\\b{eta}2). The shape coexistence phenomena in A 70 nuclei (68Se, 70Se, 70Br, 70Kr, 72Kr, 74Kr, 74Rb, and 74Sr) was later investigated. Spherical and deformed shapes of the selected waiting point nuclei were computed using the IBM 1 and RMF models, respectively. The proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model was used to calculate \\b{eta} decay properties (Gamow Teller strength distributions, \\b{eta} decay half lives, and branching ratios) of selected nuclei as a function of \\b{eta}2. The results revealed a significant variation in calculated half lives and Gamow Teller strength distributions as the shape parameter was changed. The \\b{eta}2 computed via DD ME2 functional resulted in half lives in best agreement with the measured data.\n",

      "          Using tellurium dioxide as a target, we calculate uncertainties on 90% upper confidence limits of Galilean effective field theory (Galilean EFT) couplings to a WIMP dark matter particle due to uncertainties in nuclear shell models. We find that these uncertainties in naturally-occurring tellurium isotopes are comparable across the different Galilean EFT couplings to uncertainties in xenon, with some reaching over 100%. We also consider the effect these nuclear uncertainties have on estimates of the annual modulation of dark matter from these searches, finding that the uncertainties in the modulation amplitude are proportional to the non-modulating upper confidence limit uncertainties. We also show that the determination of the modulation phase is insensitive to changes in the nuclear model for a given isotope.\n",

      "          In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-5}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\\phi}=\\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.\n",

      "          The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew&#39;s correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.\n",

      "          We present a detailed investigation on the structure of neutron stars, incorporating the presence of hyperons within a relativistic model under the mean-field approximation. Employing coupling constants derived from QCD sum rules, we explore the particle fraction in beta equilibrium and establish the mass-radius relationship for neutron stars with hyperonic matter. Additionally, we compute the stellar Love number ($\\mathcal{K}_{2}$) and the tidal deformability parameter ($\\varLambda$), providing valuable insights into the dynamical properties of these celestial objects. Through comparison with theoretical predictions and observational data, our results exhibit good agreement, affirming the validity of our approach. These findings contribute significantly to refining the understanding of neutron star physics, particularly in environments containing hyperons, and offer essential constraints on the equation of state governing such extreme astrophysical conditions.\n",

      "          We study the first-order phase transitions and the emerging stochastic gravitational wave spectrum in a minimal leptoquark extension of the Standard Model that explains active neutrino oscillation data while satisfying current flavor physics constraints. This model exhibits diverse phase transition patterns, including color symmetry-breaking scenarios in the early Universe. Strong correlations between model parameters and gravitational-wave signals yield testable predictions for future experiments such as LISA, BBO, and DECIGO. Specifically, a detectable signal in the mHz$\\unicode{x2013}$0.1~Hz frequency range features color-restoration and leptoquark masses near $1.5~\\mathrm{TeV}$. With this article, we also present the first application in the literature of \\texttt{Dratopi}. This is a soon-to-be-released tool for phase transition analysis using the dimensional reduction formalism, that interfaces the \\texttt{DRalgo} package with \\texttt{Python} and a slightly modified version of \\texttt{CosmoTransitions}.\n",

      "          Recently, a study on optical properties and shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\\gamma$. Following the same approach, we considered its rotating counterpart which is precisely a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity. The deviation between the quantum-corrected Kerr and Kerr black holes has been investigated by the analysis of horizon structure and null geodesics by assuming a fixed value of $\\gamma$. We have proved a theorem dealing with the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind by incorporating the convexity of effective potential of the Kerr black hole. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum-corrected and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and lastly the shadow analysis is incorporated in comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. We have found that the quantum correction significantly reduces the extremal spin value and hence the size of the black hole as compared to Kerr black hole. Moreover, the unstable null orbits for quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. Lastly, we found that the quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*.\n",

      "          Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.\n",

      "          We present the first simulations of core-collapse supernovae in axial symmetry with feedback from fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC). Our schematic treatment of FFCs assumes instantaneous flavor equilibration under the constraint of lepton-number conservation individually for each flavor. Systematically varying the spatial domain where FFCs are assumed to occur, we find that they facilitate SN explosions in low-mass (9-12 solar masses) progenitors that otherwise explode with longer time delays, whereas FFCs weaken the tendency to explode of higher-mass (around 20 solar masses) progenitors.\n",

      "          Magnetar is a neutron star with an ultrahigh magnetic field ($\\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G). The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 is not only one of the most active magnetars detected so far, but also the unique confirmed source of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is dedicated to monitor gamma-ray transients all over the sky, including magnetar short bursts. Here we report the GECAM observations of the burst activity of SGR J1935+2154 from January 2021 to December 2022, which results in a unique and valuable data set for this important magnetar. With a targeted search of GECAM data, 159 bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are detected by GECAM-B while 97 bursts by GECAM-C, including the X-ray burst associated with a bright radio burst. We find that both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow lognormal distributions. The period of burst activity is $134\\pm20$ days, thus the burst activity could be generally divided into four active episodes over these two years. Interestingly, the hardness ratio of X-ray bursts tends to be softer during these two years, especially during the active episode with radio bursts detected.\n",

      "          The UltraViolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-26 Treasury Program, allocated in total 164 orbits of primary Wide-Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and Visible light F275W imaging with coordinated parallel Advanced Camera for Surveys F435W imaging, on four of the five premier extragalactic survey fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. We introduce this survey by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the absolute escape fraction ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}$) of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation through stacking the UV images of a population of star-forming galaxies with secure redshifts at $2.4\\leq z\\leq3.0$. Our stacking benefits from the catalogs of high-quality spectroscopic redshifts compiled from archival ground-based data and HST slitless spectroscopy, carefully vetted by dedicated visual inspection efforts. We develop a robust stacking method to apply to 10 samples of in total 56 galaxies, and perform detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, to take into account the sample variance of the mean IGM transmission when measuring $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}$. The full stack at $z\\approx2.44$ from 28 galaxies places a stringent 1-$\\sigma$ upper limit of $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}\\lesssim5\\%$, whereas the full stack at $z\\approx2.72$ of equal number of galaxies gives an upper limit of $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}\\lesssim26\\%$ at 1-$\\sigma$ confidence level. These new F275W and F435W imaging mosaics from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).\n",

      "          We analyse the M31 halo and its substructure within a projected radius of 120 kpc using a combination of Subaru/HSC $\\textit{NB515}$ and CFHT/MegaCam $\\textit{g}$- \\&amp; $\\textit{i}$-bands. We succeed in separating M31&#39;s halo stars from foreground contamination with $\\sim$ 90 \\% accuracy by using the surface gravity sensitive $\\textit{NB515}$ filter. Based on the selected M31 halo stars, we discover three new substructures, which associate with the Giant Southern Stream (GSS) based on their photometric metallicity estimates. We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity estimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are reproduced in our study, we find that the North-Western stream shows a steeper distance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely to have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the eastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been resolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity distribution and surface brightness profile using the $\\textit{NB515}$-selected halo stars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich halo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile with an index of $\\alpha=-1.65\\pm0.02$, $-2.82\\pm0.01$, and $-2.44\\pm0.01$, respectively. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo profile, its photometric metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with nonmonotonic trends with radius, suggesting that the halo population had insufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.\n",

      "          This book chapter explores key aspects of neutron stars, pulsar glitches, tidal deformability, fast pulsars, the equation of state, and strange quark matter stars. Challenges in directly measuring neutron star radius have led to reliance on spectroscopic and timing techniques, with uncertainties addressed through careful source selection and theoretical modeling. Pulsar glitches reveal insights into the equation of state through angular momentum transfer within the neutron star. Tidal deformability is crucial in gravitational-wave astronomy, exemplified by the GW170817 event. Fast pulsars, instrumental in astrophysical testing, are classified into ordinary pulsars, millisecond pulsars, and magnetars. The EOS is vital for understanding neutron star internal structure, explored through various models. The chapter delves into the theoretical framework for rotating neutron stars, addressing uniform and differential rotation scenarios and their impacts on mass and radius. Additionally, the intriguing concept of quark stars and strange dwarfs is investigated. The various topics discussed in this book chapter contribute to a broader understanding of dense matter physics, astrophysical phenomena, and the potential for transformative discoveries through advanced observational techniques and technologies like gravitational wave detectors, radio telescopes, and X-ray telescopes.\n",

      "          This study investigates the realization of R-symmetric Higgs inflation within the framework of no-scale-like supergravity, aiming to elucidate the formation of primordial black holes and observable gravitational waves within a class of GUT models. We explore the possibility of an ultra-slow-roll phase in a hybrid inflation framework, where the GUT Higgs field primarily takes on the role of the inflaton. The amplification of the scalar power spectrum gives rise to scalar-induced gravitational waves and the generation of primordial black holes. The predicted stochastic gravitational wave background falls within the sensitivity range of existing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, while primordial black holes hold the potential to explain the abundance of dark matter. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of the leading-order nonrenormalizable term in the superpotential of achieving inflationary observables consistent with the latest experimental data. Additionally, the predicted range of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, a key measure of primordial gravitational waves, lies within the observational window of future experiments searching for B-mode polarization patterns in cosmic microwave background data.\n",

      "          The impact response of rubble-pile asteroids is essential for both elucidating their formation and evolution history and evaluating the efficacy of impact defense strategies. Although state-of-the-art numerical simulations have allowed for the replication of many macroscopic impact characteristics consistent with observations, the understanding of dynamics and response mechanisms within rubble-pile structures remains incomplete and requires further in-depth investigation. Such understanding is critical for assessing the effects and safety of impact defense missions. The loose structure of rubble-pile asteroids affects inhomogeneous internal stress propagation via inherent force chains, which may lead to structural fracturing. We demonstrate this phenomenon here, using a proof-of-principle two-dimensional model of granular aggregates. We find that the velocity response front to impact disturbances preferentially propagates along pre-existing force chains, with particles not in chains responding more slowly. The sites within the response zone where high dynamic stresses manifest are strongly correlated with these initial force chains, and the damages that result are predominantly located within areas enclosed by these chains. The strong correlation between pre-existing force chains and dynamic response is independent of the location, magnitude, direction of the disturbance velocity, or the aggregate&#39;s particle size distribution. All evidence suggests that the core reasons for this propagation preference lie in the structural heterogeneity of granular aggregates and the resulting differences in mechanical wave propagation. This investigation provides guidance for future research aimed at quantitatively assessing fragmentation risks based on the statistical properties of force chains.\n",

      "          Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients, with modern survey telescopes generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, Multi-Class Isolation Forests (\\texttt{MCIF}), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation and helps the neural network handle irregular sampling and model inter-passband relationships. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations matching the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method discovered $41\\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.\n",

      "          Relativistic jets from accreting supermassive black holes at cosmological distances can be powerful emitters of $\\gamma$-rays. However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $\\gamma$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $\\gamma$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $\\gamma$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $\\gamma$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $\\gamma$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.\n",

      "          This paper presents the specification, design, and development of the Visible Camera (VIS) on the ESA Euclid mission. VIS is a large optical-band imager with a field of view of 0.54 deg^2 sampled at 0.1&#34; with an array of 609 Megapixels and spatial resolution of 0.18&#34;. It will be used to survey approximately 14,000 deg^2 of extragalactic sky to measure the distortion of galaxies in the redshift range z=0.1-1.5 resulting from weak gravitational lensing, one of the two principal cosmology probes of Euclid. With photometric redshifts, the distribution of dark matter can be mapped in three dimensions, and, from how this has changed with look-back time, the nature of dark energy and theories of gravity can be constrained. The entire VIS focal plane will be transmitted to provide the largest images of the Universe from space to date, reaching m_AB&gt;24.5 with S/N &gt;10 in a single broad I_E~(r+i+z) band over a six year survey. The particularly challenging aspects of the instrument are the control and calibration of observational biases, which lead to stringent performance requirements and calibration regimes. With its combination of spatial resolution, calibration knowledge, depth, and area covering most of the extra-Galactic sky, VIS will also provide a legacy data set for many other fields. This paper discusses the rationale behind the VIS concept and describes the instrument design and development before reporting the pre-launch performance derived from ground calibrations and brief results from the in-orbit commissioning. VIS should reach fainter than m_AB=25 with S/N&gt;10 for galaxies of full-width half-maximum of 0.3&#34; in a 1.3&#34; diameter aperture over the Wide Survey, and m_AB&gt;26.4 for a Deep Survey that will cover more than 50 deg^2. The paper also describes how VIS works with the other Euclid components of survey, telescope, and science data processing to extract the cosmological information.\n",

      "          Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provides us with a wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.\n",

      "          In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.\n",

      "          Empirically, the total number (or total mass) of globular clusters bound in a single galactic system correlates with the viral mass of the system. The form of this relation and its intrinsic scatter are potentially valuable constraints on theories of globular cluster formation and galaxy evolution. In this work, we use the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey to make a large-scale, homogeneous estimate of GC abundance around 707 galaxies at distances $\\lesssim 30\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ with luminosities $8 \\leq \\log_{10}L/\\mathrm{L}_\\odot \\leq 11.5$. The combination of depth and sky coverage in DESI-LS allow us to extend the techniques used by previous ground-based photometric GC surveys to a larger and potentially more representative sample of galaxies. We find average GC counts and radial profiles that are broadly consistent with the literature on individual galaxies, including good agreement with the distribution of GCs in the Milky Way, demonstrating the viability of DESI-LS images for this purpose. We find a relation between GC counts and virial mass in agreement with previous estimates based on heterogenous datasets, except at the lowest masses we probe, where we find a larger scatter in the number of cluster candidates and a slightly higher average count.\n",

      "          We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds, which illustrates the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability at a characteristic mass scale determined by the microphysics of the gas. The approach is based on developing the &#34;one-zone&#34; density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities, we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, we show that our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.\n",

      "          Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant&#39; amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud&#39; which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD&#39;s sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\\mu$ is around $3\\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\\mu$ up to $\\approx 5.5\\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\\mu \\in (3-4.5)\\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\\mu \\in (3-6)\\times10^{-11}$ eV.\n",

      "          Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\\tau/m \\sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.\n",

      "          Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\\tt{MAG\\_AUTO} &lt; 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online. We have also included an excellent quad candidate in the appendix, discovered serendipitously during the fine-tuning process of the CNN.\n",

      "          The current accelerated expansion of the Universe remains ones of the most intriguing topics in modern cosmology, driving the search for innovative statistical techniques. Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly enhanced its application across various scientific fields, including physics, and particularly cosmology, where data analysis plays a crucial role in problem-solving. In this work, a non-parametric regression method with Gaussian processes is presented along with several applications to reconstruct some cosmological observables, such as the deceleration parameter and the dark energy equation of state, in order to contribute with some information that helps to clarify the behavior of the Universe. It was found that the results are consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM and the predicted value of the Hubble parameter at redshift zero is $H_{0}=68.798\\pm 6.340(1\\sigma) \\text{ km}\\text{ s}^{-1}\\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$.\n",

      "          The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. Parameters controlling stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, non-linear interactions between AGN and SNe feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.\n",

      "          We present the design, rationale, properties and catalogs of the MusE Gas FLOw and Wind survey (MEGAFLOW), a survey of the cool gaseous halos of $z\\sim1$ galaxies using low-ionization MgII absorption systems. The survey consists of 22 quasar fields selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having multiple ($\\geq3$) strong MgII absorption lines over the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$. Each quasar was observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), for a total of 85~hr and 63~hr, respectively. The UVES data resulted in 127 MgII absorption lines over $0.25&lt;z&lt;1.6$, with a median rest-frame equivalent width (REW) $3\\sigma$ limit of $\\approx 0.05$~Å. The MUSE data resulted in $\\sim$2400 galaxies of which 1403 with redshift confidence ZCONF$&gt;1$, i.e. more than 60 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$. They were identified using a dual detection algorithm based on both continuum and emission line objects. The achieved [OII] 50\\%\\ completeness is 3.7$\\times 10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ (corresponding to SFR$&gt;0.01$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=1$) using realistic mock [OII] emitters and the 50\\%\\ completeness is $m_{F775W}\\approx26$ AB magnitudes for continuum sources. We find that (i) the fraction of [OII] emitting galaxies which have no continuum is $\\sim15$\\%; (ii) the success rate in identifying at least one galaxy within 500 km/s and 100 kpc is $\\approx90$\\%\\ for MgII absorptions with $W_r^{2796}\\gtrsim0.5$~Å; (iii) the mean number of galaxies per MgII absorption is $2.9\\pm1.6$ within the MUSE field-of-view; (iv) of the 80 MgII systems at $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$, 40 (20) have 1 (2) galaxies within 100 kpc, respectively; (v) all but two host galaxies have stellar masses $M_\\star&gt;10^9$ M$_\\odot$, and star-formation rates $&gt;1$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.\n",

      "          The Cosmological Principle is a cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology and shapes how we view the Universe and our place within it. It is imperative, then, to devise multiple observational tests which can identify and quantify possible violations of this foundational principle. One possible method of probing large-scale anisotropies involves the use of weak gravitational lensing. We revisit this approach in order to analyse the imprint of late-time anisotropic expansion on cosmic shear. We show that the cross-correlation of shear $E$- and $B$-modes on large scales can be used to constrain the magnitude (and possibly direction) of anisotropic expansion. We estimate the signal to noise for multipoles $10\\lesssim \\ell\\lesssim 100$ that is achievable by a Euclid-like survey. Our findings suggest that such a survey could detect the $E$-$B$ signal for reasonable values of the late-time anisotropy parameter.\n",

      "          We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of cluster galaxy populations classified according to their dominant source of gas ionization, namely: star-forming (SF) galaxies, optical active galactic nuclei (AGN), mixed SF plus AGN ionization (transition objects, T), and quiescent (Q) galaxies. We stack 8892 member galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate the observed projected profiles of numerical density and velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_P(R)$, of each galaxy population. The MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equations inversion technique are used to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles of the galaxy populations in both parametric and non-parametric ways. We find that Q (SF) galaxies display the lowest (highest) typical cluster-centric distances and velocity dispersion values. Transition galaxies are more concentrated and tend to exhibit lower velocity dispersion values than SF galaxies. Galaxies that host an optical AGN are as concentrated as Q galaxies but display velocity dispersion values similar to those of the SF population. MAMPOSSt is able to find equilibrium solutions that successfully recover the observed $\\sigma_P(R)$ profile only for the Q, T, and AGN populations. We find that the orbits of all populations are consistent with isotropy in the inner regions, becoming increasingly radial with the distance from the cluster centre. These results suggest that Q galaxies are in equilibrium within their clusters, while SF galaxies have more recently arrived in the cluster environment. Finally, the T and AGN populations appear to be in an intermediate dynamical state between those of the SF and Q populations.\n",

One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package.

      "          We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary region. Although our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.\n",

      "          The self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) paradigm offers a potential solution to the small-scale structure problems faced by collision-less cold dark matter. This framework incorporates self-interactions among dark matter particles, typically mediated by a particle with a MeV-scale mass. Recent evidences of nano-Hertz gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, and PPTA suggest the occurrence of a first-order phase transition (FOPT) at a MeV-scale temperature. Considering the close proximity between these two scales, we propose that the mediator mass in the SIDM model originates from the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)&#39;$ symmetry, which is driven by the FOPT indicated by PTA data. Consequently, the alignment of these two scales is believed to be deeply connected by the same underlying physics. By extensively exploring the parameter space, remarkably, we find that the parameter space favored by SIDM just provides an explanation for the PTA data.\n",

      "          We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.\n",

      "          We explore the cosmological and astrophysical implications of a realistic hybrid inflation model based on flipped $SU(5)$. The model contains superheavy metastable cosmic strings arising from a waterfall field that encounters a limited number of $e$-foldings during the inflationary phase. In addition to the gravitational waves emitted by the metastable strings, there also appear scalar induced gravitational waves linked to the waterfall phase transition. These two independent sources of gravitational waves can yield a combined spectrum that is compatible with the recent PTA measurements, and with additional features that can be probed in future experiments. We also show the appearance of primordial black holes with mass on the order of $10^{29}$ g from the waterfall phase transition, and with an abundance that can be tested in the gravitational lensing experiments.\n",

      "          We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Tidal dynamics in the McVittie model involves the sum of the curvature due to the inhomogeneity, the curvature due to the background FLRW spacetime and a mixed term, while tidal dynamics in the particular LTB model turns out to be qualitatively the same as in the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.\n",

      "          The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV and probing new physics of the seesaw scale poses a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.\n",

      "          Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli&#39;s arXiv/<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13640\" data-arxiv-id=\"2412.13640\" class=\"link-https\">2412.13640</a> paper, the eclipse is defined as the &#39;Shepseskaf eclipse&#39;. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the &#39;last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf&#39;. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13640\" data-arxiv-id=\"2412.13640\" class=\"link-https\">2412.13640</a> paper we find mentioned by Magli the pyramid of Cheops (that is Akhet Khufu, a name which is generally translated as the Khufu&#39;s horizon) and the symbol of the &#39;solarized&#39; horizon, N27 of the Gardiner&#39;s list, it is necessary to stress that the word Akhet was written with the crested ibis, G25, as clearly shown by the Wadi al-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu&#39;s reign. Mark Lehner, 2001, recognizing a translation problem, rendered Akhet Khufu as the &#39;Spirit of Khufu&#39;. The use of the crested ibis, in a locution translated as &#39;dwellers of the horizon&#39; is attested in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.\n",

Insights on Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks,"Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",['John F.

Hunting for the candidates of Changing-Look Blazar using Mclust Clustering Analysis,"The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $>$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.","['Shi-Ju Kang', 'Shan-Shan Ren', 'Yong-Gang Zheng', 'Qingwen Wu']",7.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00094,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Active galactic nuclei (16) – Blazars (164) — BL Lacertae objects (158) — Flat-spectrum radio quasars (2163) 1'],2025-01-03
First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs,"The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.","['Mathilde Mâlin', 'Anthony Boccaletti', 'Clément Perrot', 'Pierre Baudoz', 'Daniel Rouan', 'Pierre-Olivier Lagage', 'Rens Waters', 'Manuel Güdel', 'Thomas Henning', 'Bart Vandenbussche', 'Olivier Absil', 'David Barrado', 'Benjamin Charnay', 'Elodie Choquet', 'Christophe Cossou', 'Camilla Danielski', 'Leen Decin', 'Adrian M.

Exchange of meteorites between the terrestrial planets and the Moon,"The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude.

Autoencoder Reconstruction of Cosmological Microlensing Magnification Maps,"Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.","['Somayeh Khakpash', 'Federica Bianco', 'Georgios Vernardos', 'Gregory Dobler', 'Charles Keeton']",11.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00153,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal,,['- Interdisciplinary astronomy(804) 1'],2025-01-03
"The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays","We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.","['Hisashi Hayakawa', 'Edward W.

The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence.

Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?,"Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.","['Di Wu', 'Jing-Zhi Zhou', 'Yu-Ting Kuang', 'Zhi-Chao Li', 'Zhe Chang', 'Qing-Guo Huang']",7.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00228,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-03
Improving image quality of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the ASO-S mission,"The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.","['Hui Liu', 'Hui Li', 'Sizhong Zou', 'Kaifan Ji', 'Zhenyu Jin', 'Jiahui Shan', 'Jingwei Li', 'Guanglu Shi', 'Yu Huang', 'Li Feng', 'Jianchao Xue', 'Qiao Li', 'Dechao Song', 'Ying Li']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00231,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['techniques: image processing — sun: chromosphere — sun: flares — methods: numerical'],2025-01-03
On the Duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.",['Bing Zhang'],1.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00239,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Gamma-ray bursts', 'Relativistic fluid dynamics 1']",2025-01-03
An Investigation into the Variability of Luminous Blue Variable Stars with TESS,"Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.","['Becca Spejcher', 'Noel D.

"Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation","We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.","['Sripan Mondal', 'Akash Bairagi', 'A.

Red Giant Winds Driven by Alfv\'en Waves with Magnetic Diffusion,"We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfvén wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}=3.3\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénicthis http URLnonideal MHD simulation for $\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\dot{M}=1.5\times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\dot{M}=2.0\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr -- comparable to the observed value -- with transient magnetized hot bubbles.","['Takeru K.

Primordial Black Hole Formation from Power Spectrum with Finite-width,"Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.","['Shi Pi', 'Misao Sasaki', 'Volodymyr Takhistov', 'Jianing Wang']",30.0,61.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00295,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-03
A novel analysis of contamination in Lyman-break galaxy samples at $\boldsymbol{z\sim6-8}$: spatial correlation with intermediate-redshift galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z\sim1.3-2}$,"Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\%$ (at $90\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.","['Miftahul Hilmi', 'Nicha Leethochawalit', 'Michele Trenti', 'Benjamin Metha']",8.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00301,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 532, Issue 1, July 2024, Pages 920-931","['thousands of galaxy candi- dates at redshift 𝑧≳6have been recently discovered', 'galaxies: high-redshift – surveys – methods: statistical 1 INTRODUCTION Thanks to space-based observatories', 'primarily from several large survey programs conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (Schmidt et al']",2025-01-03
Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar,"We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\rm e}=3.1380\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\rm H}\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\approx14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\lambda991.51$ (${\rm log}\,n_{\rm c}=3.3\,\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\sim1.5-6.0\,Z\rm\,sun$, and is located at $\sim15\,\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.","['Qiguo Tian', 'Lei Hao', 'Yipeng Zhou', 'Xiheng Shi', 'Tuo Ji', 'Peng Jiang', 'Lin Lin', 'Zhenya Zheng', 'Hongyan Zhou']",15.0,17.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00311,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,"2024, ApJ, 977, 269",['galaxies: active — quasars: absorption lines — quasars: ind ividual (SDSS 122040'],2025-01-03
An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars II: Refined Solar Abundances via Extended Wavelength Coverage to 10 000 \AA,"This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.","['T. Şahin', 'F.

Circumstellar emission of Cepheids across the instability strip: Mid-infrared observations with VLTI/MATISSE,"The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\,\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\,R_\star$ and $f_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.","['V. Hocdé', 'A. Matter', 'N. Nardetto', 'A. Gallenne', 'P.

An efficient unsupervised classification model for galaxy morphology: Voting clustering based on coding from ConvNeXt large model,"In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\rm mag}< 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)>10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.","['Guanwen Fang', 'Yao Dai', 'Zesen Lin', 'Chichun Zhou', 'Jie Song', 'Yizhou Gu', 'Xiaotong Guo', 'Anqi Mao', 'Xu Kong']",12.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00380,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,A&A,,['Galaxy: general – Galaxy: structure – galaxies: statistics – Astrostatistics techniques – Astronomy data analysis 1'],2025-01-03
Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band,"Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\gtrsim 30\degree$, at $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.","['Yanping Cong', 'Bin Yue', 'Yidong Xu', 'Furen Deng', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Xuelei Chen']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00431,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Interstellar medium (847) — Interstellar plasma (851)— Interstellar absorption (831)— Milky Way Galaxy (1054) — Radio interferometers (1345) 1'],2025-01-03
A Novel Survey for Young Substellar Objects with the W-band Filter. VII. Water-Bearing Objects in the Core of the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex,"We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.","['Tanvi Sharma', 'Wen-Ping Chen', 'Beth Biller', 'Loic Albert', 'Belinda Damian', 'Jessy Jose', 'Bhavana Lalchand', 'Michael C.

JWST-ALMA Study of a Hub-Filament System in the Nascent Phase,"Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $<0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.","['N. K.

Fermi-LAT Discovery of a Gamma-ray Outburst from the Peculiar Compact Steep Spectrum Radiogalaxy 3C 216,"3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.","['Federica Giacchino', 'Giovanni La Mura', 'Stefano Ciprini', 'Dario Gasparrini', 'Marcello Giroletti', 'Marco Laurenti']",7.0,11.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00582,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma rays: galaxies — gamma-ray astronomy — high energy astrophysics — gamma-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — radio galaxies: individual (3C 216) — X-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — blazars — relativistic jets — spectral energy distribution 1'],2025-01-03
Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST,"We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.","['Andrew W.

Measurement of Turbulence Injection Scale Down to the Chromosphere,"The solar atmosphere displays a sharp temperature gradient, starting from spicules in the chromosphere at $2 \times 10^4$ K, outward into the corona exceeding $10^6$ K. Plasma turbulence produced by the transverse motion of magnetic fields anchored in the photosphere is likely the energy source producing this gradient. However, very little is known about the turbulent structures near the solar surface. Using the highest spatial resolution white-light total solar eclipse image to date, we measure the transverse correlation length at distances ranging from 0.33 to 9 Mm above the solar surface-two orders of magnitude closer than previous estimates. Our results show that the turbulence injection scale in the chromosphere is ~1.5 Mm, which we associate with the size of granules since they are the only structured features of comparable size. Further, the change in perpendicular correlation length with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4 Mm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower thereafter. We associate this radial gradient with the expansion of the magnetic field in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.","['Zac Bailey', 'Riddhi Bandyopadhyay', 'Shadia Habbal', 'Miloslav Druckmüller']",5.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00676,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ letters on Dec 21st 2024,,[],2025-01-03
Role of gravitational decoupling on theoretical insights of relativistic massive compact stars in the mass gap,"Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \, M_{\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\odot$ for $\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.","['S.K.Maurya', 'A. Errehymy', 'Ksh.

"Depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the solar photosphere","This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.","['S. Qutub', 'Y.N. Kalugina', 'M.

Prospects for measuring neutrino mass with 21-cm forest,"Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.","['Yue Shao', 'Guo-Hong Du', 'Tian-Nuo Li', 'Xin Zhang']",4.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00769,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-03
Influence of departures from LTE on determinations of the sulfur abundances in A-K type stars,"The influence of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) on neutral sulfur lines is considered. A grid of corrections is proposed to take into account the influence of departures from LTE for neutral sulfur lines in the visible and infrared spectral regions, including the H-band. The grid is calculated using the atomic model of sulfur incorporating the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. The inclusion of levels and transitions of ionized sulfur in the atomic model made it possible to expand the range of effective temperatures of stellar photospheres in the grid up to 10000 K. The atomic model was tested in determining the sulfur abundance of 13 stars and showed its adequacy in a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters. In the spectra of all test stars, the sulfur lines are fitted with similar abundances of the element, regardless of the degree of influence of the effects of deviation from LTE on a particular spectral line. For lines of several multiplets, the wavelengths and oscillator strengths were refined. A list of S I lines recommended for determining sulfur abundance has been created.","['S. A. Korotin', 'K. O.

Excess Ultraviolet Emission at High Galactic Latitudes: A New Horizons View,"We present new observations of the cosmic ultraviolet background (CUVB) at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 40^{\circ}$), made using the Alice UV spectrograph on board the New Horizons spacecraft. These observations were taken at about 57 AU from the Sun, outside much of the foreground emission affecting previous missions, and allowed a new determination of the spectrum of the CUVB between 912 -- 1100~Å and 1400 -- 1800~Å. We found a linear correlation between the CUVB and the Planck E(B~-~V) with offsets at zero-reddening of $221 \pm 11$ photon units at 1000~Å and $264 \pm 24$ \photu\ at 1500~Å ($4.4 \pm 0.2$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1000~Å and $5.3 \pm 0.5$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1500~Å). The former is the first firm detection of the offset in the range 912 -- 1100 Å while the latter result confirms previous results from \galex, showing that there is little emission from the Solar System from 1400 -- 1800 Å. About half of the offset may be explained by known sources (the integrated light of unresolved galaxies, unresolved stars, emission from ionized gas, and two-photon emission from warm hydrogen in the halo) with the source of the remaining emission as yet unidentified.

Unraveling the kinematic and morphological evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud,"We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (< 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (< 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\circ$ to 82$^\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\Theta$ (~ 180$^\circ$ to 240$^\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.","['S. R. Dhanush', 'A.

Stellar Weak Rates and Mass Fractions of 20 Most Important $fp$-shell Nuclei with $A < 65$,"This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars.

Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK.

Testing the extended corona model with the optical/UV reverberation mapping of the accretion disk,"The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppostthis http URLmost recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups.

An intriguing coincidence between the majority of the VPOS dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position,"A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.","['Istiak Akib', 'François Hammer', 'Yanbin Yang', 'Marcel S.

A metamaterial telescope at millimetre wavelengths,"In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $> 80\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.","['Giorgio Savini', 'Peter Hargrave', 'Peter A.R.

Chapter 15: Open Questions and Future Directions in Titan Science,"In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.","['Conor A.

The Role of Electric Dominance for Particle Injection in Relativistic Reconnection,"Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\sigma\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E>B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection'' stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\zeta(\epsilon^\ast,\epsilon_{\rm T}$) by $E>B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$; here, $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}$; for $\sigma\gtrsim 50$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}/\sigma\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\gtrsim 80\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$ occurs in $E>B$ regions. We find that $\zeta$ is independent of simulation box size $L_x$, as long as $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is normalized to the maximum particle energy, which scales as $\epsilon_{\rm max}\propto L_{\rm x}^{1/2}$ in 2D. The distribution of energy gains $\epsilon_{\chi}$ acquired in $E>B$ regions can be modeled as $dN/d\epsilon_{\chi}\propto\epsilon_{\chi}^{-0.35}\exp[-(\epsilon_{\chi}/0.06\,\sigma)^{0.5}]$. Our results help assess the role of electric dominance in relativistic reconnection with vanishing guide fields, which may be realized in the magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars.","['Sanya Gupta', 'Navin Sridhar', 'Lorenzo Sironi']",13.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00979,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,"['capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares', 'acceleration of particles – plasma astrophysics - magnetic reconnection - nonthermal particle acceleration 1 INTRODUCTION Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas—where the magneti- zation𝜎≫1(defined as the ratio of magnetic enthalpy density to plasma enthalpy density)—is regarded as an efficient particle accel- erator']",2025-01-03
The $z \gtrsim 9$ galaxy UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey: insights into early galaxy evolution and reionization,"The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\mathrm{UV}\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\geq14$ subset of the $z\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.","['Lily Whitler', 'Daniel P.

On the population of electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere of SgrA*,"In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.",['Zaza N.

Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC). VII. Disentangling Mass and Environment Quenching with the Aid of Galaxy-halo Connection in Simulations,"Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the twothis http URLaddress this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\bar{n}_2w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.","['Yun Zheng', 'Kun Xu', 'Donghai Zhao', 'Y.P.

"Detection of ""diffuse"" coronal He I 1083 during the April 8 2024 Solar Eclipse: evidence for terrestrial atmospheric scattering origin","Strong He I 1083 nm atomic line signals have been previously measured during total solar eclipses at coronal heights above the lunar limb. This rather unexpected measurement has kindled a discussion about the hypothesized presence of significant amounts of neutral helium at coronal conditions. We performed spectroscopic observations of the He I 1083 nm spectroscopic region with the newly built CHEESE instrument during the April 8th 2024 total solar eclipse to test the presence of He I 1083 in the solar corona. We detected the He I 1083, the forbidden coronal line Fe XIII 1074.7 nm, as well as the chromospheric H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} line in our eclipse observations. The chromospheric He I 1083 and H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} lines are detected in the corona as well as on the lunar disc. Our findings point toward a non-solar origin of the He I 1083 signal during the April 8th 2024 eclipse that challenge the notion of abundant neutral helium in the solar corona inferred from eclipse observations.","['M.

SpecPT (Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer) Model for Extragalactic Spectroscopy: I. Architecture and Automated Redshift Measurement,"We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 < z < 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.","['Rohan Pattnaik', 'Jeyhan S.

First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar,"We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively.

Probing exoplanetary magnetism via atomic alignment effect,"The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now.

LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7: A Detached White Dwarf-Main-sequence Binary with a Massive White Dwarf Within the Period Gap,"We report the analysis of the detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7, which features a massive white dwarf. Using LAMOST and SDSS spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and radial velocities of both components. SED fitting of photometric data from GALEX, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 yielded the effective temperatures and photometric radii. Eclipsing analysis of high-speed photometric data from the Liverpool Telescope provided orbital inclination, masses, radii, and related physical parameters. The white dwarf in this system has a mass of $1.05 \pm 0.09 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.0090 \pm 0.0008 \, R_\odot$, while the main-sequence star has a mass of $0.299 \pm 0.045 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.286 \pm 0.018 \, R_\odot$. Emission lines observed in the spectra indicate the likely presence of stellar magnetic activity in this system. The relatively cool temperature of the white dwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB) that has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white dwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic variable (dCV) crossing the period gap. We suggest that the system is more likely to be a PCEB, and it is predicted to evolve into a cataclysmic variable and begin mass transfer in approximately 0.27 Gyr.","['Yuji He', 'Hailong Yuan', 'Zhongrui Bai', 'Mingkuan Yang', 'Mengxin Wang', 'Yiqiao Dong', 'Xin Huang', 'Ming Zhou', 'Qian Liu', 'Xiaozhen Yang', 'Ganyu Li', 'Ziyue Jiang', 'Haotong Zhang']",8.0,16.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01171,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) on December 31,,['Cataclysmic variable stars (203)'],2025-01-03
The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation,"We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z<1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.","['Apashanka Das', 'Biswajit Pandey']",15.0,27.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01207,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-03
FEASTS: Radial Distribution of HI surface densities down to 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ of 35 Nearby Galaxies,"We present the HI surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\sim10^{18.1}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.","['Jing Wang', 'Dong Yang', 'Xuchen Lin', 'Qifeng Huang', 'Zhijie Qu', 'Hsiao-Wen Chen', 'Hong Guo', 'Luis C.

Systematic Search for Long-Term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei,"Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\approx$10\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.","['P. Penil', 'A. Domínguez', 'S. Buson', 'M. Ajello', 'S.

Multi-Observatory Study of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): No Evidence For Abnormally Strong Stellar Magnetic Fields After Powerful X-ray Flares,"We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and total surface magnetic flux (Phi), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.","['Konstantin V.

Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.","['Alfredo Micera', 'Daniel Verscharen', 'Jesse T.

Current constraints on cosmological scenarios with very low reheating temperatures,"We present an updated analysis of cosmological models with very low reheating scenarios ($T_\text{RH} \sim \mathcal{O}(\text{MeV})$). Our study includes a more precise computation of neutrino distribution functions, leveraging the latest datasets from cosmological surveys. We perform a joint analysis that combines constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and galaxy surveys, alongside separate investigations of these datasets, carefully assessing the impact of different choices of priors. At the $95\%$ confidence level, we establish a lower bound on the reheating temperature of $T_\text{RH} > 5.96 \; \text{MeV} $, representing the most stringent constraint to date.","['Nicola Barbieri', 'Thejs Brinckmann', 'Stefano Gariazzo', 'Massimiliano Lattanzi', 'Sergio Pastor', 'Ofelia Pisanti']",9.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01369,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-03
A Planet as the Possible Cause of the HD 181327 Debris Disk Asymmetry,"The debris disk around HD 181327 shows a significant asymmetry in its surface brightness profile when viewed in visible light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope STIS instrument show an arc of approximately 90 degrees of higher optical depth at a distance of 84 au from the star. We find that a 2-5 Jupiter-mass planet on a circular orbit at 62 au can produce and maintain a similar feature if the collisional lifetime of dust in the disk is at least 25 kiloyears, and smaller mass planets can produce similar results on longer timescales. We also find that the surface brightness asymmetry is much less pronounced at larger particle sizes, which may account for the fact that observations of HD181327 at longer wavelengths have not reported such an arc. We predict that if a planet is producing the arc in question, the planet is along the line joining the star to the feature, and make some estimates of its observability.","['Chris Fox', 'Paul Wiegert']",9.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01387,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['methods: numerical', 'planets and satellites: detection', 'stars: individual: HD 181327 1 INTRODUCTION HD 181327 (also known as HIP 95270) is an 18']",2025-01-03
The Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM): Validation of a Data Driven Bayesian Simultaneous Component Separation and Calibration Algorithm for EoR Foreground Modelling,"We introduce the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a novel data-driven Bayesian approach to modelling radio foregrounds at frequencies <400~MHz. B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors. This is the first of two papers, and is focused on validation of B-GSMs Bayesian framework, the second paper will present results of deployment on real data and introduce the low-frequency sky model which will be available for public download.","['George Carter', 'Will Handley', 'Mark Ashdown', 'Nima Razavi-Ghods']",8.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01417,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,"Nuclear Physics A 1052, 122941 (2024)","['reionization', 'Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics 1 INTRODUCTION Detection of the cosmological 21cm signal is limited by con- tamination by bright foreground emission that exceeds the expected signal by 3-6 orders of magnitude (Pritchard & Loeb 2012', 'diffuse radiation', 'cosmology: obser- vations', 'methods: statistical', 'Galaxy: general', 'ISM: general']",2025-01-03
Stellar Physics and General Relativity,"The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model.

"Distribution of the H\""ogbom CLEAN Algorithm Using Tiled Images with Feedback","Data sizes for next generation radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), are far above that of their predecessors. The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed by Högbom [1974], long before such data sizes were thought possible and is still the most popular tool used for deconvolution in interferometric imaging. In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and reduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been investigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching pursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of tiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this creates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to deconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated with bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the tiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has been tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known intensity. When compared to a standard Högbom deconvolution the tiled feedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1 Jy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across the whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.","['Daniel Wright', 'Karel Adámek', 'Wesley Armour']",5.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01461,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-06
Sequencing Silicates in the IRS Debris Disk Catalog I: Methodology for Unsupervised Clustering,"Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.","['Cicero X.

A Near-IR Search for Helium in the Superluminous Supernova SN 2024ahr,"We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of $z=0.0861$. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g\approx M_r\approx -21$ mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50$\%$ of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of $\approx 3.3$ ms, a magnetic field strength of $\approx 6\times 10^{13}$ G, and an ejecta mass of $\approx 9.5$ M$_\odot$. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I $\,\lambda 2.058$ $\mu$m feature, and place a conservative upper limit of $\sim 0.05$ M$_\odot$ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I $\,\lambda 1.575$ $\mu$m and a blend of Co II $\,\lambda 2.126$ $\mu$m and Mg II, $\lambda 2.136$ $\mu$m, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I.","['Harsh Kumar', 'Edo Berger', 'Peter K.

Line detections in photospheric radius expansion bursts from 4U 1820-303,"Context: NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) is the instrument of choice for the spectral analysis of type I X-ray bursts, as it provides high throughput at X-ray CCD resolution, down to 0.3 keV. Aims: This study investigates whether the energies of absorption lines detected in photospheric radius expansion (PRE) bursts correlate with the inferred blackbody radius. Previous reports suggested such a correlation, attributed to a combination of weaker gravitational redshift and higher blueshifts in bursts with larger radii. Methods: The analysis reexamines four previously studied PRE bursts and examines eight additional bursts from 4U 1820-303, evidencing PRE. Spectral evolution is tracked on the shortest possible timescales (tenth of a second) adopting two parallel continuum descriptions to characterise the photospheric expansion and line evolution. Applying the accretion-enhanced model, maximum blackbody radii of up to $\sim$ 900 km are inferred, with peak bolometric luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit of an Helium accretor. Absorption lines are assessed for significance using Monte Carlo simulations, and spectral lines are characterised using the state-of-art plasma codes available within {\sc{spex}} with a phenomenological continuum. A thorough parameter search explores Doppler shifts to avoid local minima. Results: Several significant (> 99.9%) absorption lines, including the previously reported 2.97 keV line, are detected. While no consistent correlation between line energies and blackbody radii is confirmed, bursts with larger radii exhibit up to four lines and the line strength is higher. The modelling suggests that the observed lines mostly originate from slightly redshifted (almost rest-frame) photo-/collisionally ionised gas in emission. For the burst with the largest PRE, a combination of photo-ionised plasma in both emission and absorption is preferred.","['F. Barra', 'D. Barret', 'C. Pinto', 'T. Di Salvo', 'N. Weinberg', 'S.

A Link Between White Dwarf Pulsars and Polars: Multiwavelength Observations of the 9.36-Minute Period Variable Gaia22ayj,"White dwarfs (WDs) are the most abundant compact objects, and recent surveys have suggested that over a third of WDs in accreting binaries host a strong (B $\gtrsim$ 1 MG) magnetic field. However, the origin and evolution of WD magnetism remain under debate. Two WD pulsars, AR Sco and J191213.72-441045.1 (J1912), have been found, which are non-accreting binaries hosting rapidly spinning (1.97-min and 5.30-min, respectively) magnetic WDs. The WD in AR Sco is slowing down on a $P/\dot{P}\approx 5.6\times 10^6$ yr timescale. It is believed they will eventually become polars, accreting systems in which a magnetic WD (B $\approx 10-240$ MG) accretes from a Roche lobe-filling donor spinning in sync with the orbit ($\gtrsim 78$ min). Here, we present multiwavelength data and analysis of Gaia22ayj, which outbursted in March 2022. We find that Gaia22ayj is a magnetic accreting WD that is rapidly spinning down ($P/\dot{P} = 6.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times 10^6$ yr) like WD pulsars, but shows clear evidence of accretion, like polars. Strong linear polarization (40%) is detected in Gaia22ayj; such high levels have only been seen in the WD pulsar AR Sco and demonstrate the WD is magnetic. High speed photometry reveals a 9.36-min period accompanying a high amplitude ($\sim 2$ mag) modulation. We associate this with a WD spin or spin-orbit beat period, not an orbital period as was previously suggested. Fast (60-s) optical spectroscopy reveals a broad ``hump'', reminiscent of cyclotron emission in polars, between 4000-8000 Angstrom. We find an X-ray luminosity of $L_X = 2.7_{-0.8}^{+6.2}\times10^{32} \textrm{ erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.3-8 keV energy range, while two VLA radio campaigns resulted in a non-detection with a $F_r < 15.8\mu\textrm{Jy}$ 3$ \sigma$ upper limit. The shared properties of both WD pulsars and polars suggest that Gaia22ayj is a missing link between the two classes of magnetic WD binaries.","['Antonio C.

A 22-Billion Solar Mass Black Hole in Holmberg 15A with Keck KCWI Spectroscopy and Triaxial Orbit Modeling,"Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a ${\sim}100''\times 100''$ contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low amplitude (${\sim}20\mathrm{~km~s}^{-1}$) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over ${\sim}$40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of $p=0.89$ for the middle-to-long principal axes and $q=0.65$ for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, $M_\mathrm{BH}=(2.16^{+0.23}_{-0.18})\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, makes H15A -- along with NGC 4889 -- the galaxies hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean $M_\mathrm{BH}-\sigma$ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases $M_\mathrm{BH}$ to $(2.55\pm 0.20) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, which is still significantly below $M_\mathrm{BH}=(4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.","['Emily R.

Search for continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run,"Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of 45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude is $6.4\!\times\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\!\times\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal.

"ORACLE: A Real-Time, Hierarchical, Deep-Learning Photometric Classifier for the LSST","We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier.

"TOI-421 b: A Hot Sub-Neptune with a Haze-Free, Low Mean Molecular Weight Atmosphere","Common features of sub-Neptunes atmospheres observed to date include signatures of aerosols at moderate equilibrium temperatures (~500-800 K), and a prevalence of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, perhaps indicating novel classes of planets such as water worlds. Here we present a 0.83-5 micron JWST transmission spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-421 b. This planet is unique among previously observed counterparts in its high equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \approx 920$) and its Sun-like host star. We find marked differences between the atmosphere of TOI-421 b and those of sub-Neptunes previously characterized with JWST, which all orbit M stars. Specifically, water features in the NIRISS/SOSS bandpass indicate a low mean molecular weight atmosphere consistent with solar metallicity, and no appreciable aerosol coverage. Hints of SO$_2$ and CO (but not CO$_2$ or CH$_4$) also exist in our NIRSpec/G395M observations, but not at sufficient signal-to-noise to draw firm conclusions. Our results support a picture in which sub-Neptunes hotter than ~850 K do not form hydrocarbon hazes due to a lack of methane to photolyze. TOI-421 b additionally fits the paradigm of the radius valley for planets orbiting FGK stars being sculpted by mass loss processes, which would leave behind primordial atmospheres overlying rock/iron interiors. Further observations of TOI-421 b and similar hot sub-Neptunes will confirm whether haze-free atmospheres and low mean molecular weights are universal characteristics of such objects.","['Brian Davenport', 'Eliza M.-R.

Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background,"The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution. In contrast, the contribution from supermassive BHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals.

Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function -- its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space -- underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov--Poisson simulations, which confirm it.","['Yonadav Barry Ginat', 'Michael L. Nastac', 'Robert J.

An Integral Field Unit for the Binospec Spectrograph,"Binospec is a wide-field optical (360 to 1000 nm) spectrograph commissioned at the MMT 6.5m telescope in 2017. In direct imaging mode Binospec addresses twin 8$^\prime$ (wide) by 15$^\prime$ (slit length) fields of view. We describe an optical fiber based integral field unit (IFU) that remaps a 12$^{\prime\prime}$ x 16$^{\prime\prime}$ contiguous region onto two pseudo slits, one in each Binospec channel. The IFU, commissioned in 2023, fits into the space of a standard slit mask frame and can be deployed as desired in a mixed program of slit masks, long slits, and IFU observations. The IFU fibers are illuminated by a hexagonal lenslet array with a 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ pitch. A separate bundle of sky fibers consists of close-packed bare fibers arranged within an 11.8$^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. The 640 IFU fibers and 80 sky fibers have a core diameter of 150$\mu$m, corresponding to 0.90$^{\prime\prime}$.

SN 2018is: a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova with narrow hydrogen emission lines at early phases,"We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the Type IIP SN 2018is. The $V$-band luminosity and the expansion velocity at 50 days post-explosion are $-$15.1$\pm$0.2 mag (corrected for A$_V$=1.34 mag) and 1400 km s$^{-1}$, classifying it as a low-luminosity SN II. The recombination phase in the $V$-band is shorter, lasting around 110 days, and exhibits a steeper decline (1.0 mag per 100 days) compared to most other low-luminosity SNe II. Additionally, the optical and near-infrared spectra display hydrogen emission lines that are strikingly narrow, even for this class. The Fe II and Sc II line velocities are at the lower end of the typical range for low-luminosity SNe II. Semi-analytical modelling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $\sim$8 M$_\odot$, corresponding to a pre-supernova mass of $\sim$9.5 M$_\odot$, and an explosion energy of $\sim$0.40 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. Hydrodynamical modelling further indicates that the progenitor had a zero-age main sequence mass of 9 M$_\odot$, coupled with a low explosion energy of 0.19 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. The nebular spectrum reveals weak [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 lines, consistent with a moderate-mass progenitor, while features typical of Fe core-collapse events, such as He I, [C I], and [Fe I], are indiscernible. However, the redder colours and low ratio of Ni to Fe abundance do not support an electron-capture scenario either. As a low-luminosity SN II with an atypically steep decline during the photospheric phase and remarkably narrow emission lines, SN 2018is contributes to the diversity observed within this population.","['R.

Compton Scattering of Thermal Disk Radiation with Black Hole Disk Winds,"Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries are known to exhibit episodic outbursts, during which accretion and spectral mode distinctively transition between low/hard and high/soft state. X-ray observations during high/soft state occasionally reveal a pronounced presence of a powerful disk wind in these systems. However, it is unexplored to date how such winds may influence disk emission in that regime.In this work, we consider an observational implication by Compton scattering of thermal disk radiation due to accretion disk winds by performing multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations in the context of a stratified wind of large solid angle launched over a large radial extent of the disk. Compton-scattered thermal disk spectrum is computed for a different wind property; i.e. wind density and its radial gradient. We find that the intrinsic disk radiation can be significantly down-scattered by winds of moderate-to-high density to the extent that the transmitted spectrum can substantially deviate from the conventional multi-color-disk emission by factor of up to 70\%. We thus claim that the conventional treatment of spectral hardening in the disk atmosphere may be insufficient to fully account for the observed disk continuum in the presence of strong wind scattering.It is suggested that the effect of scattering process (by $f_w$) should be incorporated to accurately evaluate an intrinsic disk spectrum besides the conventional hardening (color correction) factor (by $f_c$). We argue that BH spin measurements using thermal continuum-fitting in transient XRBs may well be mildly (if not significantly) altered by such spectral ``contamination"".",['Keigo Fukumura'],49.0,39.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01532,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Accretion (14) — Computational methods (1965) — Low-mass x-ray binary stars (939) — Stellar mass black holes (1611) — X-ray transient sources (1852) — Black hole physics (159) — Spectroscopy (1558) — Astrophysical black holes(98) — X-ray astronomy(1810)'],2025-01-06
"Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics","For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 < H_r < 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.","['Pedro H. Bernardinelli', 'Gary M.

Jewel Optics I: non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the guilt,"The enduring technique of aperture masking interferometry, now more than 150 years old, is still widely practised today for it opens a window of high angular resolution astronomy that remains difficult to access by any competing technology. However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant array dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\sim$10\% or less. This in turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to only bright science targets. This paper presents ""Jewel Optics"", a novel technology that leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional aperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of sparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique phase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all individual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area of the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts light from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector. We demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the Subaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab results. We discuss a design refinement for producing fully achromatic Jewel Optics, and finally we highlight the potential for future work with these novel optical components.","['Adam K.

Microlensing of lensed supernovae Zwicky & iPTF16geu: constraints on the lens galaxy mass slope and dark compact object fraction,"To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} < 0.47$ for SN Zwicky. Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.","['Nikki Arendse', 'Edvard Mörtsell', 'Luke Weisenbach', 'Erin Hayes', 'Stephen Thorp', 'Suhail Dhawan', 'Ariel Goobar', 'Sacha Guerrini', 'Jacob Osman Hjortlund', 'Joel Johansson', 'Cameron Lemon']",12.0,19.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01578,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-06
Millihertz Oscillations Near the Innermost Orbit of a Supermassive Black Hole,"Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to mHz frequency gravitational wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant mHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, UV, and X-ray outburst beginning in 2018. The QPO was first detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on scales of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical QPEs. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over two years with a decelerating period evolution ($\ddot{P} > 0$). This evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular momentum losses, while the lack of a direct analog to stellar mass black hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational wave emission.","['Megan Masterson', 'Erin Kara', 'Christos Panagiotou', 'William N.

Fire and Ice in the Whirlpool: Spatially Resolved Scaling Relations between X-ray Emitting Hot Gas and Cold Molecular Gas in M51,"The cold and hot interstellar medium (ISM) in star forming galaxies resembles the reservoir for star formation and associated heating by stellar winds and explosions during stellar evolution, respectively. We utilize data from deep $Chandra$ observations and archival millimeter surveys to study the interconnection between these two phases and the relation to star formation activities in M51 on kiloparsec scales. A sharp radial decrease is present in the hot gas surface brightness profile within the inner 2 kpc of M51. The ratio between the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and the hot gas luminosity ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a positive correlation with the galactic radius in the central region. For the entire galaxy, a twofold correlation is revealed in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ diagram, where $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ sharply increases with $L_{\rm IR}$ in the center but varies more slowly in the disk. The best fit gives a steep relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.82\,{\rm log}(L_{\rm IR} /{L_{\rm \odot}})+22.26$ for the center of M51. The similar twofold correlations are also found in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$molecular line luminosity ($L^\prime_{\rm gas}$) relations for the four molecular emission lines CO(1-0), CO(2-1), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We demonstrate that the core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are the primary source of energy for heating gas in the galactic center of M51, leading to the observed steep $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L^\prime_{\rm gas}$ relations, as their X-ray radiation efficiencies ($\eta$ $\equiv$ $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$/$\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$) increase with the star formation rate surface densities, where $\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$ is the SN mechanical energy input rate.","['Chunyi Zhang', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Tian-Wen Cao']",6.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01613,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: hot ISM — galaxies: individual (M51) — galaxies: molecules — galaxies: infrared 1'],2025-01-06
Photometric Determination of Unresolved Main-sequence Binaries in the Pleiades: Binary Fraction and Mass Ratio Distribution,"Accurate determination of binary fractions ($f_{\rm b}$) and mass ratio ($q$) distributions is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the analysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric determination of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable mass ratio can be down to the $q_{\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar mass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes of Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the Pleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member, deriving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass ($\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS) single stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the Pleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary properties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \pm 0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This distribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an exponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 < q < 0.8$, but with a deficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary distribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of primordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the observational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\rm lim} (\mathcal{M}_1)$.","['Rongrong Liu', 'Zhengyi Shao', 'Lu Li']",14.0,21.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01617,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],AJ,,['Open star clusters (1160) —Binary stars (154) — Mass ratio (1012) — Bayesian statistics (1900) 1'],2025-01-06
Cosmological constraints from the Minkowski functionals of the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample,"For the first time, we develop a simulation-based model for the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of large-scale structure, which allows us to extract the full information available from the MFs (including both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian part), and apply it to the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. Our model is based on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the \textsc{Abacus}\textsc{Summit} simulations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which include the redshift-space distortions and Alcock-Paczynski distortions, incorporate survey realism, including survey geometry and veto masks, and account for angular plus radial selection effects. The cosmological and HOD parameter dependence of the MFs is captured with a neural network emulator trained from the galaxy mocks with various cosmological and HOD parameters. To benchmark the constraining power of the MFs, we also train an emulator for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) using the same pipeline. Having validated our approach through successful parameter recovery tests on both internal and external mocks, including non-HOD forward models of the halo-galaxy connection, we apply our forward model to analyze the CMASS data in the redshift range $0.45<z<0.58$. We find the MFs provide stronger constraints on the cosmological parameters than the 2PCF. The combination of the two gives $\omega_{\rm cdm}=0.1172^{+0.0020}_{-0.0023}$, $\sigma_8=0.783\pm 0.026$, and $n_s=0.966^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$, which are tighter by a factor of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6 than the 2PCF alone. The derived constraint $f\sigma_8=0.453 \pm 0.016$ is also improved by a factor of 1.9, compared to the 2PCF, and agrees well with Planck 2018 predictions and other results from a series of studies in the literature.","['Wei Liu', 'Enrique Paillas', 'Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro', 'Georgios Valogiannis', 'Wenjuan Fang']",15.0,51.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01698,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-06

Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids,"Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories.

The ESO SupJup Survey IV. Unveiling the carbon isotope ratio of GQ Lup B and its host star,"The carbon isotope ratio ($^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$) is a potential tracer of giant planet and brown dwarf formation. The GQ Lup system, hosting the K7 T Tauri star GQ Lup A and its substellar companion GQ Lup B, offers a unique opportunity to investigate this ratio in a young system. We aim to characterise the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, determining its temperature, chemical composition, spin, surface gravity, and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$, while also measuring the same ratio for its host star, GQ Lup A. High-resolution K-band spectra of GQ Lup were obtained using CRIRES+ at the VLT. We modelled the starlight contribution from GQ Lup A and fitted GQ Lup Bś spectrum with atmospheric models from petitRADTRANS. The $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio for GQ Lup A was derived using isotope-sensitive PHOENIX models. Atmospheric analysis of GQ Lup B revealed abundances of H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, along with a C/O ratio of $0.50 \pm 0.01$, consistent with the solar value. The carbon isotope ratio was measured as $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 53^{+7}_{-6}$ for GQ Lup B and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 51^{+10}_{-8}$ for GQ Lup A. Strong veiling of the photospheric lines of GQ Lup A was identified and accounted for. The similar $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ values in GQ Lup A and B suggest a common origin from a shared material reservoir, supporting formation via disc fragmentation or gravitational collapse.","['D.

AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1,"A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.","['Jingbo Sun', 'Hengxiao Guo', 'Minfeng Gu', 'Ya-Ping Li', 'Yongjun Chen', 'D.

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) and its prototype phases,"Multi-messenger astronomy is key today to broaden our understanding of the high energy Universe. When an ultra-high energy (UHE) particle interacts in the atmosphere or underground, it initiates an extensive air shower that produces a coherent radio emission in the 50-200 MHz range. The GRAND project is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles (cosmic rays, gamma rays and especially neutrinos) that will consist of 200,000 radio antennas deployed over 20 different locations each of $\sim$ 10,000 $\rm km^2$. In its current phase, it consists of 3 prototypes running autonomously in 3 different locations: GRAND@Auger in Argentina, GRAND@Nançay in France and GRANDProto300 in China, all at commissioning stage. The first goal of these pathfinders is to demonstrate the viability of the GRAND detection concept. GRANDProto300 will also propose a rich science case, by allowing the study of the transition between galactic and extra-galactic cosmic ray sources. In the following, we present the detection concept, the preliminary designs and layout and the ongoing developments of the experiment.",['Marion Guelfand'],2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01851,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],Proceedings of the VHEPU Session - Conference Rencontres de Moriond 2024,,[],2025-01-06
A review of long lasting activities of the central engine of gamma-ray bursts,"Gamma-ray bursts are known to display various features on top of their canonical behavior. In this short review, we will describe and discuss two of them: the ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, which are defined by an extreme duration of their prompt phase, and the plateau phase, which is defined by a steady phase of large duration at the start of the afterglow. We will review the main properties of those two phenomena, and will discuss their possible origin, in light of the standard fireball model of gamma-ray bursts. A final section will discuss the future missions which could bring new evidences to the study of those objects.",['Bruce Gendre'],3.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01857,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-Ray Bursts'],2025-01-06
Glitches and glitching clusters in rotation-powered pulsars,"The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.","['Pei-Xin Zhu', 'Xiao-Ping Zheng']",8.0,17.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01862,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,"The Astrophysical Journal, 978:49 (13pp), 2025 January 01",['pulsars: general – stars: neutron – methods: statistical 1'],2025-01-06
Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges,"Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.","['J.S. Castellanos Durán', 'A.

Early steep optical decay linked to reverse shock for GRB200131A,"We observed an optical afterglow of GRB 200131A obtaining the first photometric point 63 s after the satellite trigger. This early observation shows a steep decay, suggesting either internal engine activity or a reverse shock. By fitting this data set, we show that the early data fit well as a reverse shock component of the GRB afterglow modeled as a thin shell expanding into a constant density interstellar matter. The fitting also shows a good agreement with a catalogued Milky Way galactic extinction and leaves only little space for further extinction in the host galaxy. By judging several factors we conclude that the most likely redshift of this GRB is 0.9 +/- 0.1.","['Martin Jelínek', 'Filip Novotný', 'Sylvio Klose', 'Bringfried Stecklum', 'Alžběta Maleňáková', 'Jan Štrobl']",4.0,6.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01893,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['photometry', 'Gamma-ray bursts']",2025-01-06
Very high energy cosmic ray particles from the Kerr black hole at the galaxy center,"Conventional general relativity supplies the notion of a vacuum tension and thus a maximum force $F_{max}=c^4/4G\approx\ 3\times 10^{43}$ Newtons, that is realized for a black hole.

H$\alpha$-X-ray Surface Brightness Correlation for Filaments in Cooling Flow Clusters,"Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($<$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.","['Valeria Olivares', 'Adrien Picquenot', 'Yuanyuan Su', 'Massimo Gaspari', 'Marie-Lou Gendron-Marsolais', 'Fiorella L.

Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723,"We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 44{,}800 \pm 1200$, surface gravity $\log g = 4.89 \pm 0.18$, and helium abundance $\log N({\rm He})/N({\rm H}) = -0.84 \pm 0.29$) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically-derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's RGB stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N V $\lambda 1240$ doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass ($\sim 1.2 \, M_{\odot}$) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.",['William V.

Exoplanet Detection via Differentiable Rendering,"Direct imaging of exoplanets is crucial for advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system, but it faces significant challenges due to the high contrast between host stars and their planets. Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits. Our results showcase how the computational advancements enabled by differentiable rendering can revitalize previously underexploited wavefront data, opening new avenues for enhancing exoplanet imaging and characterization.","['Brandon Y.

Lyman-alpha resonant-line radiative transfer in expanding media,"The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information about both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming regions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our work complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about nonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future subgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.","['Aaron Smith', 'Kevin Lorinc', 'Olof Nebrin', 'Bing-Xin Lao']",15.0,19.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01928,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['Line: profiles – radiative transfer – methods: analytical – methods: numerical 1 INTRODUCTION The Lyman 𝛼(Ly𝛼) transition of neutral hydrogen is a powerful probeofthephysicalconditionsanddynamicalprocessesingalaxies across cosmic time (Partridge & Peebles 1967)'],2025-01-06
Identification of the interstellar 1-cyano propargyl radical (HCCCHCN) in TMC-1,"We report the first detection in interstellar medium of the 1-cyano propargyl radical, HC$_3$HCN. This species is an isomer of the 3-cyano propargyl radical (CH$_2$C$_3$N), which was recently discovered in TMC-1. The 1-cyano propargyl radical was observed in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey, which is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. A total of seven rotational transitions with multiple hyperfine components were detected in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range. We derived a column density of (2.2$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of 7$\pm$1\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$HCN and CH$_2$C$_3$N is 1.4. The almost equal abundance of these isomers indicates that the two species may be produced in the same reaction with a similar efficiency, probably in the reaction C + CH$_2$CHCN and perhaps also in the reaction C$_2$ + CH$_3$CN and the dissociative recombination with electrons of CH$_2$C$_3$NH$^+$","['C.

Hybrid-z: Enhancing Kilo-Degree Survey bright galaxy sample photometric redshifts with deep learning,"We employ deep learning (DL) to improve photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 Bright galaxy sample (KiDS-Bright DR4). This dataset, used as a foreground for KiDS lensing and clustering studies, is flux-limited to $r<20$ mag with mean $z=0.23$ and covers 1000 deg$^2$. Its photo-$z$s were previously derived with artificial neural networks from the ANNz2 package, trained on the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopy. Here we considerably improve over these previous redshift estimations by building a DL model, Hybrid-z, which combines four-band KiDS images with nine-band magnitudes from KiDS+VIKING. The Hybrid-z framework provides photo-$z$s for KiDS-Bright, with negligible mean residuals of O($10^{-4}$) and scatter at the level of $0.014(1+z)$ -- reduction by 20% over the previous nine-band derivations with ANNz2. We check our photo-$z$ model performance on test data drawn from GAMA, as well as from other KiDS-overlapping wide-angle spectroscopic surveys, namely SDSS, 2dFLenS, and 2dFGRS. We find stable behavior and consistent improvement over ANNz2 throughout. We finally apply Hybrid-z trained on GAMA to the entire KiDS-Bright DR4 sample of 1.2 million galaxies. For these final predictions, we design a method of smoothing the input redshift distribution of the training set, to avoid propagation of features present in GAMA, related to its small sky area and large-scale structure imprint in its fields. Our work paves the way towards the best-possible photo-$z$s achievable with machine learning for any galaxy type both for the final KiDS-Bright DR5 data and for future deeper imaging, such as from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.","['Anjitha John William', 'Priyanka Jalan', 'Maciej Bilicki', 'Wojciech A.

Dwarf Galaxies in the TNG50 Field: connecting their Star-formation Rates with their Environments,"The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 <{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})<9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. The way this phenomenon results from the dwarfs' halo properties or their locations in the large-scale structure is not well understood. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the Illustris TNG50 simulation across different environments, focusing on the dwarfs having host halos with virial masses $9 < {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) < 11.5$, which we demonstrate are in the field as opposed to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We quantify the field dwarfs' large-scale environmental using the tidal index $\Theta_1$ and the distance to the nearest massive galaxy ${\rm d_{massive}}$, and we study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories are correlated with these metrics. Those with ${\rm d_{massive}}>1.5$ Mpc and $\Theta_1<0$ are well isolated, with only $\sim 1\%$ being quenched. The quenched field dwarfs are in majority the backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and pre-processed dwarfs in denser environments.","['Joy Bhattacharyya', 'Annika H.

Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-Rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563,"We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 years of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8-months-long event in 2023 that caused a >40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. TESS photometry suggests a coherent 14.842-hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances.

Abundant Water from Early Supernovae at Cosmic Dawn,"Primordial (or Pop III) supernovae were the first nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the heavy elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Water, in particular, is thought to be crucial to the cosmic origins of life as we understand it, and recent models have shown that water can form in low-metallicity gas like that present at high redshifts. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the first water in the Universe formed in Pop III core-collapse and pair-instability supernovae at redshifts $z \sim$ 20. The primary sites of water production in these remnants are dense molecular cloud cores, which in some cases were enriched with primordial water to mass fractions that were only a factor of a few below those in the Solar System today. These dense, dusty cores are also likely candidates for protoplanetary disk formation. Besides revealing that a primary ingredient for life was already in place in the Universe 100 - 200 Myr after the Big Bang, our simulations show that water was likely a key constituent of the first galaxies.","['Daniel J.

"The SLACS strong lens sample, debiased. II. Lensing-only constraints on the stellar IMF and dark matter contraction in early-type galaxies","The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) is the best studied sample of strong lenses to date. Much of our knowledge of the SLACS lenses has been obtained by combining strong lensing with stellar kinematics constraints. However, interpreting stellar kinematics data is difficult: it requires reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a galaxy and the orbits of its stars. In this work we pursued an alternative approach to the study of galaxy structure with SLACS, based purely on gravitational lensing data. The primary goal of this study is to constrain the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter $\alpha_{sps}$, quantifying the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and that obtained with a reference stellar population synthesis model, and the efficiency of the dark matter response to the infall of baryons, $\epsilon$. We combined Einstein radius measurements from the SLACS lenses with weak lensing information from their parent sample, while accounting for selection effects. The data can be fit comparatively well by a model with $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0.22$ and $\epsilon=0$, corresponding to an IMF slightly lighter than Salpeter and no dark matter contraction, or $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0$ and $\epsilon=0.8$, equivalent to a Chabrier IMF and almost maximal contraction. This degeneracy could be broken with lensing-only measurements of the projected density slope, but existing data are completely inconsistent with our model. We suspect systematic errors in the measurements to be at the origin of this discrepancy. Number density constraints would also help break the degeneracy. Because of selection effects, SLACS lenses have a larger velocity dispersion than galaxies with the same projected mass distribution, and their velocity dispersion is overestimated. These two biases combined produce a $5\%$ upward shift in the observed velocity dispersion.",['Alessandro Sonnenfeld'],11.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02054,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,"['Gravitational lensing: strong - Galaxies: elliptical and lenticular', 'cD - Galaxies: fundamental parameters 1']",2025-01-07
Upper Limits on the Mass of Cool Gas in the CGM of Dwarf Galaxies,"We use HI absorption measurements to constrain the amount of cool ($\approx 10^4$ K), photoionized gas in the CGM of dwarf galaxies with $M_* = 10^{6.5-9.5}~M_\odot$ in the nearby Universe ($z<0.3$). We show analytically that volume-filling gas gives an upper limit on the gas mass needed to reproduce a given HI column density profile. We introduce a power-law density profile for the gas distribution and fit our model to archival HI observations to infer the cool CGM gas mass, $M_{\rm cCGM}$, as a function of halo mass. For volume-filling ($f_V=1$) models, we find $M_{\rm cCGM} = 5 \times 10^8-2 \times 10^9~M_\odot$, constituting $\lesssim 10\%$ of the halo baryon budget. For clumpy gas, with $f_V=0.01$, the masses are a factor of $\approx 11$ lower, in agreement with our analytic approximation. Our assumption that the measured HI forms entirely in the cool CGM provides a conservative upper limit on $M_{\rm cCGM}$, and possible contributions from the IGM or warm/hot CGM will further strengthen our result. We estimate the mass uncertainties due to the range of redshifts in our sample and the unknown gas metallicity to be $\approx 15\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. Our results show that dwarf galaxies have only $\lesssim 15\%$ of their baryon budget in stars and the cool CGM, with the rest residing in the warm/hot CGM or ejected from the dark matter halos.","['Yakov Faerman', 'Yong Zheng', 'Benjamin D.

Revisiting the Group-Dominant Elliptical NGC 5044 in the Radio Band: Continuum Emission and Detection of HI Absorption,"We present new MeerKAT L-band (continuum and HI) and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (300-850 MHz) observations of the archetypal cool-core group-dominant early-type galaxy NGC 5044. Our new continuum images reveal diffuse, steep spectrum ($\alpha_{0.99\,\rm GHz}^{1.56\,\rm GHz}=-1.53\pm0.6$) radio emission extending about 25 kpc around the unresolved radio core. The observed radio emission overlaps with the known X-ray cavities, but is not confined to them. We also find the first direct evidence of neutral atomic gas in NGC 5044, in the form of a 3.8$\sigma$ significant two-component HI absorption line seen against the emission of the active nucleus. The peak velocities are well correlated with the previously reported CO(2-1) absorption, but the HI lines are moderately broader, spanning velocities from $265\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$ to $305\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$. We do not detect HI emission, but place an upper limit of $M_{HI}< 5.4 \times 10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$ in the central 15 arcsec (2.2 kpc) of the galaxy. This is significantly less than the estimated molecular gas content, and implies a molecular-to-atomic mass ratio of $\geq $1.7:1, consistent with these gas phases forming through cooling from the hot intra-group medium. We also constrain the spin temperature to $T_{\rm spin}\leq 950\,\rm K$, indicating that the detected HI is in the cold neutral phase.","['Kamlesh Rajpurohit', 'Tirna Deb', 'Konstantinos Kolokythas', 'Kshitij Thorat', ""Ewan O'Sullivan"", 'Gerrit Schellenberger', 'Laurence P.

Statistical trends in JWST transiting exoplanet atmospheres,"Our brains are hardwired for pattern recognition as correlations are useful for predicting and understanding nature.

Here we present a framework for comparing exoplanet transmission spectroscopy from 3 to 5$\mu$m with four bands: L (2.9 - 3.7$\mu$m), SO$_2$ (3.95 - 4.1$\mu$m), CO$_2$ (4.25 - 4.4$\mu$m) and CO (4.5 - 4.9$\mu$m). Together, the four bands cover the major carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-bearing molecules including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and CO. Among the eight high-precision gas giant exoplanet planet spectra we collected, we found strong correlations between the SO$_2$-L index and planet mass (r=-0.41$\pm$0.09) and temperature (r=-0.64$\pm$0.08), indicating SO$_2$ preferably exists (SO$_2$-L$>$-0.5) among low mass ($\sim<$0.3M$_J$) and cooler ($\sim<$1200K) targets. We also observe strong temperature dependency for both CO$_2$-L and CO-L indices. Under equilibrium chemistry and isothermal thermal structure assumptions, we find that the planet sample favors super-solar metallicity and low C/O ratio ($<$0.7). In addition, the presence of a mass-metallicity correlation is favored over uniform metallicity with the eight planets. We further introduce the SO$_2$-L versus CO$_2$-L diagram alike the color-magnitude diagram for stars and brown dwarfs. All reported trends here will be testable and be further quantified with existing and future JWST observations within the next few years.","['Guangwei Fu', 'Kevin B. Stevenson', 'David K.

Retracing the Cold Plasma Dispersion Law in Pulsar B0329+54: New Insights into Frequency-Dependent Dispersion Measures,"Multiple studies have investigated potential frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DM) in PSR B0329+54, with sensitivities at levels of $10^{-3} \, \text{pc} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ or higher, using frequencies below 1 GHz. Utilizing the extensive bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, we conducted simultaneous observations of this pulsar across a frequency range of 300 to 1460 MHz. Our observations reveal a distinct point in the pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with the cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the entire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival (ToAs) from widely adopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT)-leads to frequency-dependent DMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in this pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry corresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in the range 300-1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the dipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is centered at $\sim$800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the size of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given frequencies, and it is at least five times more stringent than the existing emission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.","['Shyam S.

JOYS: The [D/H] abundance derived from protostellar outflows across the Galactic disk measured with JWST,"The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]$=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.","['L. Francis', 'E. F. van Dishoeck', 'A.

Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Transients,"Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. When calculating the properties of the images we expect to see from these lenses, it is typically assumed that each lens is roughly a singular isothermal sphere. In reality, the largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. Focusing on gravitational waves, we compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, as seen elsewhere in the literature. This significant deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of lenses through time domain transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.","['Luka Vujeva', 'Jose María Ezquiaga', 'Rico K.

"Using LSDB to enable large-scale catalog distribution, cross-matching, and analytics","The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate an unprecedented volume of data, including approximately 60 petabytes of raw data and around 30 trillion observed sources, posing a significant challenge for large-scale and end-user scientific analysis. As part of the LINCC Frameworks Project we are addressing these challenges with the development of the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and analysis package LSDB (Large Scale Database). HATS partitions data adaptively using a hierarchical tiling system to balance the file sizes, enabling efficient parallel analysis. Recent updates include improved metadata consistency, support for incremental updates, and enhanced compatibility with evolving datasets. LSDB complements HATS by providing a scalable, user-friendly interface for large catalog analysis, integrating spatial queries, crossmatching, and time-series tools while utilizing Dask for parallelization. We have successfully demonstrated the use of these tools with datasets such as ZTF and Pan-STARRS data releases on both cluster and cloud environments.

Cross validation of albedo determination for 1627 Ivar from three different techniques,"Near Earth Asteroids are of great interest to the scientific community due to their proximity to Earth, making them both potential hazards and possible targets for future missions, as they are relatively easy to reach by spacecraft. A number of techniques and models can be used to constrain their physical parameters and build a comprehensive assessment of these objects. In this work, we compare physical property results obtained from improved $H_V$ absolute magnitude values, thermophysical modeling, and polarimetry data for the well-known Amor-class NEO 1627 Ivar. We show that our fits for albedo are consistent with each other, thus demonstrating the validity of this cross-referencing approach, and propose a value for Ivar's albedo of $0.24^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ . Future observations will extend this work to a larger sample size, increasing the reliability of polarimetry for rapid asteroid property characterization, as a technique independent of previously established methods and requiring significantly fewer observations.","['Elena Selmi', 'M.

The Lack of RR Lyrae Variables in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Sextans II,"RR Lyrae in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, if found, would be valuable to constrain the distances of these UFD. In this work, we report our search of RR Lyrae in a recently discovered UFD -- Sextans II. Based on multiband ($griz$) time-series archival DECam imaging data, we do not find any RR Lyrae in Sextans II. On the contrary, the sparse multiband DECam light curves allowed recovery of a known foreground RR Lyrae, BB Sex, which happened to fall within the DECam images, and its pulsation period was correctly identified. Therefore, it is possible that Sextans II lacks RR Lyrae, similar to several other fainter UFDs (with $M_V \gtrsim -5.0$~mag) that do not have RR Lyrae.","['Chow-Choong Ngeow', 'Anupam Bhardwaj']",7.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02160,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,[],2025-01-07
Differentiating the acceleration mechanisms in the slow and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind,"In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second, and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface, before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly than a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfvén wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfvénicity that suggest Alfvén waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfvénic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds Alfvénic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfvénic slow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below Parker's orbit.","['Yeimy J.

ALMA 0.1 pc View of Molecular Clouds Associated with High-Mass Protostellar Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Are Low-Metallicity Clouds Filamentary or Not?,"Filamentary molecular clouds are an essential intermediate stage in the star formation process. To test whether these structures are universal throughout cosmic star formation history, it is crucial to study low-metallicity environments within the Local Group. We present an ALMA analysis of the ALMA archival data at the spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc for 17 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z $\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$). This sample represents approximately 30% of the YSOs confirmed by Spitzer spectroscopy. Early ALMA studies of the SMC have shown that the CO emission line traces an H$_2$ number density of $\gtrsim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, an order of magnitude higher than in the typical Galactic environments. Using the CO($J$ = 3-2) data, we investigated the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular clouds. Our analysis shows that about 60% of the clouds have steep radial profiles from the spine of the elongated structures, while the remaining clouds have a smooth distribution and are characterized by lower brightness temperatures. We categorized the former as filaments and the latter as non-filaments. Some of the filamentary clouds are associated with YSOs with outflows and exhibit higher temperatures, likely reflecting their formation conditions, suggesting that these clouds are younger than non-filamentary ones. This indicates that even if filaments form during star formation, their steep structures may become less prominent and transit to a lower-temperature state. Such transitions in structure and temperature have not been reported in metal-rich regions, highlighting a key behavior for characterizing the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation in low-metallicity environments.","['Kazuki Tokuda', 'Yuri Kunitoshi', 'Sarolta Zahorecz', 'Kei E.

"MOA-2022-BLG-033Lb, KMT-2023-BLG-0119Lb, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896Lb: Three low mass-ratio microlensing planets detected through dip signals","We examined the anomalies in the light curves of the lensing events MOA-2022-BLG-033, KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896. We conducted detailed modeling of the light curves to uncover the nature of the anomalies. This modeling revealed that all signals originated from planetary companions to the primary lens. The planet-to-host mass ratios are very low: $q\sim 7.5\times 10^{-5}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-033, $q\sim 3.6\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and $q\sim 6.9\times 10^{-5}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-1896. The anomalies occurred as the source passed through the negative deviation region behind the central caustic along the planet-host axis. The solutions are subject to a common inner-outer degeneracy, resulting in variations in estimating the projected planet-host separation. For KMT-2023-BLG-1896, although the planetary scenario provides the best explanation of the anomaly, the binary companion scenario is marginally possible. We estimate the physical parameters of the planetary systems through Bayesian analyses based on the lensing observables. The analysis identifies MOA-2022-BLG-033L as a planetary system with an ice giant, approximately 12 times the mass of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-1896L is also an ice giant, with a mass around 16 Earth masses, orbiting a mid-K-type main-sequence star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-0119L, which has a mass about the mass of Saturn, orbits a mid-K-type dwarf star. The lens for MOA-2022-BLG-033 is highly likely to be located in the disk, whereas for the other events, the probabilities of the lens being in the disk or the bulge are roughly comparable.","['Cheongho Han', 'Ian A.

A Critical Reanalysis of Supernova Type Ia Data,"Cosmological parameter fitting remains crucial, especially with the abundance of available data. While many parameters have been tightly constrained, discrepancies-most notably the Hubble tension-persist between measurements obtained from different observational datasets. In this paper, we re-examine the Pantheon supernova dataset to explore deviations in the distribution of distance modulus residuals from the Gaussian distribution, which is typically the underlying assumption. We do this analysis for the concordant cosmological constant model and for a variety of dynamical dark energy models. It has been shown earlier that the residuals in this dataset are better fit to a logistic distribution. We compare the residual distributions assuming both Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods on the complete dataset, as well as various subsets of the data. The results, validated through various statistical tests, demonstrate that the Logistic likelihood provides a better fit for the full dataset and lower redshift bins, while higher redshift bins fit Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods similarly. Furthermore, the findings indicate a preference for a cosmological constant model. However analysing individual surveys within the Pantheon dataset reveals inconsistencies among subsets. The level of agreement between surveys varies depending upon the underlying likelihood function.","['Ramanpreet Singh', 'Athul C N', 'H.K.

"A Comprehensive Catalog of Emission-line Nebulae, Star Clusters, and Supergiants in M31 from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey","Spectroscopic observations of various tracers in nearby galaxies, such as Andromeda (M31), play a crucial role in identifying and classifying individual stellar populations and nebular objects, thereby enhancing our understanding of galactic composition, environment, and dynamics as well as stellar evolution. While the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope) survey of M31 has produced extensive datasets, a comprehensive catalog of emission-line nebulae, star clusters, and supergiants is yet to be completed. In this paper, we present a final catalog of 384 emission-line nebulae, 380 star clusters, and 375 supergiants and candidates in M31, as carefully selected and identified from the LAMOST spectroscopic database. These objects were classified using a random forest algorithm, followed by thorough visual examinations of their spectral characteristics as well as morphologies revealed by archive images. For emission-line nebulae, we measured radial velocities and relative fluxes of emission lines, enabling further classification of planetary nebulae and HII regions. Additionally, we identified 245 emission-line nebulae in M33.

Planetary Edge Trends (PET). I. The Inner Edge-Stellar Mass Correlation,"The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.","['Meng-Fei Sun', 'Ji-Wei Xie', 'Ji-Lin Zhou', 'Beibei Liu', 'Nikolaos Nikolaou', 'Sarah C.

Tracking Star-Forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles,"Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars, and the impact of turbulence, is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2, 10$. Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2$ model. In the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.","['Shingo Nozaki', 'Hajime Fukushima', 'Kazuki Tokuda', 'Masahiro N.

Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical,"The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.","['Sanket Wavhal', 'Pawan Kumar', 'Bidya Binay Karak']",8.0,20.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02262,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,['Solar dynamo'],2025-01-07
TOI-6038 A b: A dense sub-Saturn in the transition regime between the Neptunian ridge and savanna,"We present the discovery and characterization of a sub-Saturn exoplanet, TOI-6038~A~b, using the PARAS-2 spectrograph. The planet orbits a bright ($m_V=9.9$), metal-rich late F-type star, TOI-6038~A, with $T_{\rm{eff}}=6110\pm100~\mathrm{K}$, $\log{g}=4.118^{+0.015}_{-0.025}$, and $[{\rm{Fe/H}}]=0.124^{+0.079}_{-0.077}$ dex. The system also contains a wide-orbit binary companion, TOI-6038~B, an early K-type star at a projected separation of $\approx3217$ AU. We combined radial velocity data from PARAS-2 with photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for joint modeling. TOI-6038~A~b has a mass of $78.5^{+9.5}_{-9.9}~M_\oplus$ and a radius of $6.41^{+0.20}_{-0.16}~R_\oplus$, orbiting in a circular orbit with a period of $5.8267311^{+0.0000074}_{-0.0000068}$ days. Internal structure modeling suggests that $\approx74\%$ of the planet's mass is composed of dense materials, such as rock and iron, forming a core, while the remaining mass consists of a low-density H/He envelope. TOI-6038~A~b lies at the transition regime between the recently identified Neptunian ridge and savanna. Having a density of $\rho_{\rm{P}}=1.62^{+0.23}_{-0.24}\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$, TOI-6038~A~b is compatible with the population of dense ridge planets ($\rho_{\rm{P}}\simeq$ 1.5-2.0 $\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$), which have been proposed to have reached their close-in locations through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HEM). First-order estimates suggest that the secular perturbations induced by TOI-6038~B may be insufficient to drive the HEM of TOI-6038~A~b. Therefore, it is not clear whether HEM driven by a still undetected companion, or early disk-driven migration, brought TOI-6038~A~b to its present-day close-in orbit. Its bright host star makes TOI-6038~A~b a prime target for atmospheric escape and orbital architecture observations, which will help us to better understand its overall evolution.","['Sanjay Baliwal', 'Rishikesh Sharma', 'Abhijit Chakraborty', 'K.

The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1,"The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.","['Durgesh Tripathi', 'A. N.

Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter,"The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.","['Philippe Brax', 'Patrick Valageas']",16.0,21.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02297,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Pattern Formation and Solitons'],,,[],2025-01-07
Lorentz force mediation of turbulent dynamo transitions,"We investigate how the strength of the Lorentz force alters stellar convection zone dynamics in a suite of buoyancy-dominated, three-dimensional, spherical shell convective dynamo models. This is done by varying only the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's electrical conductivity $\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic field and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid motions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo generation all differ across the $0.25 \leq Pm \leq 10$ range investigated here. For example, we show that strong magnetohydrodynamic effects cause a fundamental change in the surface zonal flows: differential rotation switches from solar-like (prograde equatorial zonal flow) for larger electrical conductivities to an anti-solar differential rotation (retrograde equatorial zonal flow) at lower electrical conductivities. This study shows that the value of the bulk electrical conductivity is important not only for sustaining dynamo action, but can also drive first-order changes in the characteristics of the magnetic, velocity, and temperature fields. It is also associated with the relative strength of the Lorentz force in the system as measured by the local magnetic Rossby number, $Ro_\ell^M$, which we show is crucial in setting the characteristics of the large-scale convection regime that generates those dynamo fields.","['Krista M.

Concept camera for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys,"Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift identify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.","['Attila Kovács', 'Garrett Keating', 'Timothy Norton']",1.0,10.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02329,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'Astrophysics of Galaxies']",,"Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 13102, id. 1310207 10 pp. (2024)","['integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy', 'far-infrared instrumentation', 'line intensity mapping', 'volu- metric galaxy survey', 'imaging spectroscopy 1', 'cos mological star-formation survey', 'cosmic star-formation history']",2025-01-07
Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654,"We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $<30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.","['Sibasish Laha', 'Eileen T.

As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly.

Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%.

Multi-wavelength Emission of Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Phase. II. Spectral Polarimetry,"Polarization spectra had been predicted within the photosphere model. For the purpose of seeking more clues to distinguish between the models, both the time-resolved and time-integrated polarization spectra from optical band to MeV gamma-rays of the magnetic reconnection model are studied here. There are two newly found differences between the two models. First, the time-integrated polarization degree (PD) of the magnetic reconnection model would in general increase with frequency for on-axis observations, while it is not monotonous for the photosphere model. Second, the variations of both the time-integrated and the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic reconnection model is not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly with frequency for the photosphere model. Therefore, future energy-resolved polarization analysis could distinguish between the two models. In addition, the PA rotation spectra are studied for the first time. The rotation value of PA within the burst duration will decrease with the increase of the observational energy band. Most significant PA rotation would happen for slightly off-axis observations in each energy band. The PA would rotate even for on-axis observations in optical band. Compared with the aligned magnetic field case, the PA rotation is quite rare in the gamma-ray band for the case with a toroidal field in the radiation region.","['Jia-Sheng Li', 'Mi-Xiang Lan']",12.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02397,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-ray bursts (629)'],2025-01-07

VLT VIMOS Integral Field Spectroscopy of the nova remnant FH Ser,"FH Ser experienced a slow classical nova outburst in February 1970 that was the first one observed at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. Its nova remnant is elliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament along its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D spatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to assess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that reveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate ellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most prominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities of 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with respect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the ring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main ellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy of 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser with similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane, most likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of integral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to disentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical structure.","['M.A. Guerrero', 'E.

Global 21 cm signal: a promising probe of primordial features,"Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k > k^{\rm turn}$ and $k < k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} < k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] < 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.","['Suvedha Suresh Naik', 'Pravabati Chingangbam', 'Saurabh Singh', 'Andrei Mesinger', 'Kazuyuki Furuuchi']",15.0,30.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02538,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Theory'],,,[],2025-01-07
Investigating the Redshift Evolution of Lensing Galaxy Density Slopes via Model-Independent Distance Ratios,"Strong lensing systems, expected to be abundantly discovered by next-generation surveys, offer a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy evolution. The connection between galaxy structure and cosmology through distance ratios highlights the need to examine the evolution of lensing galaxy mass density profiles. We propose a novel, dark energy-model-independent method to investigate the mass density slopes of lensing galaxies and their redshift evolution using an extended power-law (EPL) model. We employ a non-parametric approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained on Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data to reconstruct distance ratios of strong lensing systems. These ratios are compared with theoretical predictions to estimate the evolution of EPL model parameters. Analyses conducted at three levels, including the combined sample, individual lenses, and binned groups, ensure robust and reliable estimates. A negative trend in the mass density slope with redshift is observed, quantified as $\partial\gamma/\partial z = -0.20 \pm 0.12$ under a triangular prior for anisotropy. This study demonstrates that the redshift evolution of density slopes in lensing galaxies can be determined independently of dark energy models. Simulations based on LSST Rubin Observatory forecasts, which anticipate 100,000 strong lenses, show that spectroscopic follow-up of just 10 percent of these systems can constrain the redshift evolution coefficient with uncertainty ($\Delta\partial\gamma/\partial z$) to 0.021. This precision distinguishes evolving and non-evolving density slopes, providing new insights into galaxy evolution and cosmology.","['Shuaibo Geng', 'Margherita Grespan', 'Hareesh Thuruthipilly', 'Sreekanth Harikumar', 'Agnieszka Pollo', 'Marek Biesiada']",16.0,16.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02577,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['galaxy evolution – strong gravitational lensing 1'],2025-01-07
Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: I. Generalized Ambartsumian (1937) approach and the family of power-law distributions of eccentricity,"The orbital parameter space of wide, weakly bound binary stars has been shaped by the still poorly known circumstances of their formation, as well as by subsequent dynamical evolution in parent clusters and in the field. The advance of the Gaia mission astrometry takes statistical studies of wide stellar systems to an unprecedented level of precision and scope. On the theoretical side of the problem, the old approach proposed by Jeans and developed by Ambartsumian is revisited here. It is shown how certain simplifying assumptions about the phase density of binary systems in the framework of general copula distributions can lead to a family of analytical representations for the marginal distribution of orbital eccentricity, including accommodating and flexible power-law models. We further demonstrate the application of these models in forward Monte Carlo simulations of the measured motion angles between the relative velocity and separation vectors on the example of 170K listed Gaia binary systems, providing inference in the intrinsic distribution of orbital eccentricity.",['Valeri V.

Parametrization Framework for the Deceleration Parameter in Scalar Field Dark Energy Model,"We propose a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with a scalar field that represents dark energy. A new parametrization of the deceleration parameter is introduced of the form $q = 1 + \eta (1 + \mu a^{\eta})$ where $\eta$ and $\mu$ are model parameters. and the compatibility of the model is constrained by recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ and Baryon Acoustic Observations. By considering a variable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the universe, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the model are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison is then made with the $\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We examine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and equation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal insights into what has been dubbed ""dynamical dark energy"" under the assumptions made above. Our method provides a framework that is independent of the model to explore dark energy, leading to a deeper and more subtle understanding of the mechanisms driving late-time cosmic acceleration.",['Aroonkumar Beesham'],9.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02592,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[': Cosmological model'],2025-01-07
Variation of global and local flows in the solar convection zone during activity cycles 24 and 25,"Convection, differential rotation, and meridional circulation of solar plasma are studied based on helioseismic data covering the period from May 2010 to August 2024, significantly prolonged compared to that previously considered. Depth variation in the spatial spectrum of convective motions indicates a superposition of differently scaled flows. The giant-cell-scale component of the velocity field demonstrates a tendency to form meridionally elongated (possibly bananashaped) structures. The integrated spectral power of the flows is anticorrelated with the solar-activity level in the near-surface layers and positively correlates with it in deeper layers. An extended 22-year cycle of zonal flows (""torsional oscillations"" of the Sun) and variations of the meridional flows are traced.

Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions,"Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.",['Anne M.

The quest for a stable disk,"The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. Toomre claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal mass halo, to be a notable counter-example, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations due to complicated non-linear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise-driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.","['J A Sellwood', 'R G Carlberg']",10.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02636,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Spiral galaxies (1560) — Galaxy structure (622) — Galaxy dynamics ( 591) — Galaxy evolution (594) 1'],2025-01-07

The outburst-fragmentation events can lead to a runaway process where the increasing spin rate, driven by outgassing torques, results in repeated mass loss, until the sublimating body completely disintegrates.","['Jane Luu', 'David Jewitt']",6.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02645,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Comets (251) — Solar system (1736) 1'],2025-01-07
Testing disc reprocessing models for AGN optical variability by comparison of X-ray and optical power spectra of NGC 4395,"It is generally thought that AGN optical variability is produced, at least in part, by reprocessing of central X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc, resulting in wavelength-dependent lags between bands. Any good model of AGN optical variability should explain not only these lags, but also the overall pattern of variability as quantified by the power spectral density (PSD). Here we present $\sim$daily g'-band monitoring of the low-mass AGN NGC\,4395 over 3 years. Together with previous TESS and GTC/HiPERCAM observations we produce an optical PSD covering an unprecedented frequency range of $\sim7$ decades allowing excellent determination of PSD parameters. The PSD is well fitted by a bending power law with low-frequency slope $\alpha_{L} = 1.0 \pm 0.2$, high-frequency slope $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$ and bend timescale $3.0^{+6.6}_{-1.7}\,$\,d. This timescale is close to that derived previously from a damped random walk (DRW) model fitted to just the TESS observations, although $\alpha_{L}$ is too steep to be consistent with a DRW. We compare the observed PSD with one made from light curves synthesized assuming reprocessing of X-rays, as observed by \xmm and Swift, in a disc defined by the observed lags. The simulated PSD is also well described by a bending power law but with a bend two decades higher in frequency. We conclude that the large-amplitude optical variations seen on long-timescales are not due to disc reprocessing but require a second source of variability whose origin is unknown but could be propagating disc accretion rate variations.","['Max Beard', 'Ian McHardy', 'Keith Horne', 'Edward Cackett', 'Federico Vincentelli', 'Juan Venancio Hernandez Santisteban', 'Jake Miller', 'Vikram Dhillon', 'Johan Knapen', 'Stuart Littlefair', 'Daniel Kynoch', 'Elmé Breedt', 'Yue Shen', 'Jonathan Gelbord']",17.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02664,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['galaxies:active – galaxies:individual:NGC 4395 – X-rays:galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have long been observed to emit X-ray continua that vary rapidly and non-periodically (e'],2025-01-07
The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits,"Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.","['Huan-rong Yuan', 'Ying Wang', 'Xin Wu', 'Ji-wei Xie', 'Hui-gen Liu', 'Ji-lin Zhou', 'Wei Sun']",17.0,20.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02717,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['Solar-planetary interactions (1472) — Hot Jupiters(753) — Exoplanet evo- lution(491) 1'],2025-01-07
Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane,"The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a non-parametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with experimental observations within the uncertainty. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.","['Jiayin He', 'Houdun Zeng', 'Yi Zhang', 'Qiang Yuan', 'Rui Zhang', 'Jun Li']",5.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02720,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,['Gamma-ray astronomy (628)'],2025-01-07
Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge,"We have detected the 10 um silicate feature and the 11.3 um crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic Bulge. The depths of the 10 um feature indicate highly-obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the Spectral Energy Distributions of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The sixteen sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relation, associated with the Long Secondary Period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially-enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g. OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1-0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially-enhanced.","['Steven R.

On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model,"The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy (Clauser, Parker) for the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the wind channel area, which is described precisely by Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models for the solar wind.",['Bhimsen Shivamoggi'],0.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02731,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,[],2025-01-07
Probing the Merger Rates of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies with Gravitational Waves,"The mergers of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key drivers of galaxy evolution, contributing to the growth of both galaxies and their central black holes. Current projects like Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and upcoming missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin are designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by SMBH binaries during their inspiral and merger phases. We investigate the capability to probe the merger rates of SMBHs and their host galaxies by combining current PTA detections and mock GW data for LISA-like detectors, while incorporating observational constraints from the $M_{\bullet}-M_*$ relationship and galaxy stellar mass functions. Our findings highlight the critical role of GW detections with LISA-like detectors in exploring the merger rates of galaxies and SMBHs and the timescale of SMBH mergers. Additionally, incorporating PTA constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background further refines model parameters and reduces uncertainties. Gravitational wave detections offer an independent method for estimating galaxy merger rates, providing a valuable consistency check against rates derived from galaxy pair observations and cosmological simulations. Furthermore, comparing SMBH mass assembly through mergers with growth via accretion provides key insights into the evolutionary history of SMBHs, with the timescale of SMBH binary mergers playing a significant role in shaping their merger rates and merger mass assembly.","['Yun Fang', 'Rong-Gen Cai']",8.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02748,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['gravitational waves – supermassive black holes – galaxies – merger rate – methods: Bayesian inference 1 INTRODUCTION Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the centers ofmassivegalaxies'],2025-01-07
A Scenario for Origin of Global 4 mHz Oscillations in Solar Corona,"We establish a spherically symmetric model of solar atmosphere, which consists of the whole chromosphere and low corona below the $1.25$ solar radius. It is a hydrodynamic model with heating in the chromosphere through an artificial energy flux. We performed a series of simulations with our model and found oscillations with a peak frequency of $\sim$4 $\rm{mHz}$ in the power spectrum. We confirmed that this resulted from the $p$-mode excited in the transition region and amplified in a resonant cavity situated in the height range $\sim$$4\times10^3$--$2\times10^4$ km. This result is consistent with global observations of Alfvénic waves in corona and can naturally explain the observational ubiquity of $4\ \rm{mHz}$ without the difficulty of the $p$-mode passing through the acoustic-damping chromosphere. We also confirmed that acoustic shock waves alone cannot heat the corona to the observed temperature, and found mass upflows in the height range $\sim$$7\times10^3$--$7\times10^4$ km in our model, which pumped the dense and cool plasma into the corona and might be the mass supplier for solar prominences.","['Li Xue', 'Cheng-Liang Jiao', 'Li-Xin Zhang']",8.0,21.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02753,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics'],2025-01-07
Polarimetric Study of GRS 1915+105: Estimation of Interstellar Polarization Component,"GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds.

Testing General Relativity using Large Scale Structures Photometric Redshift Surveys and Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing Effect,"The $E_G$ statistic provides a valuable tool for evaluating predictions of General Relativity (GR) by probing the relationship between gravitational potential and galaxy clustering on cosmological scales within the observable universe. In this study, we constrain the $E_G$ statistic using photometric redshift data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) MagLim sample in combination with the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing map. Unlike spectroscopic redshift surveys, photometric redshift measurements are subject to significant redshift uncertainties, making it challenging to constrain the redshift distortion parameter $\beta$ with high precision. We adopt a new definition for this parameter, $\beta(z) = {f\sigma_8(z)}/{b\sigma_8(z)}$. In this formulation, we reconstruct the growth rate of structure, $f\sigma_8(z)$, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) method, while simultaneously utilizing model-independent constraints on the parameter $b\sigma_8(z)$, directly obtained from the DES collaboration. After obtaining the angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$ (galaxy-galaxy) and $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$ (galaxy-CMB lensing) from the combination of DES photometric data and Planck lensing, we derive new measurements of the $E_G$ statistic: $E_G = 0.354 \pm 0.146$, $0.452 \pm 0.092$, $0.414 \pm 0.069$, and $0.296 \pm 0.069$ (68$\%$ C.L.) across four redshift bins: $z = 0.30, 0.47, 0.63$, and $0.80$, respectively, which are consistent with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we forecast the $E_G$ statistic using future photometric redshift data from the China Space Station Telescope, combined with lensing measurements from the CMB-S4 project, indicating an achievable constraint on $E_G$ of approximately 1$\%$, improving the precision of tests for GR on cosmological scales.","['Shang Li', 'Jun-Qing Xia']",6.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02852,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,ApJS,,['Large-scale structure of the universe (902)'],2025-01-07
High-temperature measurements of acetylene VUV absorption cross sections and application to warm exoplanet atmospheres,"Most observed exoplanets have high equilibrium temperatures. Understanding the chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires the use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal dependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of molecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to uncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to study experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of molecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for use in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured absorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773 K recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical model, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot Jupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of C2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115 to 185 nm and rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2 calculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of 40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at 773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher in the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase in the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the abundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4). We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV absorption cross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures. Similar studies of other major species are needed to improve our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.","['Benjamin Fleury', 'Mathilde Poveda', 'Yves Benilan', 'Roméo Veillet', 'Olivia Venot', 'Pascal Tremblin', 'Nicolas Fray', 'Marie-Claire Gazeau', 'Martin Schwell', 'Antoine Jolly', 'Nelson de Oliveira', 'Et-touhami Es-sebbar']",11.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02864,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,"A&A, 693, A82 (2025)",['Astrochemistry – Molecular data – Methods: laboratory: molecular – Techniques: spectroscopic – Planets and satellites: atmospheres 1'],2025-01-07
Revealing the internal magnetic field configuration of magnetars via their associated periodic signals,"The magnetic deformation of magnetars is affected by their internal magnetic fields, which are generally difficult to be measured directly through observations. In this work, the periodic pulse-phase modulations in the hard X-ray emissions of the magnetars 4U 0142+61, 1E 1547.0-5408, SGR 1900+14, and SGR 1806-20, and the periodicities of fast radio bursts (FRBs) 180916 and 121102 are interpreted as free precession of the (host) magnetars. Using these periodic signals, we investigate the magnetars' internal magnetic fields. In order to simultaneously account for the modulation periods and surface thermal emissions of the former four magnetars, and require that their internal poloidal fields smoothly connect with the surface dipole fields, the parameter that characterizes the distribution of toroidal field in the magnetar interior should satisfy $\beta\gtrsim1$. Moreover, their volume-averaged strengths of poloidal and toroidal fields are respectively $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\sim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\sim10^{15}$ G with the strength ratios $\bar{B}_{\rm t}/\bar{B}_{\rm p}$ generally distributing within $\sim2$--$37$. We could also constrain the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity in the neutron-star core considering that the former four magnetars are probably precessing, and the most stringent constraint is $T_{\rm c,core}<6.4\times10^8$ K. Adopting a possible critical temperature $T_{\rm c,core}=5\times10^8$ K, we could obtain $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G for the host magnetars of FRBs 180916 and 121102, which indicates that the magnetars of our interest possibly have similar poloidal and toroidal fields.","['Jie Shu', 'Quan Cheng', 'Xiao-Ping Zheng']",3.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02887,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Theory'],PRD,,[],2025-01-07
Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a non-canonical pseudo-scalar,"A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-scalar. We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the inflaton.","[""Jun'ya Kume"", 'Marco Peloso', 'Nicola Bartolo']",4.0,28.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02890,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-07
Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation,"Aims. Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically-formed - or, 'three-body' - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory.Methods. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using the 3.5PN equations of motion. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.Results. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically-active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. We obtain a local rate of GW captures of $\mathcal{R}(z\simeq0)\rm\simeq1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$, as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also find that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions are very wide and not likely to merge via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations because they quickly break up in subsequent interactions with BHs and BBHs. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs","['Daniel Marín Pina', 'Mark Gieles', 'Tomas Andrade', 'Alessandro A.

The puzzle of isolated and quenched dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids,"We report, for the first time, the detection of a sample of quenched and isolated dwarf galaxies (with 8.9 $<$ log(M$_{\rm \star}$/M$_{\rm \odot}$) $<$ 9.5) in the least dense regions of the cosmic web, including voids, filaments, and walls. These dwarfs have no neighbouring galaxy within 1.0~Mpc in projected distance. Based on the full spectral fitting of their central spectra using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, these galaxies are gas-deprived, exhibit stellar mass assembly very similar to dwarfs in the central regions of galaxy clusters, and have experienced no significant star formation in the past 2 Gyr. Additionally, analysis of r-band images from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey showed that these dwarf galaxies host a central Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC). Detecting quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids indicates that environmental factors are not the sole drivers of their quenching. Internal mechanisms, such as feedback from in-situ star formation, also contributing to the NSC formation, black holes, or variations in conditions during their formation, offer potential explanations for star formation suppression in these galaxies.

Searches for primary photons and neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory,"The Pierre Auger Observatory stands as the largest detector for ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays. The Observatory is also sensitive to UHE photons and neutrinos that can be produced along with UHE cosmic rays or in top-down processes, such as the decay of dark matter particles. The search for these neutral particles relies on the hybrid measurements of extensive air showers, combining a fluorescence detector with a surface detector array and an underground muon detector. We present an overview of the searches for UHE photons and neutrinos utilizing data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Currently, no photon or neutrino candidates have been identified. Consequently, we report on the most stringent limits to the integral UHE photon and neutrino fluxes above 50 PeV and 100 PeV, respectively, from diffuse and point-like steady sources. These limits led to strong constraints on theoretical models describing the cosmological evolution of the acceleration sites and the nature of dark-matter particles. Lastly, we briefly comment on the searches for these neutral particles in coincidence with gravitational wave events, underscoring the pivotal role of the Observatory in the context of multi-messenger astronomy at the highest energies.",['Nicolás M.

Challenges in identifying the coronal hole wind,"Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source region. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the scheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton plasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible explanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in the scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole wind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind at the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole wind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a comparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an unsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that the scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow solar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means classification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first of which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is dominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind from low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because during this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was observed. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification needs to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the phase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification of the solar wind.","['Verena Heidrich-Meisner', 'Sophie Teichmann', 'Lars Berger', 'Robert F.

Evolution of the S\'ersic Index up to z=2.5 from JWST and HST,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR Sérsic index ($n$), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range $0.5\leq z\leq2.5$. We infer rest-frame near-IR Sérsic profiles for $\approx 15.000$ galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical Sérsic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median Sérsic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies ($M_\star > 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$), which show an increase from $n\approx 2.5$ to $n\approx 4$ at $z<1$. High-mass galaxies have higher $n$ than lower-mass galaxies ($M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at $z>1$. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR $n$ at z>1 (but not at z<1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At $z>1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$ is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.","['Marco Martorano', 'Arjen van der Wel', 'Maarten Baes', 'Eric F.

Gaussian process regression of temperature-dependent radial velocities,"Gaussian processes (GPs) described by quasi-periodic covariance functions have in recent years become a widely used tool to model the impact of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements. We perform a GP regression analysis on solar RV time series measured from spectral segments formed at different temperatures within the photosphere in order to evaluate the relation between the best-fit GP kernel hyperparameters and the observed activity signal as a function of temperature. The posterior distributions of the hyperparameters show subtle differences between high- and low-activity phases and as a function of the spectral formation temperature range, which could have implications on the characteristics of the activity signal and its optimal modelling. For the temperature-dependent RVs, we find that at high and low activity alike, the minimal RV dispersion is obtained at intermediately cool temperature ranges (4000-4750 K), for both the observed and GP model-subtracted RVs. Finally, we compare and correlate our temperature-dependent RVs with RV components derived from disk-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun, for which we find a consistently strong correlation between RVs related to hotter temperature ranges and the dominant RV component due to the inhibition of convection.","['Federica Rescigno', 'Khaled Al Moulla']",5.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02959,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,MNRAS,,"['Sun: activity – techniques: radial velocities – methods: statistical 1 INTRODUCTION In the last three decades', '000 different exoplanets and have contributed to characterising the masses of thousands more', 'from gas giants to rocky planets', 'radial velocity (RV) analyses have suc- cessfully detected more than 1']",2025-01-07
Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations,"Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.","['Di Luo', 'Yan-Heng Yu', 'Jun-Peng Li', 'Sai Wang']",5.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02965,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-07
Resolving the mass transfer in the symbiotic recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis,"T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with an 80-year recurrence interval whose next eruption is imminent. We aim to resolve the accretion mechanism of the binary system governing the mass transfer during its super-active phase. Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we analyze the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity. We perform Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the system's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find evidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the super-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The accretion disc is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its maximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation energies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright spot at the stream impact on the accretion disc outer radius, the irradiation at the red-giant facing side, the stream-disc overflow, the accretion disk wind, and an expanding bipolar nebula. The bipolar jet emerged at the rise of the super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years. The temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure from quiescence started in the disc, likely triggered by a disc instability similar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass accretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further enhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase. Conclusions. Symbiotic recurrent novae, such as T CrB, are governed by similar mass-transfer mechanisms as found in cataclysmic variables despite their different orbital properties (longer orbital periods imposing larger accretion discs) and evolutionary pathways.","['L.

ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution,"A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a non-parametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage Graphics Processing Unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real-time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor for upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g. the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky-background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.","['Yashil Sukurdeep', 'Tamás Budavári', 'Andrew J.

An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline,"The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, the current Kepler catalog exhibits insufficient reliability for long-period low signal-to-noise planets due to systematic false alarms caused by correlated and non-Gaussian noise. As a result, it remains hard to measure the occurrence rate of such planets.We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small (Kepler MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve the occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. It provides a tail-less background distribution with a rate of $\sim$1 false alarm per search for MES$\sim$7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of 7.5-9 and $>$4 transits due to the background distribution control.We conducted a search on the entirety of Kepler data, applying permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of planetary origin for every candidate.

"An accurate and simple, asymptotically matched deprojection of the Sersic law","The Sersic law reproduces very well the surface brightness profile of early-type galaxies, and therefore is routinely used in observational and theoretical works. Unfortunately, its deprojection can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions for generic values of the shape parameter $n$. Over the years, different families of approximate deprojection formulae have been proposed, generally based on fits of the numerical deprojection over some radial range. We searched for a very simple, accurate, and theoretically motivated deprojection formula of the Sersic law, without free parameters, not based on fits of the numerical deprojection, and holding for generic $n > 1$. The formula has been found by requiring it to reproduce the analytical expressions for the inner and outer asymptotic expansions of the deprojected Sersic law of given $n$, and by matching the two expansions at intermediate radii with the request that the total luminosity coincides with that of the original Sersic profile of same $n$. The resulting formula is algebraically very simple, by construction its inner and outer parts are the exact (asymptotic) deprojection of the Sersic law, and it depends on two coefficients that are analytical functions of $n$ of immediate evaluation. The accuracy of the formula over the whole radial range is very good and increases for increasing $n$, with maximum relative deviations from the true numerical deprojection of $\simeq 8\,10^{-3}$ for the de Vaucouleurs profile. In the Appendix, the extension of the proposed formula to profiles with $n <1$ is also presented and discussed. The formula obtained is a useful tool of simple use in the modeling of early-type galaxies. Its ellipsoidal generalization is immediate.","['L. Ciotti', 'L. De Deo', 'S.

Shear-gravity transition determines the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in molecular clouds: confronting analytical formula with observations,"The velocity dispersion-size relation is a crucial indicator of the dynamic properties of interstellar gas. Recent observations reveal a steep velocity dispersion-size relation ($\sigma_{\rm v}\sim R^{\beta}$) with the index $\beta> 0.6$, which cannot be explained by a single mechanism with only gravity ($\beta\sim0.5$) or shear ($\beta \sim 1$). We present a two-component model $\sigma_{\rm v_{mixture}} = \lambda_1 \sigma_{\rm v_{g}} + \lambda_2 \sigma_{\rm v_{shear}} = A[(GM/R)^{\frac{1}{2}} + f(R/t_{\rm shear})]$ to explain the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in the observation from e.g. Miville et al. (2017) and Zhou et al. (2022). We find that the velocity dispersion of small clouds is mainly caused by self-gravity, while large clouds are primarily affected by shear, and these two regimes are linked by a gradual transition with a transition scale $\sim100$ pc. The variation of cloud velocity dispersion with the Galactocentric distance results from the variation of both cloud internal density structure and Galactic shear. Our two-component model captures how the dynamics of the molecular gas can be affected by both internal and external factors, and we expect it to be applied to data from galaxies with different physical conditions to reveal the physics.","['Yi-Heng Xie', 'Guang-Xing Li']",9.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03027,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,APJL,,['Milky Way Galaxy(1054) — Galaxy dynamics(591) — Interstellar medium(847) — In- terstellar dynamics(839) — Molecular clouds(1072) — Galaxy rotation(618) — Scaling relations(2031) 1'],2025-01-07
Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes,"Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a ""boom"" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n>1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}","['G.

Electrostatic instability of non-spherical dust in sub-stellar clouds,"Charged dust clouds play an important role in the evolution of sub-stellar atmospheres through electrical discharges such as lightning events or inter-grain discharges. The consequent plasma activation presents an alternative source of disequilibrium chemistry, potentially triggering a set of chemical reactions otherwise energetically unavailable. The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the electrostatic stability of charged spheroidal dust grains in sub-stellar clouds and its impact on inter-grain electrostatic discharges, the available area for atmospheric gas-phase surface chemistry, the particle eccentricity distribution function and observed polarization signatures. This paper has derived the criterion for the allowed values of dust eccentricity that are electrostatically stable as a function of grain size $a\in[0.2,1.8]~\mu$m, floating potential $\phi_{f}\in[1, 10]$~V and tensile strength $\Sigma_{s}=10^{3}$~Pa. As a consequence of electrostatic instability we also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal poles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the particle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of polarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be electrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical value will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to spheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform surface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible to electrostatic instability. In this context electrostatic erosion presents a mechanism that may produce bumpy, irregularly shaped or porous grains.","['Craig R. Stark', 'Declan A. Diver', 'Matthew I.

Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes,"Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.",['Antonio Junior Iovino'],7.0,283.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03065,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,"['Inflation', 'Primordial Black Holes', 'Cosmology', 'Gravity Waves', 'Dark Matter']",2025-01-07
Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 5 September 2022 SEP Event,"On September 5, 2022, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.","['A.

Solar variability in the Mg II h and k lines,"Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability of Mg II h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg II index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, Mg II index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg II index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover the climate relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg II index and its variability based on the well-established SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg II index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize Mg II index timeseries on climate relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the timeseries of the Mg II index spanning nearly three centuries.","['K.

A two-hump spectrum in the prompt emission of GRB 240825A,"An extra hard spectral component that extends to GeV energies, in additional to the typical sub- MeV Band component, appears in several gamma-ray burst (GRBs) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescopes (LAT). Only in one case (i.e., GRB 090926A), a spectral break feature at the high energy end is identified in the extra hard component, but the photon counts are not enough to distinguish between the cutoff model and the broken power law model for the spectral break. In this work, we report the detection of an extra hard component showing the spectral break in GRB 240825A. We find that a broken power-law model fits the spectral data of the extra component better than a single power-law with an exponential cutoff in the time resolved spectrum for the second emission pulse, with a break at about 50 MeV. This spectral feature disfavors the gamma-ray opacity to pair creation as the origin of the spectral break, but points to an intrinsic peak for the extra component. The low ratio between the peak of the extra hard component and that of the Band component challenges the synchrotron self-Compton origin for the extra component. Alternative scenarios, such as the inverse Compton scattering of the photosphere emission, are discussed. In addition, we find a clear transition from the prompt emission to afterglow emission at GeV energies in GRB 240825A, manifested by a temporal steep decay and an unique spectral evolution.","['Hai-Ming Zhang', 'Zi-Qi Wang', 'Cui-Yuan Dai', 'Yi-Yun Huang', 'Ruo-Yu Liu', 'En-Wei Liang', 'Xiang-Yu Wang']",5.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03082,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-ray bursts (629) — High energy astrophysics (739)) 1'],2025-01-07
Spectra of standing kink waves in loops and the effects of the lower solar atmosphere,"Understanding the effects of the lower solar atmosphere on the spectrum of standing kink oscillations of coronal loops, in both the decaying and decayless regime, is essential for developing more advanced tools for coronal seismology. We aim to reveal the effects of the chromosphere on the spatial profiles and frequencies of the standing kink modes, create synthetic emission maps to compare with observations, and study the results using spatial and temporal coronal seismology techniques. We excited transverse oscillations in a 3D straight flux tube using (a) a broadband footpoint driver, (b) a sinusoidal velocity pulse, and (c) an off-centre Gaussian velocity pulse, using the PLUTO code. The flux tube is gravitationally stratified, with footpoints embedded in chromospheric plasma. Using the FoMo code, we created synthetic observations of our data in the Fe IX 17.1 nm line and calculated the spectra with the Auto-NUWT code. We also numerically solved the generalised eigenvalue system for the 1D wave equation to determine the effects of the stratification on the kink modes of our system. The synthetic observations of the loops perturbed by the velocity pulses show a single dominant mode that our 1D analysis reveals to be the third harmonic of the system. For the broadband driver, the synthetic emission shows multiple frequency bands, associated with both the loop and the driver. Finally, using seismological techniques, we highlight the possibility of misidentifying the observed third, sixth, and ninth harmonics with the first, second, and third harmonics of the coronal part of longer loops. Unless more advanced techniques of spatial seismology are used with many data points from observations along the entire loop length, this misidentification can result in overestimating the mean magnetic field by a factor equal to the period ratio of the fundamental over the third harmonic.","['Konstantinos Karampelas', 'Daye Lim', 'Tom Van Doorsselaere', 'Yuhang Gao']",9.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03089,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['magnetohydrodynamics - solar coronal seismology - solar coronal waves - magnetohydrodynamical simulations 1'],2025-01-07
The coronal power spectrum from MHD mode conversion above sunspots,"Sunspots are intense regions of magnetic flux that are rooted deep below the photosphere. It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic waves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic (or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition layer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate upwards into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfvénic modes in the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the resulting power spectra of coronal Alfvénic waves. A broadband wave source is used that has a 1D power spectrum which mimics aspects of the observed p-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode conversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the upwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a gravitationally stratified atmosphere, and plays a key role in shaping the power spectra of mode converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow, fast magnetoacoustic waves and Alfvén waves above the equipartition layer have similarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver spectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have a peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This matches observations of coronal Alfvénic waves and further supports the role of mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfvénic wave generation in the Sun's atmosphere.","['Hemanthi Miriyala', 'Richard J.

The NewAthena mission concept in the context of the next decade of X-ray astronomy,"Large X-ray observatories such as Chandra and XMM-Newton have been delivering scientific breakthroughs in research fields as diverse as our Solar System, the astrophysics of stars, stellar explosions and compact objects, accreting super-massive black holes, and large-scale structures traced by the hot plasma permeating and surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. The recently launched observatory XRISM is opening in earnest the new observational window of non-dispersive high-resolution spectroscopy. However, several quests are left open, such as the effect of the stellar radiation field on the habitability of nearby planets, the Equation-of-State regulating matter in neutron stars, the origin and distribution of metals in the Universe, the processes driving the cosmological evolution of the baryons locked in the gravitational potential of Dark Matter and the impact of supermassive black hole growth on galaxy evolution, just to mention a few. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is a key player in multi-messenger astrophysics. Addressing these quests experimentally requires an order-of-magnitude leap in sensitivity, spectroscopy and survey capabilities with respect to existing X-ray observatories.

Cloudy-Maraston: Integrating nebular continuum and line emission with the Maraston stellar population synthesis models,"The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H$\rm \beta$, H$\rm \alpha$, [N II]$\lambda 6583$, and [S II]$\lambda 6731$ luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II$\lambda$1640 and [O III]$\lambda 5007$, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of $\hat{Q}_{\rm [O III]\lambda 5007} = \rm 6 \times 10^9 \; s^{-1} \, M_{\odot}^{-1}$, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.","['Sophie L.

Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet,"The Beta Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We perform an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carry out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we have found that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.","['A. Lacquement', 'H. Beust', 'V. Faramaz-Gorka', 'G.

Quantifying the detection likelihood of faint peaks in interferometric data through jackknifing: Test application on finding $z>10$ galaxy candidates,"False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying $z\sim3-4$ passive galaxies as $z>10$ galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of $z>10$ galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, $jackknify$, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these $z>10$ galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.","['Joshiwa van Marrewijk', 'Melanie Kaasinen', 'Gergö Popping', 'Luca Di Mascolo', 'Tony Mroczkowski', 'Leindert Boogaard', 'Francesco Valentino', 'Tom Bakx', 'Ilsang Yoon']",10.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03150,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,"['galaxies:high-redsfhits – galaxies:individual:S5-z17-1', 'Glass-z10 – techniques:interferometric 1', 'Glass-z12']",2025-01-07
"Pseudo-Newtonian simulation of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordstr\""om naked singularity","We present the first numerical simulations of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordström (RN) naked singularity (a charged point mass). The gravity of the RN naked singularity is modeled with a pseudo-Newtonian potential that reproduces exactly the radial dependence of the RN Keplerian orbital frequency; in particular, orbital angular velocity vanishes at the zero gravity radius and has a maximum at 4/3 of that radius. Angular momentum is transported outwards by viscous stresses only outside the location of this maximum. Nonetheless, even at that radius, accretion proceeds at higher latitudes, the disk having thickened there owing to excess pressure. The accretion stops at a certain distance away from the singularity, with the material accumulating in a toroidal structure close to the zero-gravity sphere. The shape of the structure obtained in our simulations is reminiscent of fluid figures of equilibrium analytically derived in full general relativity for the RN singularity. The presence of a rotating ring, such as the one found in our simulations, could be an observational signature of a naked singularity. For charge to mass ratios close to but larger than unity, the inner edge of the quasi-toroidal inner accretion structure would be located well within the Schwarzschild marginally stable orbit (ISCO), and the maximum orbital frequency in thin accretion disks would be much higher than the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency.","['Miljenko Čemeljić', 'Włodek Kluźniak', 'Ruchi Mishra', 'Maciek Wielgus']",4.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03178,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gravitational singularities 1'],2025-01-07
Superhabitable Planets Around Mid-Type K Dwarf Stars Enhance Simulated JWST Observability and Surface Habitability,"In our search for life beyond the Solar System, certain planetary bodies may be more conducive to life than Earth. However, the observability of these `superhabitable' planets in the habitable zones around K dwarf stars has not been fully modeled. This study addresses this gap by modeling the atmospheres of superhabitable exoplanets. We employed the 1D model $\texttt{Atmos}$ to define the superhabitable parameter space, $\texttt{POSEIDON}$ to calculate synthetic transmission spectra, and $\texttt{PandExo}$ to simulate $\text{JWST}$ observations. Our results indicate that planets orbiting mid-type K dwarfs, receiving $80\%$ of Earth's solar flux, are optimal for life. These planets sustain temperate surfaces with moderate $CO_2$ levels, unlike those receiving $60\%$ flux, where necessarily higher $CO_2$ levels could hinder biosphere development. Moreover, they are easier to observe, requiring significantly fewer transits for biosignature detection compared to Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. For instance, detecting biosignature pairs like oxygen and methane from $30$ parsecs would require $150$ transits ($43$ years) for a superhabitable planet, versus over $1700$ transits ($\sim 1700$ years) for Earth-like planets. While such observation times lie outside of $\text{JWST}$ mission timescales, our study underscores the necessity of next-generation telescopes and provides valuable targets for future observations with, for example, the $\text{ELT}$.","['Iva Vilović', 'Jayesh Goyal', 'René Heller', 'Fanny Marie von Schauenburg']",16.0,30.0,4900.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03214,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['Director ’s Discretionary Time', 'astrobiology -- methods: numerical -- stars: K dwarfs Abbr eviations: DDT']",2025-01-07
No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times,"Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as $z \simeq 14$, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. It has also been discovered that fairly massive galaxies existed at early times, a finding again viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this simple model matches the observed galaxy UV LF over the redshift range $z \simeq 6-13$ and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at $z \simeq 6-8$. When combined with new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency of early galaxies, our model also predicts the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observational constraints. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, and our model only works if the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond $z \simeq 6$. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at $z \simeq 15$. A key prediction of our model is thus that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the numbers of galaxy number density beyond $z \simeq 15$, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.","['C.

The Variable X-ray Emission of the Cataclysmic Variable V1460 Her with a Rapidly Rotating White Dwarf,"Using a recent Chandra ACIS observation of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) V1460 Her (2MASS J16211735+4412541) with a fast-rotating ($P_{\rm spin} = 38.9$~s) white dwarf, we estimated a flux $F_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}}^{\rm abs} = (1.9\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\sim7$ lower than found from previous Swift XRT observations $\approx8$ years ago, when the CV was quiescent.

Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals,"Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike ""dry EMRIs"", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.","['Zhenwei Lyu', 'Zhen Pan', 'Junjie Mao', 'Ning Jiang', 'Huan Yang']",5.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03252,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-08
Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars,"Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$.

High count rate effects in event processing for XRISM/Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter: I. Ground test,"The spectroscopic performance of an X-ray microcalorimeter is compromised at high count rates. In this study, we utilize the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the XRISM satellite to examine the effects observed during high count rate measurements and propose modeling approaches to mitigate them. We specifically address the following instrumental effects that impact performance: CPU limit, pile-up, and untriggered electrical cross talk. Experimental data at high count rates were acquired during ground testing using the flight model instrument and a calibration X-ray source. In the experiment, data processing not limited by the performance of the onboard CPU was run in parallel, which cannot be done in orbit. This makes it possible to access the data degradation caused by limited CPU performance. We use these data to develop models that allow for a more accurate estimation of the aforementioned effects. To illustrate the application of these models in observation planning, we present a simulated observation of GX 13+1.

Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories with transdimensional models,Modeling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters.

Decameter-sized Earth impactors -- I: Orbital properties,"Numerous decameter-sized asteroids have been observed impacting Earth as fireballs. These objects can have impact energies equivalent to hundreds of kilotons of TNT, posing a hazard if they impact populated areas. Previous estimates of meteoroid flux using fireball observations have shown an Earth impact rate for decameter-size objects of about once every $2$-$3$ years. In contrast, telescopic estimates of the near-Earth asteroid population predict the impact rate of such objects to be of order $20$-$40$ years, an order-of-magnitude difference. While the cause of this discrepancy remains unclear, tidal disruption of a larger near-Earth body has been proposed as an explanation for these excess decameter-sized impactors. The release in 2022 of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data for fireball events has provided a wealth of new information on many of these impacts. Using this newly available USG sensor data, we present the first population-level study characterizing the orbital and dynamical properties of 14 decameter-sized Earth impactors detected by USG sensors since 1994, with a particular focus on searching for evidence of tidal disruption as the cause of the impact rate discrepancy. We find there is no evidence for recent ($\lesssim 10^4$ years) tidal disruption and weak evidence for longer-term tidal disruption in the decameter impactor population, but that the latter conclusion is limited by small number statistics. We also investigate the origins of both the impactor and near-Earth asteroid populations of decameter-sized objects from the main asteroid belt. We find that both populations generally originate from the same source regions: primarily from the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\sim70$%) with small contributions from the Hungaria group ($\sim20$%) and the 3:1 Jupiter mean-motion resonance ($\sim10$%).","['Ian Chow', 'Peter G.

Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters,"I hypothesize a physical explanation for the ""Little Red Dots"" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.",['Jillian Bellovary'],2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03309,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['High-redshift galaxies(734) — Intermediate-mass black holes(816) — Galaxy forma- tion(595) — Tidal disruption(1696) — Active galactic nuclei(16) 1'],2025-01-08
Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient,"Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.",['Antonio C.

Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients,"Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.","['Daichi Tsuna', 'Wenbin Lu']",9.0,23.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03316,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-08
On stellar hotspots due to star-planet magnetic interactions: How much power can actually be transmitted to the chromosphere?,"Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism for generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of $10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by Alfvén waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates where and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat. The stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of cool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfvén speed over a short distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfvén waves at the transition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency of energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection of the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the stellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the frequency-dependent propagation of Alfvén waves through a realistic background stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of the wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to characterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several candidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected. Low-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency waves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies. Conversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfvén waves substantially diminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result, there exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A significant fraction of the Alfvén wave energy is reflected at the stellar transition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency to the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.","['Arghyadeep Paul', 'Antoine Strugarek', 'Victor Réville']",14.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03320,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics'],Astronomy and Astrophysics,,['1'],2025-01-08

The majority of stars formed closer to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate (z > 1.3) and a great deal of star formation presently occurs in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. These environments are unified by the presence of a high interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). Numerical studies of stellar birth typically neglect this fact, and those that do not have thus far been limited in scope. In this work we present the first comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation in extreme environments where we have increased the ISRF and CRIR to values typical of the CMZ and starburst galaxies. We note changes in the fragmentation behaviour on both the core and stellar system scale, leading to top-heavy core and stellar system mass functions in high ISRF/CRIR clouds. Clouds fragment less on the core scale, producing fewer but more massive cores. Conversely, the cores fragment more intensely and produce richer clusters of stellar systems. We present a picture where high ISRF/CRIR clouds fragment less on the scale of cores and clumps, but more on the scale of stellar systems. The change in fragmentation behaviour subsequently changes the mass function of the stellar systems that form through enhanced accretion rates.","['Matt T. Cusack', 'Paul C. Clark', 'Simon C. O.

A multi-wavelength investigation of spiral structures in $z > 1$ galaxies with JWST,"Recent JWST observations have revealed the prevalence of spiral structures at $z > 1$. Unlike in the local Universe, the origin and the consequence of spirals at this epoch remain unexplored. We use public JWST/NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey to map spiral structures in eight massive ($> 10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. We present a method for systematically quantifying spiral arms at $z>1$, enabling direct measurements of flux distributions. Using rest-frame near-IR images, we construct morphological models accurately tracing spiral arms. We detect offsets ($\sim 0.2 - 0.8\,\rm kpc$) between the rest-frame optical and near-IR flux distributions across most arms. Drawing parallels to the local Universe, we conclude that these offsets reflect the presence of density waves. For nine out of eighteen arms, the offsets indicate spiral shocks triggered by density waves. Five arms have offsets in the opposite direction and are likely associated with tidal interactions. For the remaining cases with no detected offsets, we suggest that stochastic 'clumpy' star formation is the primary driver of their formation. In conclusion, we find a multi-faceted nature of spiral arms at $z > 1$, similar to that in the local Universe.","['Boris S. Kalita', 'Si-Yue Yu', 'John D. Silverman', 'Emanuele Daddi', 'Luis C.

Clumps as multiscale structures in cosmic noon galaxies,"Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich $z>1$ galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive ($>10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) main-sequence galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\sim1.5$ with $\sim0.3\,\rm kpc$ resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is $1-30\%$ towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing $1-20\%$ to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from $0\lesssim\Delta\log\rm sSFR\lesssim 0.4$. They feature star formation surface densities of $10^{-2}-10^{2}\,\rm M_{\odot}/yr/kpc^{2}$, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes ($r_{e}\sim0.1-1\,\rm kpc$) and stellar masses ($\sim 10^{8.0-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$). We estimate a mass-size relation ($r_{e}\propto\rm M_{\star}^{\,0.52\pm0.07}$) along with a stellar mass function (slope, $\alpha=-1.85\pm 0.19$), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in $z\gtrsim1$ lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images.

Identifying Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects through Neutrinos,"Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of 1-100 MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from TŻOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from TŻO candidates (e.g. VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from TŻOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect TŻOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the TŻO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.","['Pablo Martínez-Miravé', 'Irene Tamborra', 'Alejandro Vigna-Gómez']",6.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03330,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-08
The properties of GSN 069 accretion disk from a joint X-ray and UV spectral analysis: stress-testing quasi-periodic eruption models,"We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and XMM-Newton data of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069. Using ultraviolet (UV) and optical images at HST resolution, we show that GSN 069's emission consists of a point source superimposed on a diffuse stellar component. The latter accounts for $\leq 5\%$ of the UV emission in the inner 0.5""$\times$0.5"" region, while the luminosity of the former cannot be attributed to stars. Analyzing the 2014/2018 HST UV spectra, we show that to leading order the intrinsic spectral shape is $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{4/3}$, with $\sim 10\%$ far UV flux variability between epochs. The contemporaneous X-ray and UV spectra can be modeled self-consistently in a thin disk framework. At observed epochs, the disk had an outer radius ($R_{\rm out}$) of $\mathcal{O}(10^3 R_{\rm g})$, and shows both cooling and expansion over the four years. Incorporating relativistic effects via numerical ray tracing, we constrain the disk inclination angle ($i$) to be $30^\circ \lesssim i \lesssim 65^\circ $ and identify a narrow region of spin-inclination parameter space that describes the observations. These findings confirm that GSN 069 hosts a compact, viscously expanding accretion disk likely formed after a TDE. Implications for QPE models are: (i) No published disk instability model can explain the disk's stability in 2014 (no QPEs) and its instability in 2018 (QPEs present); (ii) While the disk size in 2018 allows for orbiter/disk interactions to produce QPEs, in 2014 the disk was already sufficiently extended, yet no QPEs were present. These findings pose challenges to existing QPE models.","['M. Guolo', 'A. Mummery', 'T. Wevers', 'M. Nicholl', 'S. Gezari', 'A. Ingram', 'D. R.

Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope UV observations of an X-ray quasi-periodic eruption source,"X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} > 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).","['Thomas Wevers', 'Muryel Guolo', 'Sean Lockwood', 'Andrew Mummery', 'Dheeraj R.

Multi-Wavelength Analysis of AT 2023sva: a Luminous Orphan Afterglow With Evidence for a Structured Jet,"We present multi-wavelength analysis of ZTF23abelseb (AT 2023sva), an optically discovered fast-fading ($\Delta m_r = 2.2$ mag in $\Delta t = 0.74 $ days), luminous ($M_r \sim -30.0$ mag) and red ($g-r = 0.50$ mag) transient at $z = 2.28$ with accompanying luminous radio emission. AT 2023sva does not possess a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to an isotropic equivalent energy limit of $E_{\rm{\gamma, \, iso}} < 1.6 \times 10^{52}$ erg, determined through searching $\gamma$-ray satellite archives between the last non-detection and first detection, making it the sixth example of an optically-discovered afterglow with a redshift measurement and no detected GRB counterpart. We analyze AT 2023sva's optical, radio, and X-ray observations to characterize the source. From radio analyses, we find the clear presence of strong interstellar scintillation (ISS) 72 days after the initial explosion, allowing us to place constraints on the source's angular size and bulk Lorentz factor. When comparing the source sizes derived from ISS of orphan events to those of the classical GRB population, we find orphan events have statistically smaller source sizes. We also utilize Bayesian techniques to model the multi-wavelength afterglow. Within this framework, we find evidence that AT 2023sva possesses a shallow power-law structured jet viewed slightly off-axis ($\theta_{\rm{v}} = 0.07 \pm 0.02$) just outside of the jet's core opening angle ($\theta_{\rm{c}} = 0.06 \pm 0.02$). We determine this is likely the reason for the lack of a detected GRB counterpart, but also investigate other scenarios. AT 2023sva's evidence for possessing a structured jet stresses the importance of broadening orphan afterglow search strategies to a diverse range of GRB jet angular energy profiles, to maximize the return of future optical surveys.","['Gokul P.

HST Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS0745-191,"We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.","['Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo', 'Hyunseop Choi', 'Minghao Guo', 'Annabelle Richard-Laferrière', 'Carter Rhea', 'Marine Prunier', 'Helen Russell', 'Andy Fabian', 'Jonelle L.

Recent star formation episodes in the Galaxy: impact on its chemical properties and the evolution of its abundance gradient,"We investigate the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disc exploring various schemes of recent (last several Gyr) star formation episodes, as reported in recent observational works. We use a semi-analytical model with parametrized radial migration and we introduce gaussian star formation episodes constrained by those recent observations. We find significant impact of the star formation episodes on several observables, like the local age-metallicity and [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity relations, as well as the local stellar metallicity distribution or the existence of young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars. Moreover, we show that the recently found ""wiggly"" behaviour of the disk abundance gradient with age can be interpreted in terms of either star formation or infall episodes.","['Tianxiang Chen', 'Nikos Prantzos']",7.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03342,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Galaxy: evolution – Galaxy: disk 1'],2025-01-08
Formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes from rings of planetesimals,"The solar system planetary architecture has been proposed to be consistent with the terrestrial and giant planets forming from material rings at ~1 au and ~5 au, respectively. Here, we show that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes may share a similar formation pathway. In our simulations conducted with a disk alpha-viscosity of 4e-3, super-Earths accrete from rings of rocky material in the inner disk, growing predominantly via planetesimal accretion. Mini-Neptunes primarily originate from rings located beyond the water snowline, forming via pebble accretion. Our simulations broadly match the period-ratio distribution, the intra-system size uniformity, and the planet multiplicity distribution of exoplanets. The radius valley constrains the typical total mass available for rocky planet formation to be less than 3-6 Earth masses. Our results predict that planets at ~1 au in systems with close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are predominantly water-rich. Though relatively uncommon, at ~1% level, such systems might also host rocky Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone that underwent late giant impacts, akin to the Moon-forming event.","['Sho Shibata', 'Andre Izidoro']",16.0,22.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03345,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: formation — planets and satellites: terrestrial planets — planets and satellites: atmospheres — methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-08

Our preliminary results include: 1) the axes of MFRs in cycle 25 present a systematic northward orientation, which is the same as in cycle 23 but opposite to cycle 24; 2) the majority of the MFRs occurred near HBs (within 30 degrees) and some exceptional events occurred at non-HBs; 3) the axial fields in MCs present a similar north-south orientation, which changes from cycle to cycle.

Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL\,J2325$-$4111 and SPT-CL\,J0049$-$2440 were optimized using 9, and 8 secure multiple-imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0\farcs63 and 0\farcs73, respectively.

Bulk viscous matter in $f(T)$ gravity: A path to cosmic acceleration,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying bulk viscosity coefficients $\zeta(t)=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}H$ on cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We focus on two cases: (i) $\zeta_{1} \neq0$ and (ii) $\zeta_{1} =0$, deriving the Hubble parameter $H$ as a function of redshift $z$ using a linear $f(T)$ model ($f(T) = \alpha T$ where $\alpha \neq 0$). Using the combined $H(z)+Pantheon^{+}+BAO$ dataset, we obtain observational constraints on model parameters. For Case I ($\zeta_1 \neq 0$), best-fit values are $H_0=60.0^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=1.01^{+0.10}_{-0.098}$, $\zeta_0=40.1^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$, and $\zeta_1=0.123^{+0.093}_{-0.088}$, while for Case II ($\zeta_1 = 0$), they are $H_0=67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=0.94^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and $\zeta_0=34.7^{+2.0}_{-2.0}$. The analysis reveals a transition in the deceleration parameter, indicating a shift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe's expansion, with present-day values of $q_{0} \approx -0.49$ and $q_{0} \approx -0.32$ for the respective cases. The jerk parameter $j(z)$ and effective EoS for the cosmic viscous fluid also support the cosmic acceleration, with trajectories aligning with the quintessence scenario.

Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies,"We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($<3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($>$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.","['Thomas Donlon II', 'Sukanya Chakrabarti', 'Lawrence M.

The nature and origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous based on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio emission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars are detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores, knots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on morphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars as radio-AGN, compared to the $\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the $\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN and the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\sim$60 per cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is likely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no significant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2 quasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest jet powers of $P_\mathrm{jet} \approx \times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few targets, where these measurements were possible. These quasars share characteristics with compact radio-selected populations, and the global radio emission likely traces strong interactions between the AGN (jets/outflows) and their host galaxy ISM from 10s parsec to 10s kiloparsec scales.","['Ann Njeri', 'Chris M.

Strong evidence of low levels of solar activity during the Maunder Minimum,"The Maunder Minimum (MM) was a period of prolonged solar activity minimum between 1645 and 1715. Several works have identified a significant number of problematic spotless days in the MM included in existing databases. We have found a list of exact spotless (in the second half of 1709) and spot days (January and August 1709) provided by Johann Heinrich Muller. We computed the most probable value and upper/lower limits of the active day fraction (ADF) from Muller's data using the hypergeometrical probability distribution. Our sample is not strictly random because Muller recorded observations in consecutive days when he observed sunspots. Therefore, our result represents an upper threshold of solar activity for 1709. We compared this result with annual values of the ADF calculated for the Dalton Minimum and the most recent solar cycles. We concluded that it was less active than most years both in the Dalton Minimum and in the most recent solar cycles. Therefore, the solar activity level estimated in this work for 1709 represents robust evidence of low solar activity levels in the MM.","['V.M.S. Carrasco', 'H. Hayakawa', 'C. Kuroyanagi', 'M.C.

Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations,"We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.","['Mohammad Ali Gorji', 'Misao Sasaki', 'Teruaki Suyama']",3.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03444,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-08
Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?,"We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L>1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.","['Chan-Gyung Park', 'Bharat Ratra']",18.0,29.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03480,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-08
"The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation","We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.","['Z. Prudil', 'A. Kunder', 'L. Beraldo e Silva', 'S. Gough-Kelly', 'M.

The ubiquity of variable radio emission and spin-down rates in pulsars,"Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission stability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are identifying an increasing number that deviate from this preconceived notion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we investigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 radio pulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, over the past three decades. We found 238 pulsars display significant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit changes in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this represents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and indicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The intensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar spin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may have substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in the ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in explaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient profile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.","['M. E. Lower', 'A.

Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations,"Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple-lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple-source, and 8.8% have a multiple-lens and a multiple-source. The majority of these events have photometric lightcurves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens-binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for singles and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of singles and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE (arXiv:1707.07634) than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.","['Natasha S.

The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database,"We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys.

Real-time RFI Excision Techniques and their Limitations,"Contemporary real-time RFI mitigation is carried out at different stages primarily using regulatory and technical approaches. Regulatory approaches include spectrum management, radio quiet zones, and ensuring protection from self-generated RFI. The technical approaches include mitigation RFI in the analog and RF frontend systems, digital signal processing systems, and offline systems.As is known, the signal received by a radio telescope is a combination of the contributions from the astronomical signal and a combination of system and sky background noise. RFI has an additive effect on the signal received by the radio telescope. The key distinguishing properties of RFI are that it is generally stronger than the signal and non-Gaussian.The capability of signal processing receiver systems has grown manifold with the advent of high-speed signal processing platforms like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This has enabled the development of different signal-processing techniques for real-time RFI mitigation algorithms.

High Resolution {\it BOES} Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He~II$\lambda$6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae,"Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at $\sim$ 6545~Å. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from April 2019 to March 2020 using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph ({\it BOES}). Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered \ion{He}{2} at 6545~Å in NGC~6881 and NGC~6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC~6741 and NGC~6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the \ion{H}{1} component relative to the \ion{He}{2} emission region ranges from $26-33~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC~6881, NGC~6741, NGC~6886, and NGC~6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of \ion{H}{1} components with masses around $10^{-2}~M_\odot$, moving outward from the central \ion{He}{2} emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.","['Jin Lim', 'Seok-Jun Chang', 'Jaejin Shin', 'Hee-Won Lee', 'Jiyu Kim', 'Hak-Sub Kim', 'Bo-Eun Choi', 'Ho-Gyu Lee']",10.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03558,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Interdisciplinary astronomy(804) 1'],2025-01-08
Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions,"Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.",['Mehdi Yousefzadeh'],6.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03559,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,['Solar corona (1483 )'],2025-01-08
Spectro-timing analysis of Be X-ray pulsar SMC X-2 during the 2022 outburst,"We present broadband X-ray observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) pulsar SMC X-2, using concurrent NuSTAR and NICER observations during its 2022 outburst. The source is found to be spinning with a period of 2.37281(3) s. We confirm the existence of cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at 31 keV in addition to the iron emission line in the X-ray continuum of the source. Spectral analysis performed with the physical bulk and thermal Comptonization model indicates that the bulk Comptonization dominates the thermal Comptonization. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we have investigated the variations of the spectral parameters relative to pulse phase that may be due to the complex structure of magnetic field of the pulsar or the impact of the emission geometry. It is observed that the spectral parameters exhibit significant variabilities relative to the pulsed phase. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to examine the evolution of the continuum and changes in the spectral characteristics. Measurements of luminosity along with variations in cyclotron line energy and photon index suggest that the source may be accreting in the super-critical regime.","['Mohammed Tobrej', 'Binay Rai', 'Manoj Ghising', 'Ruchi Tamang', 'Bikash Chandra Paul']",9.0,20.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03576,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['neutron-pulsars', 'accretion discs-stars', 'SMC X-2 *Corresponding author E-mail: bcpaul@associates', 'X-ray binaries']",2025-01-08
Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts,"The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.",['Xin-Ying Song'],2.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03610,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Compact objects(288)'],2025-01-08
The joint detection rate of short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers,"In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the power-law delay model marginally preferred over the Gaussian and lognormal delay models based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $1.73_{-0.45}^{+0.60}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}).

The impact of mass uncertainties on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers,"Theoretical predictions of element yields from the rapid neutron capture (r-) process are subject to large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of matter ejection. A major source of uncertainty in determining ejecta composition and radioactive decay heat is the lack of nuclear mass data for exotic neutron-rich nuclei produced during neutron irradiation.We examine both model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and their impact on r-process nucleosynthesis, and consequently, the composition of neutron star merger ejecta. To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear mass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a backward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from local variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known masses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find that uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance uncertainties of 20% up to A $\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with peaks around A $\simeq$ 140 and A $\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of 100-300%. While correlated model uncertainties generally exceed parameter uncertainties for most nuclei, both have a significant impact on heavy element production.Overall, improvements in nuclear models are essential to reducing uncertainties in r-process predictions. Both correlated model uncertainties and coherent determination of parameter uncertainties are crucial for sensitivity analysis in r-process nucleosynthesis.","['S. Martinet', 'S.

$\Lambda$CDM Model Against Gravity-Thermodynamics Conjecture: Observational Constraints After DESI 2024,"In the context of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture based on the Tsallis entropy-area relation, we investigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and examine some potential deviations from it. Utilizing recent updates from geometrical datasets, including the DESI BAO measurements (2024), Planck CMB anisotropy measurements (2018), and the Pantheon+ catalogue for SNIa (2022), we conduct a thorough analysis via the window of Tsallis cosmology. In the first step, our analysis reveals no significant deviation from the standard model when using DESI BAO data alone, Pantheon+ data alone, or a combination of both. In the next step, we incorporate all datasets by adding the CMB data to our analysis, indicating a potential deviation from the standard model within the framework of Tsallis cosmology.

The fine-scale structure of polar coronal holes,"Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.","['Richard J.

Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5 $\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.","['Muriel Zoë Stiefel', 'Matej Kuhar', 'Olivier Limousin', 'Ewan C.M.

A cosmic degeneracy story: structure formation with warm dark matter and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities,"It has been recently shown that cosmological models with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) could provide a possible path to solve current cosmic tensions. Moreover, it has been pointed out that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) for several observables at low redshift. Here, we confirm the qualitative similarity of the matter power spectrum for sPNG and WDM models, but also point out differences in the halo mass function and void size function. We then jointly simulate WDM and sPNG together. Such simulations allow us to demonstrate that the joint impact of WDM and sPNG is close to the linear superposition of their respective effects at low redshift, at the percent level. We finally propose a model with mixed hot and cold dark matter together with sPNG, that reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum at redshifts $z \leq 3$ but is still distinct in terms of halo statistics.","['Clément Stahl', 'Benoit Famaey', 'Rodrigo Ibata', 'Katarina Kraljic', 'Fabien Castillo']",7.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03672,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-08
Effects of energetic particles produced by magnetic reconnection on discs of young stars,"T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.",['Valentin Brunn'],18.0,320.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03678,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena']",,,"['acceleration of particles – accretion', 'accretion discs – magnetic reconnection – stars: ﬂare']",2025-01-08
Characterizing WASP-43b's interior structure: unveiling tidal decay and apsidal motion,"Context. Recent developments in exoplanetary research highlight the importance of Love numbers in understanding their internal dynamics, formation, migration history and their potential habitability. Love numbers represent crucial parameters that gauge how exoplanets respond to external forces such as tidal interactions and rotational effects. By measuring these responses, we can gain insights into the internal structure, composition, and density distribution of exoplanets. The rate of apsidal precession of a planetary orbit is directly linked to the second-order fluid Love number, thus we can gain valuable insights into the mass distribution of the planet. Aims. In this context, we aim to re-determine the orbital parameters of WASP-43b-in particular, orbital period, eccentricity, and argument of the periastron-and its orbital evolution. We study the outcomes of the tidal interaction with the host star:whether tidal decay and periastron precession are occurring in the system. Method. We observed the system with HARPS, whose data we present for the first time, and we also analyse the newly acquired JWST full-phase light curve. We fit jointly archival and new radial velocity and transit and occultation mid-times, including tidal decay, periastron precession and long-term acceleration in the system. Results. We detected a tidal decay rate of \dotP_a=(-1.99pm0.50) and a periastron precession rate of \dotomega=(0.1851+0.0070-0.0077)=(0.1727+0.0083-0.0089)deg/d=(621.72+29.88-32.04)arcsec/d. This is the first time that both periastron precession and tidal decay are simultaneously detected in an exoplanetary system. The observed tidal interactions can neither be explained by the tidal contribution to apsidal motion of a non-aligned stellar or planetary rotation axis nor by assuming non-synchronous rotation for the planet, and a value for the planetary Love number cannot be derived.

Continuation of an Optical Spectroscopic Campaign of Fermi Blazar Candidates with TNG: Discovery of a New Changing-Look Blazar,"Context. Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gamma-ray blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are an ongoing challenge in gamma-ray astronomy due to difficulties in classification and redshift determination. Aims. This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at identifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift estimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We conducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21 low-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the literature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL J2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of them, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite previously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look blazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum. Additionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to inconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any redshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into the classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing the need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.","['N. Álvarez Crespo', 'A.

Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars,"Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.","['J. Sanz-Forcada', 'M. López-Puertas', 'M. Lampón', 'S. Czesla', 'L. Nortmann', 'J. A. Caballero', 'M. R.

Constraints on the properties of macroscopic transport in the Sun from combined lithium and beryllium depletion,"Context. The Sun is a privileged laboratory of stellar evolution, thanks to the quality and complementary nature of available constraints. Using these observations, we are able to draw a detailed picture of its internal structure and dynamics which form the basis of the successes of solar modelling. Amongst such constraints, the depletion of lithium and beryllium are key tracers of the required efficiency and extent of macroscopic mixing just below the solar convective envelope. Thanks to revised determinations of these abundances, we may use them in conjunction with other existing spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints to study in detail the properties of macroscopic transport. Aims. We aim at constraining the efficiency of macroscopic transport at the base of the convective envelope and determining the compatibility of the observations with a suggested candidate linked with the transport of angular momentum in the solar radiative interior. Methods. We use recent spectroscopic observations of lithium and beryllium abundance and include them in solar evolutionary model calibrations. We test the agreement of such models in terms of position of the convective envelope, helium mass fraction in convective zone, sound speed profile inversions and neutrino fluxes. Results. We constrain the required efficiency and extent of the macroscopic mixing at the base of the solar convective envelope, finding that a power law of density with an index n between 3 and 6 would reproduce the data, with efficiencies at the base of the envelope of about 6000 cm2 /s, depending on the value of n. We also confirm that macroscopic mixing worsens the agreement with neutrino fluxes and that the current implementations of the magnetic Tayler instability are unable to explain the observations.","['G.

Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars,"NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a much higher abundance of Classical Be stars (CBe) than typical open clusters. We perform a membership analysis using GAIA DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be 3.6 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc. We identify 499 GAIA-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.5 M$\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.2 %. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using standard deviation, median absolute deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66 % of CBe stars are variable: 23 % show periodic signals from pulsation or rotation, 41 \% exhibit variability from disk dynamics or binarity, and 14 % have long-term variations due to disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50 \% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50 % are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.","['Arghya Chakraborty', 'Jessy Jose', 'Alex C.

Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology,"In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy has become a topic of interest in cosmology. Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to {\Lambda}CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.","['Guandi Zhao', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Peng Wang', 'Ji Yao']",11.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03750,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-08
Conditions for radiative zones in the molecular hydrogen envelope of Jupiter and Saturn: The role of alkali metals,"Interior models of gas giants in the Solar System traditionally assume a fully convective molecular hydrogen envelope. However, recent observations from the Juno mission suggest a possible depletion of alkali metals in Jupiter's molecular hydrogen envelope, indicating that a stable radiative layer could exist at the kilobar level. Recent studies propose that deep stable layers help reconcile various Jupiter observations, including its atmospheric water and CO abundances and the depth of its zonal winds. However, opacity tables used to infer stable layers are often outdated and incomplete, leaving the precise molecular hydrogen envelope composition required for a deep radiative zone uncertain. In this paper, we determine atmospheric compositions that can lead to the formation of a radiative zone at the kilobar level in Jupiter and Saturn today. We computed radiative opacity tables covering pressures up to $10^5$ bar, including the most abundant molecules present in the gas giants of the Solar System, as well as contributions from free electrons, metal hydrides, oxides, and atomic species, using the most up-to-date line lists published in the literature. These tables were used to calculate Rosseland-mean opacities for the molecular hydrogen envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then compared to the critical mean opacity required to maintain convection. We find that the presence of a radiative zone is controlled by the existence of K, Na, and NaH in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. For Jupiter, the elemental abundance of K and Na must be less than $\sim 10^{-3}$ times solar to form a radiative zone. In contrast, for Saturn, the required abundance for K and Na is below $\sim 10^{-4}$ times solar.","['Louis Siebenaler', 'Yamila Miguel', 'Sam de Regt', 'Tristan Guillot']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03756,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,A&A,,['Planets and satellites: gaseous planets – Planets and satellites: atmospheres 1'],2025-01-08
High-frequency coronal Alfv\'enic waves observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP,"The presence and nature of low-frequency (0.1-10~mHz) Alfvénic waves in the corona has been established over the last decade, with many of these results coming from coronagraphic observations of the infrared Fe XIII line. The Cryo-NIRSP instrument situated at DKIST has recently begun acquiring science quality data of the same Fe XIII line, with at least a factor of 9 improvement in spatial resolution, a factor 30 increase in temporal resolution and an increase in signal-to-noise, when compared to the majority of previously available data. Here we present an analysis of 1~s cadence sit-and-stare data from Cryo-NIRSP, examining the Doppler velocity fluctuations associated with the Fe XIII 1074~nm coronal line. We are able to confirm previous results of Alfvénic waves in the corona as well as explore a new frequency regime. The data reveals that the power law behaviour of the Doppler velocity power spectrum extends to higher frequencies. This result appears to challenge some models of photospheric-driven Alfvénic waves that predict a lack of high frequency wave power in the corona due to strong chromospheric damping. Moreover, the high-frequency waves do not transport as much energy as their low-frequency counterparts, with less time-averaged energy per frequency interval. We are also able to confirm the incompressible nature of the fluctuations with little coherence between the line amplitude and Doppler velocity time-series.","['Richard J.

Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density observed in dark matter halos,"It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.",['Jorge Sanchez Almeida'],11.0,19.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03761,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,"""Galaxies""",,['Dark matter'],2025-01-08
Eclipsing binary systems with $\beta$ Cephei components. V1216 Sco,"We present a detailed analysis of the high-mass binary system V1216 Sco, an eclipsing Algol-type binary hosting a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator, with an orbital period of 3.92 days. This system was analyzed using TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy from SALT HRS to investigate its orbital parameters, stellar properties, and evolutionary history. The TESS light curve, comprising over 12000 data points, revealed five independent pulsation frequencies within the beta Cephei range of 5 to 7 d$^{-1}$.Spectroscopic analysis provided radial velocities and disentangled atmospheric parameters, enabling precise orbital and evolutionary modeling. The system features a primary star of 11.72 M$_{\odot}$ and a secondary of 4.34 M$_{\odot}$. The secondary star has a radius near its Roche lobe, indicating recent or ongoing mass transfer. Evolutionary modeling with MESA-binary suggests that V1216 Sco underwent a case A mass transfer scenario, where mass transfer began while the donor was still on the main sequence. The system's evolutionary models indicate an age of 15 to 30 million years, highlighting the significant impact of binary interactions on stellar evolution.This study underscores the value of combining observational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex systems like V1216 Sco, emphasizing the role of mass transfer in shaping binary star evolution.","['A.

Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data,"Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z<0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s.

The occurrence of powerful flares stronger than X10 class in Solar Cycles,"Solar flares stronger than X10 (S-flares, >X10) are the highest class flares which significantly impact on the Sun's evolution and space weather. Based on observations of Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) at soft X-ray (SXR) wavelength and the daily sunspot numbers (DSNs) since 1975, we obtained some interesting and heuristic conclusions: (1) Both S-flares and the more powerful extremely strong flares (ES-flares, >X14.3) mostly occur in the late phases of solar cycles and low-latitude regions on the solar disk; (2) Similar to X-class flares, the occurrence of S-flares in each solar cycle is somewhat random, but the occurrence of ES-flares seems to be dominated by the mean DSN (Vm) and its root-mean-square deviation during the valley phase (Vd) before the cycle: the ES-flare number is strongly correlated with Vd, and the occurrence time of the first ES-flare is anti-correlated with Vd and Vm. These facts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the more the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred. We proposed that the Sun may have a low-latitude active zone (LAZ), and most ES-flares are generated from the interaction between LAZ and the newly emerging active regions. The correlations and the linear regression functions may provide an useful method to predict the occurrence of ES-flares in an upcoming solar cycle, which derives that solar cycle 25 will have about 2 ES-flares after the spring of 2027.","['Baolin Tan', 'Yin Zhang', 'Jing Huang', 'Kaifan Ji']",4.0,10.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03791,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['solar ﬂares — sunspot number — solar cycle 1'],2025-01-08
Mixing by Internal Gravity Waves in Stars: Assessing Numerical Simulations Against Theory,"Here we present a study of radial chemical mixing in non-rotating massive main-sequence stars driven by internal gravity waves (IGWs), based on multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the fully compressible code MUSIC. We examine two proposed mechanisms of material mixing in stars by IGWs that are commonly quoted, relating to thermal diffusion and sub-wavelength shearing. Thermal diffusion provides a non-restorative effect to the waves, leaving material displaced from its previous equilibrium, while shearing arising within the waves drives weak localised flows, mixing the fluid there. Using IGW spectra from the simulations, we evaluate theoretical predictions of mixing rates due to these mechanisms. We show, for $20M_\odot$ main-sequence stars, that neither of these mechanisms are likely to create mixing sufficient to correct inaccuracies in current stellar evolution models. Furthermore, we compare these predictions to results obtained from Lagrangian tracer particles, following a method recently used for global simulations of stellar interiors to measure mixing by IGWs in their radiative zones. We demonstrate that tracer particle methods face significant numerical challenges in measuring the small diffusion coefficients predicted by the aforementioned theories, for which they are prone to yielding artificially enhanced coefficients. Diffusion coefficients based on such methods are currently used with stellar evolution codes for asteroseismic studies, but should be viewed with caution. Finally, in a case where tracer particles do not suffer from numerical artefacts, we suggest that a diffusion model is not suitable for timescales typically considered by two-dimensional numerical simulations.","['Jack Morton', 'Thomas Guillet', 'Isabelle Baraffe', 'Adrien Morison', 'Arthur Le Saux', 'Dimitar Vlaykov', 'Tom Goffrey', 'Jane Pratt']",13.0,18.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03796,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics – waves – stars: interiors – methods: numerical – asteroseismology – stars: evolution 1 INTRODUCTION Mixing through the stably stratified regions of stars is critical to their evolution'],2025-01-08
"TOI-5108 b and TOI 5786 b: Two transiting sub-Saturns detected and characterized with TESS, MaHPS and SOPHIE","We report the discovery and characterization of two sub-Saturns from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) using high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the MaHPS spectrograph at the Wendelstein Observatory and the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory. Combining photometry from TESS, KeplerCam, LCOGT, and MuSCAT2 with the radial velocity measurements from MaHPS and SOPHIE we measure precise radii and masses for both planets. TOI-5108 b is a sub-Saturn with a radius of $6.6 \pm 0.1$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $32 \pm 5$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-5786 b is similar to Saturn with a radius of $8.54 \pm 0.13$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $73 \pm 9$ $M_\oplus$. The host star for TOI-5108 b is a moderately bright (Vmag 9.75) G-type star. TOI-5786 is a slightly dimmer (Vmag 10.2) F-type star. Both planets are close to their host stars with periods of 6.75 days and 12.78 days respectively. This puts TOI-5108 b just inside the bounds of the Neptune desert while TOI-5786 b is right above the upper edge. We estimate hydrogen-helium envelope mass fractions of $38 \%$ for TOI-5108 b and $74 \% $ for TOI-5786 b. However, using a model for the interior structure that includes tidal effects the envelope fraction of TOI-5108 b could be much lower ($\sim 20\,\%$) depending on the obliquity. We estimate mass-loss rates between 1.0 * $10^9$ g/s and 9.8 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5108 b and between 3.6 * $10^8$ g/s and 3.5 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5786 b. Given their masses, this means that both planets are stable against photoevaporation. We also detect a transit signal for a second planet candidate in the TESS data of TOI-5786 with a period of 6.998 days and a radius of $3.83 \pm 0.16$ $R_\oplus$.

Dimming GRS 1915+105 observed with NICER and Insight--HXMT,"The black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 was bright for 26 years since its discovery and is well-known for its disk instabilities, quasi-periodic oscillations, and disk wind signatures. We report a long-term spectral-timing tracing of this source from mid-2017 until the onset of the ""obscured state"", based on the complete data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Insight--Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), whose hard coverage decisively informs the modeling at lower energies. In the soft state predating 2018, we observed highly ionized winds. However, in the hard state shortly before transitioning into the ""obscured state"" on May 14, 2019 (MJD 58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\log \xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the measurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the estimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of different spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We delve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard state. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay phase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism of those winds in both states is likely the same. The presence of the ionized winds is preferentially dependent on the periphery of the accretion disk, but not directly related to the corona activities in the center of the binary system.","['M.

High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam: New multi-band templates,"We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.","['K.

Demonstration of Ultra-Sensitive KIDs for Future THz Space Borne Polarimeters,"We present measurements and simulations of the polarization purity of leaky lens-antenna coupled microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) at 1.5 THz. We find the integrated cross-polarization level to be at -21.5 dB for 1 f\#$\lambda$ spatial sampling. The measurements agree well with the theoretical description which is based on a combination of in-transmission simulation of the antenna feed, and an in-reception analysis of the antenna-KID system.

Characterization of Markarian 421 during its most violent year: Multiwavelength variability and correlations,"Mrk 421 was in its most active state around early 2010, which led to the highest TeV gamma-ray flux ever recorded from any active galactic nuclei. We aim to characterize the multiwavelength behavior during this exceptional year for Mrk 421, and evaluate whether it is consistent with the picture derived with data from other less exceptional years. We investigated the period from November 5, 2009, (MJD 55140) until July 3, 2010, (MJD 55380) with extensive coverage from very-high-energy (VHE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$GeV) gamma rays to radio with MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, VLBA, and a variety of additional optical and radio telescopes. We investigated the variability and correlation behavior among different energy bands in great detail. We find the strongest variability in X-rays and VHE gamma rays, and PSDs compatible with power-law functions. We observe strong correlations between X-rays and VHE gamma rays. We also report a marginally significant positive correlation between high-energy (HE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$MeV) gamma rays and the ultraviolet band. We detected marginally significant correlations between the HE and VHE gamma rays, and between HE gamma rays and the X-ray, that disappear when the large flare in February 2010 is excluded from the correlation study. The activity of Mrk 421 also yielded the first ejection of features in the VLBA images of the jet of Mrk 421. Yet the large uncertainties in the ejection times of these radio features prevent us from firmly associating them to the specific flares recorded during the campaign. We also show that the collected multi-instrument data are consistent with a scenario where the emission is dominated by two regions, a compact and extended zone, which could be considered as a simplified implementation of an energy-stratified jet as suggested by recent IXPE observations.","['K.

"An absolute mass, precise age, and hints of planetary winds for WASP-121 A and b from a JWST NIRSpec phase curve","We have conducted a planetary radial velocity measurement of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b using JWST NIRSpec phase curve data. Our analysis reveals the Doppler shift of the planetary spectral lines across the full orbit, which shifts considerably across the detector ($\sim$ 10 pixels). Using cross-correlation techniques, we have determined an overall planetary velocity amplitude of $K_{\rm p}=215.7\pm1.1$ km/s, which is in good agreement with the expected value. We have also calculated the dynamical mass for both components of the system by treating it as an eclipsing double-line spectroscopic binary, with WASP-121A having a mass of M$_{\star}$=1.330 $\pm$ 0.019 M$_{\odot}$, while WASP-121b has a mass of M$_{\rm p}$= 1.170 $\pm$ 0.043 M$_{\rm Jup}$. These dynamical measurements are $\sim3\times$ more precise than previous estimates and do not rely on any stellar modeling assumptions which have a $\sim$5\% systematic floor mass uncertainty. Additionally, we used stellar evolution modeling constrained with a stellar density and parallax measurement to determine a precise age for the system, found to be 1.11 $\pm$ 0.14 Gyr. Finally, we observed potential velocity differences between the two NIRSpec detectors, with NRS1 lower by 5.5$\pm$2.2 km/s. We suggest that differences can arise from day/night asymmetries in the thermal emission, which can lead to a sensitivity bias favoring the illuminated side of the planet, with planetary rotation and winds both acting to lower a measured $K_{\rm P}$. The planet's rotation can account for 1 km/s of the observed velocity difference, with 4.5$\pm$2.2 km/s potentially attributable to vertical differences in wind speeds.","['David K. Sing', 'Thomas M.

"Computational Astrophysics, Data Science & AI/ML in Astronomy: A Perspective from Indian Community","In contemporary astronomy and astrophysics (A&A), the integration of high-performance computing (HPC), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) has become essential for advancing research across a wide range of scientific domains. These tools are playing an increasingly pivotal role in accelerating discoveries, simulating complex astrophysical phenomena, and analyzing vast amounts of observational data. For India to maintain and enhance its competitive edge in the global landscape of computational astrophysics and data science, it is crucial for the Indian A&A community to fully embrace these transformative technologies. Despite limited resources, the expanding Indian community has already made significant scientific contributions. However, to remain globally competitive in the coming years, it is vital to establish a robust national framework that provides researchers with reliable access to state-of-the-art computational resources. This system should involve the regular solicitation of computational proposals, which can be assessed by domain experts and HPC specialists, ensuring that high-impact research receives the necessary support. By building such a system, India can cultivate the talent, infrastructure, and collaborative environment necessary to foster world-class research in computational astrophysics and data science.","['Prateek Sharma', 'Bhargav Vaidya', 'Yogesh Wadadekar', 'Jasjeet Bagla', 'Piyali Chatterjee', 'Shravan Hanasoge', 'Prayush Kumar', 'Dipanjan Mukherjee', 'Ninan Sajeeth Philip', 'Nishant Singh']",14.0,21.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03876,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,The Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy,,['High Performance Computing — AI /ML in Astronomy — Indian Astronomy 1'],2025-01-08
Cosmic-ray acceleration and escape from supernova remnant W44 as probed by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,"Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W44 and its surroundings are a prime target for studying the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Several previous studies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the radio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped high-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex. Aims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the spatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the results of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the northwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to explain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We first performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at energies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while we set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a likelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial information obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive constraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the particle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data suggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We propose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect and explain the gamma-ray emission.","['S. Abe', 'J. Abhir', 'A. Abhishek', 'V.A. Acciari', 'A. Aguasca-Cabot', 'I.

Polarization aberrations in next-generation Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs). II. Influence of segment-to-segment coating variations on high-contrast imaging and polarimetry,"Direct exo-Earth imaging is a key science goal for astronomy in the next decade. This ambitious task imposes a target contrast of ~10^-7 at wavelengths from I to J-band. In our prior study, we determined that polarization aberrations can limit the achievable contrast to 10^-5 to 10^-6 in the infrared. However, these results assumed a perfect coronagraph coupled to a telescope with an ideal coating on each of the mirrors. In this study we seek to understand the influence of polarization aberrations from segment-to-segment coating variations on coronagraphy and polarimetry. We use the Poke open-source polarization ray tracing package to compute the Jones pupil of each GSMT with spatially-varying coatings applied to the segments. The influence of the resultant polarization aberrations is simulated by propagating the Jones pupil through physical optics models of coronagraphs using HCIPy. After applying wavefront control from an ideal adaptive optics system, we determine that the segment-to-segment variations applied limit the performance of coronagraphy to a raw contrast of approximately 10^-8 in I-band, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower the target performance for high-contrast imaging systems on the ground. This is a negligible addition to the nominal polarization aberrations for ground-based systems. We further observe negligible degradation in polarimetric imaging of debris disks from segment-to-segment aberrations above and beyond the impact of nominal polarization aberration.","['Jaren N.

ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk,"The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28"" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and faster acceleration going toward the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at 55, 67 and 86 au from the star, coincident with regions of enhanced gas density in the disk. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted in rings of enhanced gas density could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.","['F.

Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference,"We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.","['Nicolas Mediato-Diaz', 'Will Handley']",7.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03921,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability', 'Machine Learning']",,,"['CMB power spectrum I', 'cosmology', 'simulation-based inference', 'Bayesian data analysis']",2025-01-08
Eruptive YSOs in Cygnus-X: a mid-infrared variability study with NEOWISE and SPICY,"The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.","['C. Morris', 'Z. Guo', 'P. W. Lucas', 'N. Miller', 'C. Contreras Peña', 'M. A.

Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal,"Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.","['Ariel Scolnic', 'Ealeal Bear', 'Noam Soker']",4.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03947,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Stars: jets'],2025-01-08
A novel experimental approach to uncover the nature of cosmic-ray Deuterium,"Studying the isotopic composition of cosmic-rays (CRs) provides crucial insights into the galactic environment and helps improve existing propagation models. Special attention is given to the secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components in CRs, as these measurements can offer complementary data compared to traditional secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Recently, a precision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV rigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess of D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new measurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether there is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin. While there are theoretical models that attempt to explain this excess, the experimental uncertainties on D production cross-sections and on CR propagation models remain significant, and only new and precise measurements can dissipate existing doubts. In this work we review the current experimental scenario and we propose a dedicated experiment able to extend the D abundance measurement up to 100 GeV/nucl without the need of a magnetic spectrometer, using a multiple scattering based technique for the measurement of particle momentum. The expected performances of the proposed detector were assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, and its role in the current particle physics scenario is discussed.","['Francesco Dimiccoli', 'Francesco Maria Follega']",10.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03966,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-08
Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: II. AGN feedback,"We investigate AGN feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, our simulations focus on comparing stellar-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited non-negligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.","['R.

Tracing the Winds: A Uniform Interpretation of Helium Escape in Exoplanets from Archival Spectroscopic Observations,"Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density ($F_{\text{XUV}}/\rho_p$), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to $0.34 \pm 0.13$ and $0.75 \pm 0.21$ for hydrogen-helium fractions of $0.90$ and $0.99$, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.","['Patrick McCreery', 'Leonardo A.

Many-body atomic response functions of xenon and germanium for leading-order sub-GeV dark matter-electron interactions in effective field theory,"Direct searches of dark matter candidates with mass energies less than 1 GeV is an active research field. The energy depositions are comparable to the scale of atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems, therefore many-body physics plays an important role in understanding the detector's response in dark matter scattering. We present in this work a comprehensive data set of atomic response functions for xenon and germanium with 12.2 and 80 eV energy thresholds, respectively, using the (multiconfiguration) relativistic random phase approximation. This approach takes into account the relativistic, exchange, and correlation effects in one self-consistent framework, and is benchmarked successfully by photoabsorption data from thresholds to 30 keV with $\lesssim5\%$ errors. Comparisons with our previous and some other independent particle approaches in literature are made. It is also found that the spin-dependent (SD) response has significant difference from the spin-independent (SI) one such that the dark matter SD and SI interactions with electrons can be distinguished in unpolarized scattering, which is typical for direct search detectors. Finally, the exclusion limits set by current experiments are updated with our new results.","['C.-P. Liu', 'Mukesh K.

A trailing lognormal approximation of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations at $2.2\leq z\leq 2.7$,"Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasar spectra with upcoming surveys are expected to provide significantly larger and higher-quality datasets. To interpret these datasets, it is imperative to develop efficient simulations. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. We know from our previous work that while scaling the linear density contrast by parameter $\nu$ can recover the thermal parameters within $\sim 1-\sigma$ of best-fit values, the recovery of $\Gamma_{12}$ remains discrepant at $\gtrsim 3-\sigma$ for $z > 2.2$. Keeping this in mind, we extend our earlier work to improve the lognormal model of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, particularly the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), between $2.2 \leq z \leq 2.7$, by simulating the model spectra at a slightly lower redshift than the Sherwood smooth particle hydrodynamical simulations (SPH) data. The recovery of thermal parameters, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$) and the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$) is also alleviated. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities tend to over-predict the number of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers seen in SPH simulation. A lognormal model simulated at a lower redshift than SPH data can address this limitation to a certain extent. We show that with such a ""trailing"" model of lognormal distribution, values of $\Gamma_{12}$ are recovered at $\lesssim 1-\sigma$. We argue that this model can be useful for constraining cosmological parameters.",['Bhaskar Arya'],6.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04055,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['intergalactic media', 'power spectrumarXiv:2501', 'Lyman- αforest']",2025-01-09
Milky Way dynamics in light of Gaia,"The Gaia mission has triggered major developments in the field of Galactic dynamics in recent years, which we discuss in this review. The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components - disc, bar/bulge and halo - are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.","['Jason A.

zELDA II: reconstruction of galactic Lyman-alpha spectra attenuated by the intergalactic medium using neural networks,"The observed Lyman-Alpha (Lya) line profile is a convolution of the complex Lya radiative transfer taking place in the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, and IGM, respectively). Discerning the different components of the Lya line is crucial in order to use it as a probe of galaxy formation or the evolution of the IGM. We present the second version of zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters), an open-source Python module focused on modeling and fitting observed Lya line profiles. This new version of zELDA focuses on disentangling the galactic from the IGM effects. We build realistic Lya line profiles that include the ISM and IGM contributions, by combining the Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations for the so called ""shell model"" (ISM) and IGM transmission curves generated from IllustrisTNG100. We use these mock line profiles to train different artificial neural networks. These use as input the observed spectrum and output the outflow parameters of the best fitting ""shell model"" along with the redshift and Lya emission IGM escape fraction of the source. We measure the accuracy of zELDA on mock Lya line profiles. We find that zELDA is capable of reconstructing the ISM emerging Lya line profile with high accuracy (Kolmogorov-Smirnov<0.1) for 95% of the cases for HST COS-like observations and 80% for MUSE-WIDE-like. zELDA is able to measure the IGM transmission with the typical uncertainties below 10% for HST-COS and MUSE-WIDE data. This work represents a step forward in the high-precision reconstruction of IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. zELDA allows the disentanglement of the galactic and IGM contribution shaping the Lya line shape, and thus allows us to use Lya as a tool to study galaxy and ISM evolution.","['Siddhartha Gurung-Lopez', 'Chris Byrohl', 'Max Gronke', 'Daniele Spinoso', 'Alberto Torralba', 'Alberto Fernandez-Soto', 'Pablo Arnalte-Mur', 'Vicent J.

Structural Parameters of the Thin Disk Population from Evolved Stars in Solar Neighborhood,"This study investigates the structural parameters of the thin-disk population by analyzing the spatial distribution of evolved stars in the solar neighbourhood. From the $\it Gaia$ Data Release 3 database, about 39.1 million stars within 1 kpc and with relative parallax errors $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.10$ were selected. The photometric data was corrected for extinction using a Galactic dust map. The sample was refined by considering the color-magnitude region $M_{\rm G}\times (G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ associated with evolved stars, applying a stricter parallax error limit of $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.02$, and yielding 671,600 stars. The star sample was divided into 36 regions based on their Galactic coordinates, with evolved stars in the absolute magnitude range of $-1< M_{\rm G}~{\rm (mag)}\leq 4$ further split into five one-unit magnitude intervals. This led to 180 subgroups whose space density profiles were modelled using a single-component Galaxy model. The analysis shows that the space densities are in agreement with the literature and that the scale heights vary with $200<H~{\rm (pc)}<600$ interval to their absolute magnitudes. Red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood were also estimated to have a scale height of $295\pm10$ pc. These findings indicate that evolved stars with bright absolute magnitudes originate from the evolution of the early spectral-type stars with short scale height, while fainter ones come from the evolution of the intermediate spectral-type stars with large scale height, suggesting variations in scale height reflect the contribution of Galactic evolution processes.","['S.

Toward early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: IV. Physical properties of three detached O/B-type systems in the LMC,"We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O-C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple and, tentatively, a quadruple. A significant non-linear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M$_\odot$ to 22.1 M$_\odot$, radii from 7.0 R$_\odot$ to 14.2 R$_\odot$, and temperatures between 22500 K and 36000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M$_\odot$ to 23 M$_\odot$. A new mass-luminosity relation for O and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.","['Mónica Taormina', 'G. Pietrzyński', 'R.-P.

Galaxy cluster characterization with machine learning techniques,"We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the galaxy cluster population in the z=0 snapshot of the IllustrisTNG simulations, utilizing machine learning techniques to perform clustering and regression tasks. We examine five properties of the hot gas (the central cooling time, the central electron density, the central entropy excess, the concentration parameter, and the cuspiness) which are commonly used as classification metrics to identify cool core (CC), weak cool core (WCC) and non cool core (NCC) clusters of galaxies. Using mock Chandra X-ray images as inputs, we first explore an unsupervised clustering scheme to see how the resulting groups correlate with the CC/WCC/NCC classification based on the different criteria. We observe that the groups replicate almost exactly the separation of the galaxy cluster images when classifying them based on the concentration parameter. We then move on to a regression task, utilizing a ResNet model to predict the value of all five properties. The network is able to achieve a mean percentage error of 1.8% for the central cooling time, and a balanced accuracy of 0.83 on the concentration parameter, making them the best-performing metrics. Finally, we use simulation-based inference (SBI) to extract posterior distributions for the network predictions. Our neural network simultaneously predicts all five classification metrics using only mock Chandra X-ray images.This study demonstrates that machine learning is a viable approach for analyzing and classifying the large galaxy cluster datasets that will soon become available through current and upcoming X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA.","['Maria Sadikov', 'Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo', 'Laurence Perreault Levasseur', 'Carter Lee Rhea', 'Michael McDonald', 'Michelle Ntampaka', 'John ZuHone']",20.0,23.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04081,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,"['machine learning', 'simulations 1', 'X-rays', 'galaxy clusters']",2025-01-09
Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries,"Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, final rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and ""other"" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb \approx Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb \approx 7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.","['Marshall Hobson-Ritz', 'Jessica Birky', 'Leah Peterson', 'Peter Gwartney', 'Rachel Wong', 'John Delker', 'Tyler Gordon', 'Samantha Gilbert', 'James R.

Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys,"When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.","['Hao-Zhu Fu', 'Subo Dong']",9.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04083,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['planets and satellites: general — planets and satellites: detection — gravita- tional lensing: micro 1 INTRODUCTION A planet gravitationally unbound to any host stars can be detected in a short-duration ( <1d) microlens- ing event'],2025-01-09
Effects of galactic environment on size and dark matter content in low-mass galaxies,"We utilize the cosmological volume simulation, FIREbox, to investigate how a galaxy's environment influences its size and dark matter content. Our study focuses on approximately 1,200 galaxies (886 central and 332 satellite halos) in the low-mass regime, with stellar masses between $10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We analyze the size-mass relation ($r_{50} - M_{\star}$), inner dark matter mass-stellar mass ($M^{50}_{\rm DM} - M_{\star}$) relation, and the halo mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm halo} - M_{\star}$) relation. At fixed stellar mass, we find the galaxies experiencing stronger tidal influences, indicated by higher Perturbation Indices (PI $>$ 1) are generally larger and have lower masses relative to their counterparts with lower Perturbation Indices (PI $<$ 1). Applying a Random Forest regression model, we show that both the environment (PI) and halo mass ($M_{rm halo}$) are significant predictors of a galaxy's relative size and dark matter content. Notably, because $M_{\rm halo}$ is also strongly affected by the environment, our findings indicate that environmental conditions not only influence galactic sizes and relative inner dark matter content directly, but also indirectly through their impact on halo mass. Our results highlight a critical interplay between environmental factors and halo mass in shaping galaxy properties, affirming the environment as a fundamental driver in galaxy formation and evolution.","['Francisco J.

CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers ``First Light"" and ``Galaxy Assembly,"" including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z >~ 10 from ~90 arcmin^2 of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of >1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6<z<10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z>3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility.

Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp,"We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV>0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a ""bump"" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.","['Subhash Bose', 'Maximilian D.

Accretion disc winds imprint distinct signatures in the optical variability spectrum of black hole transients,"Quantifying the variability, measured as the root mean square (rms), of accreting systems as a function of energy is a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of these objects. Here, we present the first application of this method to optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries. We use high-time-resolution data of the black hole transient V404 Cygni, obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} during its 2015 outburst. During this event, conspicuous wind-related features, such as P-Cygni profiles, were detected in the flux spectra. We find that rms spectra are rich in spectral features, although they are typically morphologically different from their flux counterparts. Specifically, we typically observe absorption components in correspondence to the presence of emission lines in the flux spectra. Similarly, when analysing segments with significant variability in the optical flux, P-Cygni line profiles appear inverted in the rms spectra (i.e., enhanced variability in the blue-shifted region, accompanied by a decrease in that associated with the red component). We discuss the possible origin of these features, which resemble those found in other objects, such as active galactic nuclei. Finally, we highlight the potential of this technique for future searches for wind-type outflows in accreting compact objects.","['F. M. Vincentelli', 'T.

Signs of `Everything Everywhere All At Once' formation in low surface brightness globular cluster-rich dwarf galaxies,"Only two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have spatially resolved stellar population properties, both showing radially flat-to-rising metallicity profiles, indicative of a different formation pathway to most dwarf galaxies. The scarcity of other low surface brightness (LSB) dwarfs with a similar analysis prevents a deeper understanding on this behaviour. We investigate the radial profiles of the ages, metallicities and star formation histories of four globular cluster (GC) rich LSB dwarfs, newly observed within the 'Analysis of Galaxies At The Extremes' (AGATE) collaboration. DFX1 and DF07 are bona-fide UDGs, while PUDG-R27 and VCC1448 are nearly UDGs (NUDGes). Comparing their and DF44's results to simulations, we aim to reveal their formation pathways. We use pPXF to fit different spectra extracted in annular apertures to recover the stellar population properties and compute their gradients. We compare those with a sample of literature classical dwarfs and simulations, in particular with simulated UDGs. Our five LSB dwarfs present flat age and flat-to-rising metallicity profiles. The flat age gradients are compatible with those of classical dwarfs (both observed and from cosmological simulations), but the metallicity gradient diverges. All of our LSB dwarfs (except for PUDG-R27, showing a pronounced increasing metallicity profile) are compatible with being the extreme tail of the age-metallicity gradient relation, with a preference to co-eval formation forming the galaxy all at once. This sample of GC-rich LSB dwarfs with spatially resolved properties confirms that they seem to follow a different formation path than classical dwarfs. However, larger samples with higher S/N spectra and varying amounts of GC richness are required to set robust constraints on the formation pathways of LSB dwarf galaxies.","['Anna Ferré-Mateu', 'Jonah Gannon', 'Duncan A.

"Streams, Shells, and Substructures in the Accretion-Built Stellar Halo of NGC 300","We present deep optical observations of the stellar halo of NGC 300, an LMC-mass galaxy, acquired with the DEEP sub-component of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) using the 4 m Blanco Telescope. Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream ($M_{V}\sim-8.5$; [Fe/H] $= -1.4\pm0.15$) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately $1:15$. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster ($R_{\rm{proj}}=23.3$~kpc; $M_{V}=-8.99\pm0.16$; [Fe/H] $\approx-1.6\pm0.6$) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified globular cluster associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.","['Catherine E.

Dissipation and particle acceleration in astrophysical jets with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink Instabilities,"We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.","['Tsun Hin Navin Tsung', 'Gregory R.

The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: Deep Fields Data Release 2. I. The ELAIS-N1 field,"We present the final 6'' resolution data release of the ELAIS-N1 field from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields project (LoTSS Deep). The 144MHz images are the most sensitive achieved to date at this frequency and were created from 290 TB of data obtained from 505 hrs on-source observations taken over 7.5 years. The data were processed following the strategies developed for previous LoTSS and LoTSS Deep data releases. The resulting images span 24.53 square degrees and, using a refined source detection approach, we identified 154,952 radio sources formed from 182,184 Gaussian components within this area. The maps reach a noise level of 10.7 $\mu$Jy/beam at 6'' resolution where approximately half of the noise is due to source confusion. In about 7.4% of the image our limited dynamic range around bright sources results in a further > 5% increase in the noise. The images have a flux density scale accuracy of about 9% and the standard deviation of offsets between our source positions and those from Pan-STARRS is 0.2'' in RA and Dec for high significance detections. We searched individual epoch images for variable sources, identifying 39 objects with considerable variation. We also searched for circularly polarised sources achieving three detections of previously known emitters (two stars and one pulsar) whilst constraining the typical polarisation fraction plus leakage to be less than 0.045%.","['T.

The angular momentum spiral of the Milky Way disc in Gaia,"Data from the Gaia mission shows prominent phase-space spirals that are the signatures of disequilibrium in the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the phase-space spiral in angular momentum (AM) space. Using Gaia DR3, we detect a prominent AM spiral in the solar neighbourhood. We demonstrate the relation of AM to the $z-v_z$ spiral and show that we can map to this space from angular momentum through simplifying assumptions. By modelling the orbit of stars in AM, we develop a generative model for the spiral where the disc is perturbed by a bulk tilt at an earlier time. Our model successfully describes the salient features of the AM spiral in the data. Modelling the phase spiral in AM is a promising method to constrain both perturbation and MW potential parameters. Our AM framework simplifies the interpretation of the spiral and offers a robust approach to modelling disequilibrium in the MW disc using all six dimensions of phase space simultaneously.","['Rashid Yaaqib', 'Aneesh P.

Non-stop Variability of Sgr A* using JWST at 2.1 and 4.8 micron Wavelengths: Evidence for Distinct Populations of Faint and Bright Variable Emission,"We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.","['F.

Revisiting the Classics: On the Statistics of Dust Formation in Novae,"While nova eruptions produce some of the most common and dramatic dust formation episodes among astrophysical transients, the demographics of dust-forming novae remain poorly understood. Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 < 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak. The significant fraction of novae that form dust make them ideal laboratories in our Galactic backyard to tackle the puzzle of dust formation around explosive transients.","['Atticus Chong', 'Elias Aydi', 'Peter Craig', 'Laura Chomiuk', 'Ashley Stone', 'Jay Strader', 'Adam Kawash', 'Kirill V.

VLTI/GRAVITY enables the determination of the first dynamical masses of a classical Be + stripped and bloated pre-subdwarf binary,"HR~6819 is the first post-mass transfer binary system composed of a classical Be star and a bloated pre-subdwarf stripped star directly confirmed by interferometry. While the Be star is already spun up to near-critical rotation and possesses a self-ejected viscous Keplerian disk, the stripped star is found in a short-lived evolutionary stage, in which it retains the spectral appearance of a B-type main-sequence star while contracting into a faint subdwarf OB-type star. In order to understand the evolution of intermediate-mass interacting binaries, the fundamental parameters of cornerstone objects such as HR~6819 need to be known. We aim to obtain orbital parameters and model-independent dynamical masses of this binary system to quantitatively characterize this rarely observed evolutionary stage. We analyzed a time series of 12 interferometric near-IR $K$-band observations from VLTI/GRAVITY with the help of the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. We included recently published radial velocities based on FEROS high-resolution spectroscopy for the binary orbital solution. With the GRAVITY data, we obtained the astrometric orbit, relative fluxes of the components, and parameters of the circumstellar disk of the Be star; we also detected helium line signatures from the stripped star. Using the published radial velocities enabled us to obtain the dynamical masses of the components as well as the dynamical parallax. The Be star is the slightly brighter component in the $K$ band and is almost 16 times as massive as the bloated stripped star, with the individual dynamical masses being $4.24\pm0.31 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the Be star and $0.270\pm0.056 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the stripped star. The orbit is slightly eccentric, with $e=0.0289\pm0.0058$, and the semimajor axis of the orbit is $0.3800\pm0.0093$ AU. (Abstract continues but does not fit here)","['R. Klement', 'Th. Rivinius', 'D.

\texttt{Pz Cats}: Photometric redshift catalogs based on DES Y3 BAO sample,"The photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has been developed over the years with various methods. In this work, we analyse four different photo-z estimators using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample: \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF}. Unlike what is usually found in the literature, we investigate the possibility of selecting the best galaxies according to their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF). We selected 25,760 galaxies from four different spectroscopic surveys and cross-matched them with the photo-z sample. These galaxies served to understand the redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. We found that within a range of $0.79<z_p<0.85$ there is the lowest $\sigma$ for all the estimators we analysed. \texttt{DNF} has the biggest absolute value of the bias ($\sigma$), while \texttt{ENF}, \texttt{ANNz2} and \texttt{BPZ} lose precision for a redshift range below 0.7 and higher than 0.9. If one wants to pick the best galaxies by removing the bins with the worst bias, one will find that \texttt{ANNz2} is the most robust algorithm for all chosen criteria. When selecting the best PDFs, the resulting sub-samples gave \texttt{BPZ} with more selected objects. \texttt{ANNz2} shows better precision, \texttt{ENF} has the worst selection of Gaussian PDFs, with very few galaxies left for an LSS study. We also showed that even though the PDFs are smooth, there are catastrophic redshift results. Lastly, \texttt{DNF} is the worst in precision but with sufficient galaxies for cosmological analysis. We also selected galaxies whose PDFs have only secondary peaks not bigger than 30\% of the main peak height, called Small Peaks. For these sub-samples, \texttt{ANNz2} outperformed the other algorithms. We will make all catalogs publicly available through the package \texttt{Pz Cats}.","['Paula S. Ferreira', 'Ribamar R. R.

The Effects of Magneto-Convection on Short Period Cataclysmic Variables,"Many of the current problems related to the evolution of cataclysmic variables revolve around the magnetic nature of the main sequence secondary. It is known that magnetic fields alter the structure of low mass stars. In particular, they inhibit convection, leading to inflated radii. Here we present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of magneto-convection on the evolution of short period cataclysmic variables. We find that the inclusion of magneto-convection leads to larger secondaries, longer orbital periods and smaller mass-loss rates. When including magnetic effects, the minimum orbital period is increased by 14 minutes, indicating that this could help alleviate the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variable evolution. We also examine the effect of the white dwarf mass on the minimum period. While increasing the white dwarf mass does increase the minimum period, it is not substantial. Therefore it is unlikely that the period minimum problem can be solved with a larger white dwarf mass or with mass growth of white dwarf.","['Conor M.

Detecting rotation from lensing in the CMB,"An excellent estimate of the lensing signal is expected from the availability of deep and high-resolution polarization data in the near future. This is most important to allow for efficient delensing, needed to detect the primordial B-mode power and with it the famous tensor-to-scalar ratio. Here we discuss in a joint manner estimators of the rotation of polarization, of the second order lensing field rotation, and standard gradient lensing reconstruction. All are most efficient when able to probe the EB power created locally, have comparable reconstruction noise in this regime, and can benefit substantially from delensing. We discuss several ongoing and planned CMB experiments. We determine their noise for lensing field rotation and polarization rotation and discuss their prospects for measuring these effects. There is an on-going controversy on whether the lensing field rotation also rotates the polarization -- if so this will be observed at high significance soon with already on going observations of the South Pole Telescope, SPT-3G, in cross-correlation with tracers of large scale structure, as we show in this paper.","['Julien Carron', 'Enea di Dio', 'Ruth Durrer']",8.0,20.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04158,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-09
Revisiting The Cosmological Time Dilation of Distant Quasars: Influence of Source Properties and Evolution,"After decades of searching, cosmological time dilation was recently identified in the timescale of variability seen in distant quasars. Here, we expand on the previous analysis to disentangle this cosmological signal from the influence of the properties of the source population, specifically the quasar bolometric luminosity and the rest-frame emission wavelength at which the variability was observed. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence of the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time. We find that a significant intrinsic scatter of 0.288 +- 0.021 dex in the variability timescales, which was not considered in the previous analysis, is favoured by the data. This slightly increases the uncertainty in the results. However, the expected cosmological dependence of the variability timescales is confirmed to be robust to changes in the underlying assumptions. We find that the variability timescales increase smoothly with both wavelength and bolometric luminosity, and that black hole mass has no effect on the variability timescale once rest wavelength and bolometric luminosity are accounted for. Moreover, if the standard cosmological model is correct, governed by relativistic expansion, we also find very little cosmological evolution in the intrinsic variability timescales of distant quasars.","['Brendon J.

eRO-ExTra: eROSITA extragalactic non-AGN X-ray transients and variables in eRASS1 and eRASS2,"(Abridged) While previous X-ray studies showed the dominance of regular active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability, a small fraction of sources arise from more exotic phenomena such as tidal disruption events (TDEs), quasi-periodic eruptions, or other short-lived events associated with supermassive black hole accretion. This paper describes the systematic selection of X-ray extragalactic transients found in the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS) that are not associated with known AGN prior to eROSITA observations. We generated a variability sample from eRASS1 and eRASS2 (Dec. 2019-Dec. 2020), which includes sources with a variability significance and a fractional amplitude larger than four, located in the Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) footprint. The properties of LS10 counterparts were used to exclude stars and known AGN. The sample was additionally cleaned using pre-eROSITA classifications, archival optical spectra, and archival X-ray data. The final catalog eRO-ExTra includes 304 extragalactic eROSITA transients and variables not associated with known AGN. More than 90% of sources have reliable LS10 optical counterparts. For each source, we provide archival X-ray data from Swift, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton; the eROSITA long-term light curve (2-2.5 years) with a light curve classification; as well as the best power law fit spectral results at the peak eROSITA epoch. Reliable spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are provided for more than 80% of the sample. Several sources in the catalog are known TDE candidates discovered by eROSITA. In addition, 31 sources are radio detected. The eRO-ExTra transients constitute a relatively clean parent sample of non-AGN variability phenomena associated with massive black holes. More than 95% of eRO-ExTra sources were discovered in X-rays with eROSITA for the first time, which makes it a valuable resource for studying unique nuclear transients.","['Iuliia Grotova', 'Arne Rau', 'Mara Salvato', 'Johannes Buchner', 'Adelle J.

TransientVerse: A Comprehensive Real-Time Alert and Multi-Wavelength Analysis System for Transient Astronomical Events,"Transient astrophysical events are characterized by short timescales, high energy, and multi-wavelength radiation, often accompanied by violent energy releases. These phenomena are a major focus of modern astronomical research. To reveal their underlying physical mechanisms, near-real-time, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger follow-up observations are essential. However, current transient alert systems face multiple challenges, including fragmented messages, inconsistent formats, and difficulties in retrospective analysis, all of which hinder the efficiency of triggering observations. This paper presents \textbf{TransientVerse}, an innovative real-time database platform to integrate and disseminate transient alerts. The platform uses an automated pipeline to integrate real-time alerts from multiple sources (e.g., ATel, VOEvent, and GCN). It structures unstructured text data into a dual-format database for transient alerts by using open-source large language models. TransientVerse offers retrospective searches, data visualization, literature reviews, and customized subscriptions for efficient event tracking and analysis. Additionally, for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), the platform provides real-time statistics on repeat burst rates across different time intervals and alerts astronomers about high-frequency burst sources, enabling rapid follow-up observations and optimizing the use of limited observation windows. TransientVerse improves the efficiency of acquiring transient events in real time, lowers the technical barriers for simultaneous observations, and provides robust technical support for multi-wavelength, multi-messenger time-domain astronomy and astrophysics studies.","['Jian-Hua Fang', 'Di Li', 'Pei Wang', 'Hua-Xi Chen', 'Han Wang', 'Deng-Ke Zhou', 'Qin-Ping Bao', 'Hai-Yan Li', 'Jing-Jing Hu', 'Jin-Tao Xie', 'Xiao-Dong Ge', 'Yi Feng', 'Dong-Hui Quan', 'Zhi-Xuan Kang', 'Xue-Rong Guo', 'Chen-Wu Jin', 'Zhi-Lin Wang', 'Jia-Ying Xu', 'Chen-Chen Miao', 'Ru-Shuang Zhao', 'Chen-Hui Niu']",8.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04247,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,"['summarizing the key metadata of astronomical events', 'Dec', 'Transient sources', 'and Source Type are extracted from the textual messages using LLMs', 'These criteria allow astronomers to filter mes- sages and locate relevant transient source alerts', 'extracted from the alert reports', 'Source Name', 'such as RA', 'Dechms', 'The results are then sorted by relevance and citation count', 'Report Subjects', 'The bottom section displays recent alerts and a skymap showing the spatial distribution of transient sources', 'RAhms', 'Locerr', 'Tele- scope', 'showing only the top 20 papers']",2025-01-09
Constrain the GRB jet opening angle based on the very steep decay phase,"Thanks to the rapid follow-up observations by \textit{Swift}/XRT, a good part of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) high latitude emission have been observed in X-ray band. Some of them even show a dropdown decay after this period, which strongly indicates the edge of the jet is corresponding to the breaking time. This study constrains the jet opening angles of GRBs by analyzing the very steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Using data from \textit{Swift}/XRT, we identified GRBs with significant breaks in their light curves and applied a broken power-law model to describe the decay phases. Assuming a spherical and isotropic emitting surface, we set constraints on the radiation radius ($R_{\gamma}$) to estimate jet opening angles ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) from the breaking time. Our results indicate that jet opening angles can be constrained, although they are sensitive to the assumed radiation radius. This approach provides yet another method for estimating GRB jet opening angles.","['Qian Xu', 'Dong-Jie Liu', 'Yuan-Chuan Zou']",1.0,7.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04252,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma-ray burst: general – stars: jets – relativistic processes 1'],2025-01-09
Research on the Interstellar Medium and Star Formation in the Galaxy: An Indian Perspective,"Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved.

LAMOST Reveals Long-lived Protoplanetary Disks,"While both observations and theories demonstrate that protoplanetary disks are not expected to live much longer than $\sim$10 Myr, several examples of prolonged disks have been observed in the past. In this work, we perform a systematic search for aged YSOs still surrounded by protoplanetary disks in the M star catalog from the LAMOST archive. We identify 14 sources older than 10 Myr, still surrounded by protoplanetary disks and with ongoing accretion activities, significantly improving the census of the category known as the Peter Pan disks. The stellar parameters, variability and accretion properties of these objects, as well as their spatial distribution, are investigated. Nearly all of these objects are distributed far away from nearby associations and star forming regions, but show evidence of being members of open clusters. Investigating the correlation between mass accretion rates and stellar masses, we find these long-lived disks accrete at systematically lower levels, compared to their younger counterparts with similar stellar masses. Studying the evolution of mass accretion rates with stellar ages, we find these aged disks follow similar trend as young ones.","['Xiao-Long Wang', 'Min Fang', 'Yao Liu', 'Miao-Miao Zhang', 'Wen-Yuan Cui']",12.0,24.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04295,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,AJ,,['Young Stellar Objects — Accretion and accretion disks — Protoplanetary disks — LAMOST — Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams Corresponding author: Min Fang xlwang@hebtu'],2025-01-09

Influence of Planetary Rotation on Supersonic Flow of Lava Planets: A Two-Dimensional Horizontal Model Analysis,"The study of lava planets has attracted significant attention recently because of their close proximity to their host stars, which enhances their detectability for atmospheric characterization. Previous studies showed that the atmospheric flow becomes supersonic if the atmosphere was dominated by rocky vapor evaporated from the magma ocean around the substellar point of small lava planets. These studies often assumed an axisymmetric flow about the axis from the substellar point to the antistellar point but ignored the effect of planetary rotation on the climate. The spin rate of lava planets can be rather fast due to their close-in orbits, which can break the aforementioned symmetry and induce the asymmetric flow component. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional framework to explore the influence of planetary rotation on the atmospheric dynamics of these lava planets for the first time, and assess the sensitivity and range of application of our model. Starting from the established one-dimensional axisymmetric atmospheric solution, we obtain the governing equation for the asymmetric flow by expanding with respect to 1/Ro (Ro denotes Rossby number and exceeds unity for typical lava planets). The asymmetric component of supersonic flow is pivotal for future research on the observation of these atmospheres, flow patterns of the magma ocean currents driven by atmospheric winds, and deformation of the planetary shape over long timescales.","['Zhuo-Yang Song', 'Feng Ding', 'Wanying Kang']",9.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04350,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-09
Confirmation of four hot Jupiters detected by TESS using follow-up spectroscopy from MaHPS at Wendelstein together with NEID and TRES,"We report the confirmation and characterization of four hot Jupiter-type exoplanets initially detected by TESS: TOI-1295 b, TOI-2580 b, TOI-6016 b, and TOI-6130 b. Using observations with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph MaHPS on the 2.1m telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, together with NEID at Kitt Peak National Observatory and TRES at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, we confirmed the planetary nature of these four planet candidates. We also performed precise mass measurements. All four planets are found to be hot Jupiters with orbital periods between 2.4 and 4.0 days. The sizes of these planets range from 1.29 to 1.64 Jupiter radii, while their masses range from 0.6 to 1.5 Jupiter masses. Additionally, we investigated whether there are signs of other planets in the systems but have found none. Lastly, we compared the radii of our four objects to the results of an empirical study of radius inflation and see that all four demonstrate a good fit with the current models. These four planets belong to the first array of planets confirmed with MaHPS data, supporting the ability of the spectrograph to detect planets around fainter stars as faint as V=12.","['Juliana Ehrhardt', 'Luis Thomas', 'Hanna Kellermann', 'Christine Freitag', 'Frank Grupp', 'Samuel W.

The evolution of the flux-size relationship in protoplanetary discs by viscous evolution and radial pebble drift,"In this paper we study the evolution of radiative fluxes, flux radii and observable dust masses in protoplanetary discs, in order to understand how these depend on the angular momentum budget and on the assumed heat sources. We use a model that includes the formation and viscous evolution of protoplanetary gas discs, together with the growth and radial drift of the dust component. We find that we are best able to match the observed fluxes and radii of class 0/I discs when we assume (i) an initial total angular momentum budget corresponding to a centrifugal radius of 40 au around solar-like stars, and (ii) inefficient viscous heating. Fluxes and radii of class II discs appear consistent with disc models with angular momentum budgets equivalent to centrifugal radii of both 40 au or 10 au for solar like stars, and with models where viscous heating occurs at either full efficiency or at reduced efficiency. During the first 0.5 Myr of their evolution discs are generally optically thick at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. However, after this discs are optically thin at mm-wavelengths, supporting standard means of dust mass estimates. Using a disc population synthesis model, we then show that the evolution of the cumulative evolution of the observable dust masses agrees well with that observed in young star forming clusters of different ages.","['Johan Appelgren', 'Anders Johansen', 'Michiel Lambrechts', 'Jes Jørgensen', 'Nienke van der Marel', 'Nagayoshi Ohashi', 'John Tobin']",12.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04411,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Protoplanetary disks – Planets and satellites: formation – Methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-09
JWST photometry and astrometry of 47 Tucanae. Discontinuity in the stellar sequence at the star/brown dwarf transition,"Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 27$. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around $\sim$ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 24$ and $m_{\rm F150W2} \sim 25$. This feature, dubbed ""kink"", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH$_4$ absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.","['M. Scalco', 'R. Gerasimov', 'L. R. Bedin', 'E. Vesperini', 'M. Correnti', 'D. Nardiello', 'A.

Rapid Automated Mapping of Clouds on Titan With Instance Segmentation,"Despite widespread adoption of deep learning models to address a variety of computer vision tasks, planetary science has yet to see extensive utilization of such tools to address its unique problems. On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.","['Zachary Yahn', 'Douglas M Trent', 'Ethan Duncan', 'Benoît Seignovert', 'John Santerre', 'Conor Nixon']",0.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04459,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Image and Video Processing']",,JGR Machine Learning and Computation (2025),[],2025-01-09
ALMA observations of CO isotopologues towards six obscured post-AGB stars,"Low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when an efficient mass-loss process removes a significant fraction of their initial mass. A substantial increase in the mass-loss rate at the end of the AGB is observed for at least some stars for unknown reasons. This creates post-AGB objects that are completely enshrouded in thick dusty envelopes and might be associated with binary interactions. We observed the $J=2-1$ line of $^{13}$CO, C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards six obscured post-AGB stars (four C-rich and two O-rich sources) to constrain the properties of their circumstellar envelopes, recent mass-loss histories, and initial mass of the central stars. Based on the inferred $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O isotopic ratios, we find all stars to have relatively low initial masses ($< 2~M_\odot$) contrary to suggestions in the literature of higher masses for some sources. We infer a mass for HD~187885 $\sim 1.15~M_\odot$, which is relatively low for a carbon star. For all but one source (GLMP~950), we observe kinematic components with velocities $\gtrsim 30$~km~s$^{-1}$, which are faster than typical AGB wind expansion velocities. For most sources, these higher-velocity outflows display point-symmetric morphologies. The case of Hen~3-1475 is particularly spectacular, with the high-velocity molecular outflow interleaved with the high-velocity outflow of ionised gas observed at optical wavelengths. Based on the size of the emission regions of the slow components of the outflows, we derive typical kinematic ages associated with the C$^{18}$O~$J=2-1$ emission $\lesssim 1500$~years and obtain relatively high associated mass-loss rates ($\gtrsim10^{-4}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The sources with known spectral types are found to have evolved faster than expected based on stellar evolutionary models.","['T. Khouri', 'D. Tafoya', 'W. H. T. Vlemmings', 'H. Olofsson', 'C.

Searching the non-accreting white dwarf population in eROSITA data,"eROSITA is the soft X-ray instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite that is most sensitive in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.3 keV. Between December 2019 and December 2021, eROSITA completed four all-sky surveys producing all-sky X-ray source lists and sky maps of unprecedented depth. In the energy range between 0.2 keV and 1 keV, we detected about 38,000 sources with a hardness ratio below -0.94, covering a small sample of known white dwarfs found with eROSITA in the dataset to which the German eROSITA consortium has rights (half sky). 264 of these soft sources have a probability of more than 90 % to be a white dwarf. This is more than the 175 white dwarfs ROSAT found in the whole sky. Here we present the results of a pilot study to increase the sensitivity of eROSITA for soft sources by extending the detection threshold down to 0.1 keV. First tests with dedicated sky regions are promising.","['S. Friedrich', 'C. Maitra', 'K. Dennerl', 'A. Schwope', 'K. Werner', 'B.

The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE. IV. Unveiling the hidden structures in DR18,"The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.","['W.-J.

"NGTS-EB, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary","Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.","['Toby Rodel', 'Christopher.

Spectral Study of Aql~X-1 during \textit{Pulse-on} and \textit{Pulse-off} Stages,"We present a detailed spectral study of an intermittent-AMXP Aql X-1 during the \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages by using the archival RXTE data. We first perform temporal analysis by using Z$_n^2$ technique in three different energy bands, 3.0 -- 13.0~keV, 13.0 -- 23.0~keV and 23.0 -- 33.0~keV, for the last 128~s time segment of the RXTE data including \textit{pulse-on} region. We show that the pulse is the most significant in the softest band. We, then, show that the spectrum is represented the best via combination of absorbed blackbody, disk blackbody and a gaussian line. We modeled the last four segments of the data 30188-03-05-00 to better compare \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages. We found a vague residual in the spectral fit of the \textit{pulse-on} segment between $\sim$3.0 -- 13.0~keV which agrees with the result of temporal analysis. We show that the residual may be represented with an extra blackbody component with the temperature of 1.75~keV and the radius of 0.75$\pm$0.49 km. For deeper analysis, we performed phase-resolved spectroscopy to the last 128~s, \textit{pulse-on}, segment. We obtain two separate spectra for the spin phase range of 0.75 -- 0.25, \textit{pulse-high} and 0.25 -- 0.75, \textit{pulse-low} and followed the same procedure. We display that the residual becomes more clear for \textit{pulse-high} compared to the \textit{pulse-low}. We report that the additional blackbody component, which models the residual, indicates a hotspot from the surface of the neutron star with the radius of 1.65$\pm$0.74 km whose temperature is 1.65 keV.","['T.

The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae,"We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to <60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20<delta<60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.","['Ido Avitan', 'Noam Soker']",6.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04549,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['outflows – planetary nebulae: general 1', 'stars: jets – stars: AGB and post-AGB – binaries: close – stars: winds']",2025-01-09
Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs,"The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.","['Pantelis Pnigouras', 'Samuel K.

MINDS. The influence of outer dust disc structure on the volatile delivery to the inner disc,"ALMA has revealed that the millimetre dust structures of protoplanetary discs are extremely diverse. It has been proposed that the strength of H$_2$O emission in the inner disc particularly depends on the influx of icy pebbles from the outer disc, a process that would correlate with the outer dust disc radius, and that could be prevented by pressure bumps. This work aims to assess the influence of pressure bumps on the inner disc's molecular reservoirs. Using JWST's MIRI/MRS, we compared the observational emission properties of H$_2$O, HCN, C$_2$H$_2$, and CO$_2$ with the outer dust disc structure from ALMA observations, in eight discs with confirmed gaps in ALMA observations, and two discs with gaps of tens of astronomical units in width, around stars with $M_\star \geq 0.45M_{\odot}$. We used new visibility plane fits of the ALMA data to determine the outer dust disc radius and identify substructures in the discs. We find that the presence of a dust gap does not necessarily result in weak H$_2$O emission. Furthermore, the relative lack of colder H$_2$O-emission seems to go hand in hand with elevated emission from carbon-bearing species. The discs with cavities and extremely wide gaps appear to behave as a somewhat separate group, with stronger cold H$_2$O emission and weak warm H$_2$O emission. We conclude that fully blocking radial dust drift from the outer disc seems difficult to achieve. However, there does seem to be a dichotomy between discs that show a strong cold H$_2$O excess and ones that show strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$. Better constraints on the influence of the outer dust disc structure and inner disc composition require more information on substructure formation timescales and disc ages, along with the importance of trapping of volatiles like CO and CO$_2$ into more strongly bound ices like H$_2$O and chemical transformation of CO into less volatile species.","['Danny Gasman', 'Milou Temmink', 'Ewine F. van Dishoeck', 'Nicolas T.

Vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc from SDSS/Gaia,"[Abbreviated] Context: Studies of the LMC's internal kinematics have provided a detailed view of its structure, largely by the exquisite proper motion data supplied by Gaia. However, LoS velocities are only available for a small subset of Gaia data, limiting studies of the kinematics perpendicular to the LMC disc plane. Aims: We synergise new SDSS-IV/V LoS velocity measurements with Gaia data, increasing the 5D phase-space sample by almost a factor of three. We interpret and model the vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc. Methods: Split our sample into different stellar types. Then examine maps of vertical velocity moments perpendicular to the LMC disc. We interpret our results within three possible scenarios: 1) time-variability in the orientation of the disc symmetry axis; 2) use of an incorrect LMC disc plane orientation; or 3) the presence of warps or twists in the LMC disc. We also present a new method to construct a continuous 3D representation of the disc from spatially-resolved measurements of its viewing angles. Results: Using young stellar populations, we identify a region in the LMC arm with highly negative v_z'; this overlaps spatially with the supershell LMC 4. Our results indicate that: 1) the LMC viewing angles may vary with time, but this cannot explain most of the structure in v_z' maps; 2) when re-deriving the LMC disc plane by minimising the RMS vertical velocity v_z' across the disc, the inclination and line-of-nodes position angle are i ~ 24 degr and \Omega ~ 327 degr, respectively; 3) we obtain different inclinations for the inner and outer disc regions, and a quadrupolar variation with azimuth in outer the disc. We provide 3D models of the LMC disc shape. Conclusions: The combination of SDSS-IV/V and Gaia data reveal that the LMC disc is not a flat plane in equilibrium, but that the central bar region is tilted relative to a warped outer disc.","['Ó.

Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations,"We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the ""hit-and-stick"" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $< 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.","['Chuchu Xiang', 'Nina Merkert', 'Lorin S.

Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law,"Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.","['Ruben Lier', 'Akash Jain', 'Jay Armas', 'Oliver Porth']",2.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04638,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-09
Effort: a fast and differentiable emulator for the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe,"We present the official release of the EFfective Field theORy surrogaTe (Effort), a novel and efficient emulator designed for the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). This tool combines state-of-the-art numerical methods and clever preprocessing strategies to achieve exceptional computational performance without sacrificing accuracy. To validate the emulator reliability, we compare Bayesian posteriors sampled using Effort via Hamiltonian MonteCarlo methods to the ones sampled using the widely-used pybird code, via the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. On a large-volume set of simulations, and on the BOSS dataset, the comparison confirms excellent agreement, with deviations compatible with MonteCarlo noise.

Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies,"Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.","['Aman Gupta', 'Pooja Bhattacharjee', 'Pratik Majumdar']",6.0,25.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04663,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,"['light-long-lived mediator', 'gamma-ray analysis', 'Sommerfeld enhancementarXiv:2501', 'indirect detection', 'Dark matter', 'dwarf spheroidal galaxy']",2025-01-09
Cosmological Perturbations from a New Approach to Inflation,"In a previous paper we proposed a new approach to the beginning of inflation -- a lingering universe. The universe begins in a lingering state with a nearly vanishing Hubble parameter. This calls into question the absolute age of the universe, as the Hubble time can be nearly infinite. It also provides promise for addressing the initial singularity of inflation and issues with quantum field theory in de Sitter space-time. Such models arise in classical cosmologies with non-vanishing spatial curvature (inspired by PLANCK 2018 data), and independently by models that arise in string cosmology. In this paper, we consider the importance of cosmological perturbations for the stability of the lingering phase and how this influences cosmological observations. Our goal is to establish observables in this new paradigm for the origin of inflation which is in contrast to eternal inflation and cyclic cosmologies. We also address questions of stability and the transition to inflation.","['Brandon Melcher', 'Arnab Pradhan', 'Scott Watson']",13.0,32.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04669,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-09
A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters,"Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q>0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q<0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.","['R. Gratton', 'M. Bonavita', 'D. Mesa', 'S.

The Forward Physics Facility at the HL-LHC and its Synergies with Astroparticle Physics,"High-energy collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a vast flux of particles along the beam collision axis, a region not accessible by current LHC experiments. The study of multi-particle production in the far-forward region is especially important for astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays create extensive air showers (EAS) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions in the non-perturbative QCD regime. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is crucial for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for searches of astrophysical neutrinos, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC, hosting various far-forward experiments designed to detect particles outside the current LHC acceptance. We will outline the current plans for the FPF and highlight its synergies with astroparticle physics. Specifically, we will discuss how FPF measurements will enhance the modeling of high-energy interactions in the atmosphere, helping to reduce the associated uncertainties in multi-messenger astrophysics.",['Dennis Soldin'],6.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04714,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-10

From proto-neutron star dynamo to low-field magnetars,"Low-field magnetars have dipolar magnetic fields that are 10-100 times weaker than the threshold, $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G, used to define classical magnetars, yet they produce similar X-ray bursts and outbursts. Using the first direct numerical simulations of magneto-thermal evolution starting from a dynamo-generated magnetic field, we show that the low-field magnetars can be produced as a result of a Tayler--Spruit dynamo inside the proto-neutron star. We find that these simulations naturally explain key characteristics of low-field magnetars: (1) weak ($\lesssim 10^{13}$ G) dipolar magnetic fields, (2) strong small-scale fields, and (3) magnetically induced crustal failures producing X-ray bursts. These findings suggest two distinct formation channels for classical and low-field magnetars, potentially linked to different dynamo mechanisms.","['Andrei Igoshev', 'Paul Barrère', 'Raphaël Raynaud', 'Jérome Guilet', 'Toby Wood', 'Rainer Hollerbach']",11.0,25.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04768,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,a journal,,"['neutron stars', 'X-ray Magnetars play a special role in modern high-energy astrophysics', 'dynamo', 'magnetars']",2025-01-10
Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory,"We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.","['Anton Chudaykin', 'Mikhail M.

Deep Photometric Observations of Ultra-Faint Milky Way Satellites Centaurus I and Eridanus IV,"We present deep Magellan$+$Megacam imaging of Centaurus I (Cen I) and Eridanus IV (Eri IV), two recently discovered Milky Way ultra-faint satellites. Our data reach $\sim2-3$ magnitudes deeper than the discovery data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey. We use these data to constrain their distances, structural properties (e.g., half-light radii, ellipticity, and position angle), and luminosities. We investigate whether these systems show signs of tidal disturbance, and identify new potential member stars using Gaia EDR3. Our deep color-magnitude diagrams show that Cen I and Eri IV are consistent with an old ($\tau\sim 13.0$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\text{[Fe/H]}\le-2.2$) stellar population. We find Cen I to have a half-light radius of $r_{h}=2.60\pm0.30'$ ($90.6\pm11$ pc), an ellipticity of $\epsilon=0.36\pm0.05$, a distance of $D=119.8\pm4.1$ kpc ($m-M=20.39\pm0.08$ mag), and an absolute magnitude of $M_{V}=-5.39\pm0.19$. Similarly, Eri IV has $r_{h}=3.24\pm0.48'$ ($65.9\pm10$ pc), $\epsilon=0.26\pm0.09$, $D=69.9\pm3.6$ kpc ($m-M=19.22\pm0.11$ mag), and $M_{V}=-3.55\pm0.24$. These systems occupy a space on the size-luminosity plane consistent with other known Milky Way dwarf galaxies which supports the findings from our previous spectroscopic follow-up. Cen I has a well-defined morphology which lacks any clear evidence of tidal disruption, whereas Eri IV hosts a significant extended feature with multiple possible interpretations.","['Quinn O.

Constraining $\gamma$-ray dissipation site in gravitationally lensed quasar -- PKS 1830$-$211,"Variable $\gamma$-ray flares upto minute timescales reflect extreme particle acceleration sites. However, for high-redshift blazars, the detection of such rapid variations remains limited by current telescope sensitivities. Gravitationally lensed blazars serve as powerful tools to probe $\gamma$-ray production zones in distant sources, with time delays between lensed signals providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of emission regions relative to the lens's mass-weighted center. We have utilized 15 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data from direction of PKS 1830$-$211 to understand the origin of flaring high-energy production zone at varying flux states. To efficiently estimate the (lensed) time delay, we used a machine learning-based tool - the Gaussian Process regression algorithm, in addition to - Autocorrelation function and Double power spectrum. We found a consistent time delay across all flaring activity states, indicating a similar location for the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, possibly within the radio core. The estimated time delay of approximately 20 days for the five flaring epochs was significantly shorter than previously estimated radio delays. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is closer to the central engine, in contrast to the radio emission zone, which is expected to be much farther away. A linear relationship between lag and magnification has been observed in the identified source and echo flares. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone originates from similar regions away from the site of radio dissipation.","['Sushmita Agarwa', 'Amit Shukla', 'Pranjali Sharma']",10.0,11.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04775,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,MNRAS,,['gravitational lensing: strong - methods: statistical - galaxies: active - galaxies: high-redshift - galaxies: jets - gamma-rays: galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION TheaccretionofmatterontosupermassiveblackholespowersActive GalacticNuclei(AGN)'],2025-01-10
Impact of accretion-induced chemically homogeneous evolution on stellar and compact binary populations,"In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.","[""Marco Dall'Amico"", 'Michela Mapelli', 'Giuliano Iorio', 'Guglielmo Costa', 'Stéphane Charlot', 'Erika Korb', 'Cecilia Sgalletta', 'Marie Lecroq']",12.0,28.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04778,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",,,['Methods: numerical - Stars: Wolf-Rayet - Stars: black holes - Binaries: general - Gravitational waves 1'],2025-01-10

The Evolution of Half-Mass Radii and Color Gradients for Young and Old Quiescent Galaxies at $0.5 < z < 3$ with JWST/PRIMER,"We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between $0.5<z<3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$>10$, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-$M_*$/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio $r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7$\mu$m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, $10<$log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$<11$, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5<z<3$.

We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.","['Tobias Röspel', 'Adrian Schlosser', 'Björn Malte Schäfer']",7.0,9.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04791,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,"['information entropy', 'Bayesian evidence', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo', 'normalising flows', 'supernova cosmology 1', 'inference in cosmology']",2025-01-10
Effective resistivity in relativistic reconnection: a prescription based on fully kinetic simulations,"A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the release -- via magnetic reconnection -- of the energy stored in oppositely directed fields. Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with uniform resistivity yield dissipation rates that are much lower (by nearly one order of magnitude) than equivalent kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven phenomena could be accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a non-uniform, ``effective'' resistivity informed by kinetic calculations. In this work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection -- where the magnetic energy is greater than the rest mass energy -- for different strengths of the guide field orthogonal to the alternating component. We extract an empirical prescription for the effective resistivity, $\eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \alpha B_0 \mathbf{|J|}^p / \left(|\mathbf{J}|^{p+1}+\left(e n_t c\right)^{p+1}\right)$, where $B_0$ is the reconnecting magnetic field strength, $\bf J$ is the current density, $n_t$ the lab-frame total number density, $e$ the elementary charge, and $c$ the speed of light. The guide field dependence is encoded in $\alpha$ and $p$, which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity formulation -- which relies only on single-fluid MHD quantities -- successfully reproduces the spatial structure and strength of nonideal electric fields, and thus provides a promising strategy for enhancing the reconnection rate in resistive MHD simulations.","['Abigail Moran', 'Lorenzo Sironi', 'Aviad Levis', 'Bart Ripperda', 'Elias R.

Mind the Gap II: the near-UV fluxes of M dwarfs,"Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf stars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of utilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two distinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the $M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number of stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\sim9.4$, coinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy transportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood stellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the effective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at $\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass, contributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two populations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and young stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with bright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.","['Wei-Chun Jao', 'Allison Youngblood']",10.0,20.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04806,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['M dwarf stars (982) — Main sequence stars(1000) — Stellar chromospheres(230) — Ultra- violet photometry(1740) 1'],2025-01-10

Structures of various types of symmetry in the solar activity cycle,"The solar cycle is a complex phenomenon. To comprehensively understand it, we have to study various tracers. The most important component of this complex is the solar dynamo, which is understood as self-excitation of the solar magnetic field in the form of traveling waves somewhere in the convection zone. Along with the solar dynamo, the formation of the solar cycle involves other processes that are associated with the dynamo but are not its necessary part. We give a review of such phenomena that have not yet been explained in terms of dynamo theory. We consider the manifestations of the solar cycle in harmonics of the solar large-scale surface magnetic field, including zonal, sectorial, and tesseral harmonics; analyze their contribution to magnetic energy; and identify phases of the activity cycle using harmonics of different types of symmetry. The universal magnetic scenario of a solar activity cycle does not depend on its number and height. At the beginning of the cycle on the photosphere, the zonal harmonics account for 37-42% of the total energy (not 100%, as assumed in simplified descriptions). Sectorial harmonics do not disappear at all but account for 5-10% of the total energy. At this stage, the greatest energy (about 40%) is contained in the tesseral harmonics. As the cycle develops, the relative energy of zonal harmonics gradually decreases, reaching a minimum of 15-18% immediately before the onset of the sunspot maximum. The relative energy of sectorial harmonics increases and reaches a maximum (60-65%) somewhat later than the calendar date of the sunspot maximum. A particular feature of the tesseral harmonics is that their relative energy index changes in a much narrower range and never falls below 40% even at the cycle minimum. This is due to active regions and nonglobal magnetic fields. It is possible that tesseral harmonics are formed in shallow subphotospheric layers.","['V.N. Obridko', 'A.S. Shibalova', 'D.D.

"Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code","Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.","['Riley Rosener', 'Michael Zhang', 'Jacob L.

Identifying Flare Locations Through Exoplanet Transit Occultations,"M dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, with long lifespans, a high occurrence rate of rocky planets, and close-in habitable zones. However, high stellar activity in the form of frequent flaring and any associated coronal mass ejections may drive atmospheric escape with the bombardment of radiation and high-energy particles, drastically impacting the habitability of these systems. The stellar latitude where flares and coronal mass ejections occur determines the space weather that exoplanets are subject to, with high-energy particle events associated with equatorial flares producing significant atmospheric erosion. However, the flaring latitudes for M dwarfs remain largely unconstrained. To aid in the effort to locate these flaring regions we explore the applicability of flare occultations using optical photometry to identify the latitudes of flares. As a planet transits in front of an ongoing flare the timing and geometry of the transit can be used to constrain the latitude and longitude of the flare. We predict the probability of detecting an occultation for known transiting planets and eclipsing binaries. From this, we estimate 3-22 detectable occultations exist within the TESS primary mission photometry, with the majority occurring in eclipsing binary observations. To demonstrate this technique, we analyze a candidate flare occultation event for the eclipsing binary CM Draconis.","['Tayt Armitage', 'David V.

Parallactic delay for geodetic VLBI and non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes,"The Gaia optical astrometric mission has measured the precise positions of millions of objects in the sky, including extragalactic sources also observed by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the recent Gaia EDR3 release, an effect of negative parallax with a magnitude of approximately -17 $\mu$as was reported, presumably due to technical reasons related to the relativistic delay model. A recent analysis of a 30-year set of geodetic VLBI data revealed a similar negative parallax with an amplitude of $-15.8 \pm 0.5$ $ \mu$as. Since both astrometric techniques, optical and radio, provide consistent estimates of this negative parallax, it is necessary to investigate the potential origin of this effect. We developed the extended group relativistic delay model to incorporate the additional parallactic effect for radio sources at distances less than 1 Mpc and found that the apparent annual signal might appear due the non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes, which are defined by the positions of the reference radio sources themselves. Unlike the conventional parallactic ellipse, the apparent annual effect in this case appears as a circular motion for all objects independently of their ecliptic latitude. The measured amplitude of this circular effect is within a range of 10-15 $\mu$as that is consistent with the ICRF3 stability of the fundamental axis. This annual circular effect could also arise if a Gödel-type cosmological metric were applied, suggesting that, in the future, this phenomenon could be used to indicate global cosmic rotation.","['Oleg Titov', 'Angelina Osetrova']",3.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04872,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Volume 41, 2024, e111",[],2025-01-10
GRB 241030A: a prompt thermal X-ray emission component and diverse origin of the very early UVOT WHITE and U band emission,"We present a detailed analysis of the long-duration GRB 241030A detected by {\it Swift}. Thanks to the rapid response of XRT and UVOT, the strongest part of the prompt emission of GRB 241030A has been well measured simultaneously from optical to hard X-ray band. The time-resolved WHITE band emission shows strong variability, largely tracing the activity of the prompt gamma-ray emission, may be produced by internal shocks too. The joint analysis of the XRT and BAT data reveals the presence of a thermal component with a temperature of a few keV, which can be interpreted as the photosphere radiation, and the upper limit of the Lorentz factor of this region is found to range between approximately 20 and 80. The time-resolved analysis of the initial U-band exposure data yields a very rapid rise ($ \sim t^{5.3}$) with a bright peak reaching 13.6 AB magnitude around 410 seconds, which is most likely attributed to the onset of the external shock emission. The richness and fineness of early observational data have made this burst a unique sample for studying the various radiation mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts.","['Qiu-Li Wang', 'Hao Zhou', 'Yun Wang', 'Jia Ren', 'Samaporn Tinyanont', 'Dong Xu', 'Ning-Chen Sun', 'Johan P.U.

Another piece to the puzzle: radio detection of a JWST discovered AGN candidate,"Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots"" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} < 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.","['Anniek J.

Peculiar radio-bright behaviour of the Galactic black hole transient 4U 1543-47 in the 2021-2023 outburst,"Correlated behaviours between the radio emission and the X-ray emission in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) in the X-ray hard state are crucial to the understanding of disc-jet coupling of accreting black holes. The BH transient 4U 1543-47 went into outburst in 2021 following ~19 years of quiescence. We followed it up with ~weekly cadence with MeerKAT for about one year and a half until it faded into quiescence. Multi-epoch quasi-simultaneous MeerKAT and X-ray observations allowed us to trace the compact jet emission and its X-ray emission. In its hard spectral state across three orders of magnitude of X-ray luminosities above ~10$^{34}$ ergs/s, we found the correlation between radio and X-ray emission had a power-law index of 0.82$\pm$0.09, steeper than the canonical value of ~0.6 for BH XRBs. In addition, the radio vs. X-ray correlation shows a large range of the power-law normalization, with the maximum significantly larger than that obtained for most BH XRBs, indicating it can be particularly radio-bright and variable in the X-ray binary sample. The radio emission is unlikely diluted by discrete jet components. The observed peculiar radio-bright and variable behaviours provide the evidence for the relativistic effects of a variable Lorentz factor in the range between 1 and ~2 of the compact jet.","['X.

To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.","['C.S.

The Catalogue of Virtual Early-Type Galaxies from IllustrisTNG: Validation and Real Observation Consistency,"Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are reference systems to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes. The physics of their collapse and internal dynamics are codified in well-known scaling relations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations play an important role, providing insights into the 3D distribution of matter and galaxy formation mechanisms, as well as validating methods to infer the properties of real objects. In this work, we present the closest-to-reality sample of ETGs from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation, dubbed ""virtual-ETGs,"" based on an observational-like algorithm that combines standard projected and three-dimensional galaxy structural parameters. We extract 2D photometric information by projecting the galaxies' light into three planes and modeling them via Sérsic profiles. Aperture velocity dispersions, corrected for softened central dynamics, are calculated along the line-of-sight orthogonal to the photometric projection plane. Central mass density profiles assume a power-law model, while 3D masses remain unmodified from the IllustrisTNG catalogue. The final catalogue includes $10121$ galaxies at redshifts $z \leq 0.1$. By comparing the virtual properties with observations, we find that the virtual-ETG scaling relations (e.g., size-mass, size-central surface brightness, and Faber-Jackson), central density slopes, and scaling relations among total density slopes and galaxy structural parameters are generally consistent with observations. We make the virtual-ETG publicly available for galaxy formation studies and plan to use this sample as a training set for machine learning tools to infer galaxy properties in future imaging and spectroscopic surveys.","['Pedro de Araujo Ferreira', 'Nicola R.

Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS): survey overview and the result of global mass-metallicity relation,"Low-mass galaxies are the building blocks of massive galaxies in the framework of hierarchical structure formation. To enable detailed studies of galactic ecosystems in dwarf galaxies by spatially resolving different galactic components, we have carried out the Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS). This survey aims to acquire observations with spatial resolutions as high as 10 to 100 pc while maintaining reasonably high signal-to-noise ratios with VLT/MUSE and ANU-2.3m/WiFeS. The whole sample will be composed of 65 dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm \ast}$ $<$ 10$^{9}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, selected from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Survey. The overall scientific goals include studying baryonic cycles in dwarf galaxies, searching for off-nuclear (intermediate)-massive black holes, and quantifying the inner density profiles of dark matter. In this work, we describe the sample selection, data reduction, and high-level data products. By integrating the spectra over the field of view for each galaxy, we obtained the integrated gas-phase metallicity and discussed its dependence on stellar mass and SFR. We find that the overall relation between metallicity and stellar mass of our DGIS nearly follows the extrapolation from the higher mass end. Its dispersion does not decrease by invoking the dependence on SFR.","['Xin Li', 'Yong Shi', 'Fuyan Bian', 'Xiaoling Yu', 'Zhiyuan Zheng', 'Songlin Li', 'Yanmei Chen', 'Qiusheng Gu', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Shude Mao', 'Xiangdong Li', 'Hongxin Zhang', 'Kai Zhu', 'Zhiyu Zhang']",24.0,40.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04943,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['surveys — galaxies: dwarf(65) — galaxies: fundamental parameters — methods: data analysis — ISM: abundances 1'],2025-01-10
Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation,"Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to use the realistic galaxies' Probability Distribution Function (PDF) that describes each galaxy redshift to select samples and include in the fitting model as the input for the redshift uncertainty. We used four different photo-z estimators \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \texttt{Pz Cats}. Furthermore, for each algorithm, we selected two different samples according to the PDFs shape, one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and the other that chooses the least noisy PDFs in which the PDFs have one pronounced peak. We computed the correlation function $\xi_\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{eff}$, We concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \texttt{ANNz2} is the best photo-z estimator for BAO analysis considering the realistic full probability distribution function of each galaxy.","['Paula S.

Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars,"$r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.","['Wenhao Dong', 'Andrew Melatos']",1.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04968,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",MNRAS,,"['whoserestoring force is the Coriolis force', 'accretion discs – asteroseismology – gravitational waves – stars: neutron – stars: oscillations – stars: rotation 1 INTRODUCTION 𝑟-modesareinertialmodesinrotatingneutronstars', 'accretion']",2025-01-10
The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) VI: The RACS-high 1655.5 MHz images and catalogue,"We have conducted a widefield, wideband, snapshot survey using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) referred to as the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). RACS covers $\approx$ 90% of the sky, with multiple observing epochs in three frequency bands sampling the ASKAP frequency range of 700 to 1800 MHz.

Multiple Populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2257: No Major Environmental Effect on the Formation of Multiple Populations of the Old Globular Clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud,"How the environment of the host galaxy affects the formation of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the outstanding questions in the near-field cosmology. To understand the true nature of the old GC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry of the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated populational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\pm$4), where the FG and SG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar cumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is dynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\pm$0.00 dex($\sigma$=0.05 dex) and our metallicity is $\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution spectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\sim$ $-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than the SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to Galactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic of GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium enhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit that the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with the GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass. We show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in the $\Delta$W$_{\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\rm FG}/N_{\rm tot}$, and $\log M/M_{\rm \odot}$ domains.

Anisotropic diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,"The origin of cosmic rays (CRs) and how they propagate remain unclear. Studying the propagation of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can help to comprehend many open issues related to CR origin and the role of turbulent magnetic fields. To comprehend the phenomenon of slow diffusion in the near-source region, we study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field to reveal their universal laws. We numerically study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field, considering pulsar wind nebula as a general research case. Taking the magnetization parameter and turbulence spectral index as free parameters, together with radiative losses, we perform three group simulations to analyze the CR spectral, spatial distributions, and possible CR diffusion types. Our studies demonstrate that (1) CR energy density decays with both its effective radius and kinetic energy in the form of power-law distributions; (2) the morphology of the CR spatial distribution strongly depends on the properties of magnetic turbulence and the viewing angle; (3) CRs suffer a slow diffusion near the source and a fast/normal diffusion away from the source; (4) the existence of a power-law relationship between the averaged CR energy density and the magnetization parameter is independent of both CR energy and radiative losses; (5) radiative losses can suppress CR anisotropic diffusion and soften the power-law distribution of CR energy density. The distribution law established between turbulent magnetic fields and CRs presents an intrinsic property, providing a convenient way to understand complex astrophysical processes related to turbulence cascades.","['Na-Na Gao', 'Jian-Fu Zhang']",8.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04986,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,A&A,,['galaxies: ISM – galaxies: magnetic fields – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – ISM: cosmic rays – ISM: di ffusion 1'],2025-01-10
ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects,"We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.","['Takashi Shimonishi', 'Takashi Onaka', 'Itsuki Sakon']",5.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05008,Astrophysics of Galaxies,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",ApJ,,['astrochemistry — ISM: molecules — radio lines: ISM 1'],2025-01-10
Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud II: the connection with the progenitors' properties,"The study of planetary nebulae (PNe) offers the opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of the dust production mechanism during the very late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. We study the relationship between the properties of PNe, particularly the gas and dust content, with the mass and metallicity of the progenitor stars, to understand how dust production works in the late AGB phases, and to shed new light on the physical processes occurring to the stars and the material in their surroundings since the departure from the AGB until the PN phase. We consider a sample of 9 PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 7 out of which characterized by the presence of carbonaceous dust, the remaining 2 with silicates. For these stars the masses and the metallicity of the progenitor stars were estimated. We combine results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling with those coming from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution, to find the relation between the dust and gas mass of the PNe considered and the The physical properties of carbon-rich PNe are influenced by the mass of the progenitor star. Specifically, the dust-to-gas ratio in the nebula increases from 5x10^{-4}to 6x10^{-3} as the progenitor star's mass increases from approximately 0.9Msun to 2Msun. This change is partly influenced by the effective temperature of the PNe, and it occurs because higher-mass carbon stars are more efficient at producing dust. Consequently, as the progenitor's mass increases, the gas mass of the PNe decreases, since the larger amounts of dust lead to greater effects from radiation pressure, which pushes the gas outwards. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn by the study of the PNe with silicate-type dust, because the sub-sample is made up of 2 PNe only, one of which is almost dust-free.","['P. Ventura', 'S.

Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations,"We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $>6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.","['Fupeng Zhang', 'Pau Amaro Seoane']",11.0,27.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05016,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Black-hole physics – gravitation – gravitational waves – Galaxy: center – Galaxy: nucleus – relativistic processes – stars: kinematics and dynamics 1'],2025-01-10
Euclid: Detecting Solar System objects in Euclid images and classifying them using Kohonen self-organising maps,"The ESA Euclid mission will survey more than 14,000 deg$^2$ of the sky in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, mapping the extra-galactic sky to constrain our cosmological model of the Universe. Although the survey focusses on regions further than 15 deg from the ecliptic, it should allow for the detection of more than about $10^5$ Solar System objects (SSOs). After simulating the expected signal from SSOs in Euclid images acquired with the visible camera (VIS), we describe an automated pipeline developed to detect moving objects with an apparent velocity in the range of 0.1-10 arcsec/h, typically corresponding to sources in the outer Solar System (from Centaurs to Kuiper-belt objects). In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on Sourcextractor software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating moving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters to improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness of the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural network can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify stars, galaxies, and SSOs. By implementing an early-stopping method in the training scheme, we show that the network can be used in a predictive way, allowing one to assign the probability of each detected object being a member of each considered class.","['A.

Exploring the variation in the dynamic rotation profile of the hotter solar atmosphere using mutliwavelength data,"The global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation at different layers, although crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field, has been a subject to contradictory results throughout the past century. In this study, we thereby unify the results for different parts of the multi-thermal Solar atmosphere by utilizing 13 years of data in 7 wavelength channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) atop the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Using the method of image correlation, we find that the solar atmosphere exhibits a rotational profile that is up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster at the equator and comparatively less differential than that of the photosphere, as derived from Doppler measurements and sunspots, respectively and exhibits variation at different respective heights. Additionally, we find results suggestive of the role played by the rooting of different magnetic field structures on a comparison with helioseismology data.","['Srinjana Routh', 'Bibhuti Kumar Jha', 'Dibya Kirti Mishra', 'Tom Van Doorsselaere', 'Vaibhav Pant', 'Subhamoy Chatterjee', 'Dipankar Banerjee']",2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05026,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['Sun: atmosphere', 'Sun: solar cycle', 'Sun:corona', 'Sun:activity 1', 'Sun: differential rotation']",2025-01-10
Observational Study of the Atmospheric Gravity Waves in the lower Solar Atmosphere,"The solar chromosphere exhibits a variety of waves originating from the photosphere and deeper layers, causing oscillations at different heights with distinct frequencies. This study identifies and analyze Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) and acoustic waves at various height pairs within the solar atmosphere utilising H$\alpha$, Ca II IR and Fe I 6173 A imaging spectroscopic observations from Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. We study and compare oscillations by analyzing power maps generated using velocities obtained from the filtergram difference and bisector methods. Our analysis shows a consistent increase in power with height in the solar chromosphere for both methods. In addition to this, our results show that AGWs are detected within or near magnetic flux concentration regions, where spicules are also predominant, exhibiting significant power in the chromosphere. These regions also feature inclined magnetic fields, which might be contributing to the propagation of these low-frequency AGWs in the chromosphere. Examining average power maps at spicule locations reveals significant power at AGWs frequency across different chromospheric heights. We speculate that these AGWs propagate upward along spicular structures and were not previously detected in the studies employing space-time map due to their limited lifetime. This study provides insights into the complex dynamics of solar chromospheric waves influenced by magnetic field, contributing to our understanding of AGWs and acoustic waves propagation across different layers of the solar atmosphere.","['Ravi Chaurasiya', 'Ankala Raja Bayanna']",14.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05042,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Sun: atmosphere – Sun: chromosphere – Sun: oscillations – Sun: magnetic fields 1 INTRODUCTION ThechromosphereisathinlayerintheSun’satmosphere'],2025-01-10
Fully comprehensive diagnostic of galaxy activity using principal components of visible spectra: implementation on nearby S0s,"We introduce a novel galaxy classification methodology based on the visible spectra of a sample of over 68,000 nearby ($z\leq 0.1$) Sloan Digital Sky Survey lenticular (S0) galaxies. Unlike traditional diagnostic diagrams, which rely on a limited set of emission lines and class dividers to identify ionizing sources, our approach provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing galaxies regardless of their activity level. By projecting galaxies into the 2D latent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their entire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from individual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density estimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in the new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance in our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert, composite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical distribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population, demonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant ionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic reflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our analysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently biased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII] emission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies excluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like characteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms unrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion. A machine-readable catalogue listing BPT-class probabilities for the galaxies analysed is available online at the CDS website.","['J. L. Tous', 'J. M. Solanes', 'J. D.

Time-Variant Vector Field Visualization for Magnetic Fields of Neutron Star Simulations,"We present a novel visualization application designed to explore the time-dependent development of magnetic fields of neutron stars. The strongest magnetic fields in the universe can be found within neutron stars, potentially playing a role in initiating astrophysical jets and facilitating the outflow of neutron-rich matter, ultimately resulting in the production of heavy elements during binary neutron star mergers. Since such effects may be dependent on the strength and configuration of the magnetic field, the formation and parameters of such fields are part of current research in astrophysics. Magnetic fields are investigated using simulations in which various initial configurations are tested. However, the long-term configuration is an open question, and current simulations do not achieve a stable magnetic field. Neutron star simulations produce data quantities in the range of several terabytes, which are both spatially in 3D and temporally resolved. Our tool enables physicists to interactively explore the generated data. We first convert the data in a pre-processing step and then we combine sparse vector field visualization using streamlines with dense vector field visualization using line integral convolution. We provide several methods to interact with the data responsively. This allows the user to intuitively investigate data-specific issues. Furthermore, diverse visualization techniques facilitate individual exploration of the data and enable real-time processing of specific domain tasks, like the investigation of the time-dependent evolution of the magnetic field. In a qualitative study, domain experts tested the tool, and the usability was queried. Experts rated the tool very positively and recommended it for their daily work.","['Simon J.

The impact of the redshift-dependent selection effect of halos on the redshift-space power spectrum,"In a wide-area spectroscopic survey of galaxies, it is nearly impossible to obtain a homogeneous sample of galaxies with respect to galaxy properties such as stellar mass and host halo mass across a range of redshifts. Despite the selection effect, theoretical templates in most analyses assume single tracers when compared with the measured clustering quantities. We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\lesssim 0.3~h{\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples. We also argue that the selection effect is unlikely to cause a significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters using the Fisher matrix method, provided that the redshift-dependent selection effect is modest.","['Kanmi Nose', 'Masahiro Takada', 'Ryo Terasawa']",7.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05086,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-10

The ESO SupJup Survey V: Exploring Atmospheric Variability and Orbit of the Super-Jupiter AB Pictoris b with CRIRES+,"A growing number of directly-imaged companions have been recently characterised, with robust constraints on carbon-to-oxygen ratios and even isotopic ratios. Many companions and isolated targets have also shown spectral variability. In this work we observed the super-Jupiter AB~Pictoris~b across four consecutive nights using VLT/CRIRES+ as part of the ESO SupJup survey, exploring how the constraints on chemical composition and temperature profile change over time using spectral line shape variations between nights. We performed atmospheric retrievals of the high-resolution observations and found broadly consistent results across all four nights, but there were differences for some parameters. We clearly detect H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO in each night, but abundances varied by $\sim2\sigma$, which was correlated to the deep atmosphere temperature profiles. We also found differences in the $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C ratios in each night by up to $\sim3\sigma$, which seemed to be correlated with the cloud deck pressure. Our combined retrieval simultaneously analysing all nights together constrained broadly the average of each night individually, with the C/O$=0.59\pm0.01$, consistent with solar composition, and $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C~$ = 102\pm8$, slightly higher than the ISM and Solar System values. We also find a low projected rotational velocity, suggesting that AB~Pictoris~b is either intrinsically a slow rotator due to its young age or that the spin axis is observed pole-on with a $\sim90^\circ$ misalignment with its orbit inclination. Future observations will be able to further explore the variability and orbit of AB~Pictoris~b as well as for other companions.","['Siddharth Gandhi', 'Sam de Regt', 'Ignas Snellen', 'Paulina Palma-Bifani', 'Idriss Abdoulwahab', 'Gaël Chauvin', 'Darío González Picos', 'Yapeng Zhang', 'Rico Landman', 'Tomas Stolker', 'Aurora Kesseli', 'Willeke Mulder', 'Antoine Chomez', 'Anne-Marie Lagrange', 'Alice Zurlo']",17.0,22.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05114,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: atmospheres – planets and satellites: gaseous planets – planets and satellites: composition – techniques: imaging spectroscopy 1 INTRODUCTION Directly-imaged companions at wide orbital separations rep- resent unique targets to characterise formation at the ex- tremes of orbital separation'],2025-01-10
On the conditioning of the solar corona due to large flaring,"Aims: We aim to better characterize the conditions of the solar corona and especially with respect to the occurrence of confined and eruptive flares. Therefore, we have modeled the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar cycle 24. Methods: Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data around each event, we employ nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to approximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source regions. Superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the time series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities is used to pin down the characteristics of the pre- and post-flare time evolution, as well as to assess flare-related changes. Results: (1) During the 24 hours leading to a major flare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux evolve closely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to confined flares the free energy evolves more similar with respect to the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying field, while it is the opposite prior to eruptive flares. (2) The flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\% of major flares when combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local stability. (3) The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels within $\approx$\,6 to 12~hours after eruptive major M-class flares while the impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. (4) Postflare replenishment times of $\gtrsim$12~hours after eruptive X-class flares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive X-class flares within a few hours.","['Julia K.

Detection of thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS) in TMC-1: sulfur-oxygen differentiation along the hydrogenation sequence,"In recent years the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium has experienced a renewed interest due to the detection of a large variety of molecules containing sulfur. Here we report the first identification in space of a new S-bearing molecule, thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS), which is the sulfur counterpart of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We detected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four most favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column density of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less abundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities of the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules increase their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less abundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be less favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources like TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented them into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of magnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde. Quantum chemical calculations carried out for one of the potential formation pathways, the S + C2H5 reaction, indicate that formation of CH3CHS is only a minor channel in this reaction.","['M.

A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope,"Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.","['Zhuowen Li', 'Xizhen Lu', 'Guoliang Lü', 'Chunhua Zhu', 'Helei Liu', 'Jinlong Yu']",4.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05139,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['stars: black holes-stars:evolution 1'],2025-01-10
High-resolution imaging of the radio source associated with Project Hephaistos Dyson Sphere Candidate G,"We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.","['Tongtian Ren', 'Michael A.

Detection of binary companions below the diffraction limit with lucky imaging,"We provide a technique for resolving intermediate-separation binaries stars with medium-sized telescopes (i.e. diameter less than or equal to 2.5 m) at wavelengths around 825 nm in the super-resolution range (i.e. below the limit defined by the Rayleigh criterion). We combined two well-known algorithms that have been applied to reduce the halo in lucky imaging observations: COvariancE of Lucky Images (COELI) and the Lucky Imaging Speckle Suppression Algorithm (LISSA). We reviewed the fundamentals of both algorithms and describe a new technique called Lucky Imaging Super resolution Technique (LIST), which is optimized for peak highlighting within the first ring of the Airy pattern. To validate the technique, we carried out several observing campaigns of well-known binary stars with FastCam on the 1.52 m TCS and 2.56 m NOT. The projected angular separation between objects was resolved by applying LIST with a result below 0.15"". It can go down to approximately 0.05"", given the limitations of the detector plate scale. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that binary companions with such small angular separations have been detected using only lucky imaging at optical wavelengths. The average accuracy achieved for the angular separation measurement is 16 mas with NOT and is 20 mas with TCS. The average accuracy obtained for the position angle measurement is $9.5^o$ for NOT and $11^o$ for TCS. We also made an attempt to measure the relative brightnesses of the binary components, obtaining results that are compatible with literature measurements. Lucky imaging, in combination with speckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of multiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes. However, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime are less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.","['Miguel A. Cagigas', 'R. Clavero', 'Manuel P.

Impact of photoevaporative winds in chemical models of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks,"Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.","['Luke Keyte', 'Thomas J.

Vertical Kinematics of the Young Galactic Clusters,"The young disc vertical phase is paramount in our understanding of Galaxy evolution. Analysing the vertical kinematics at different galactic regions provides important information about the space-time variations of the Galactic potential. The vertical phase snail-shell structure found after Gaia DR2 release encompasses a wide range of ages. %\citep{2018Natur.561..360A, Antoja23}. However, the structure of the $V_Z\, vs \, Z$ diagram appears linear when the analysis is limited to studying objects younger than 30 Ma. Based on the vertical velocity and height-over-disc maps obtained for a sample of young open clusters, this method also allows the matter density in the Solar neighbourhood to be estimated using a completely different approach than previously found in the literature. We use two different catalogues of star clusters to confirm the previous result and study new age ranges. The linear pattern between $V_Z$ and $Z$ shows different slopes, $\partial V_Z/\partial Z$, for various age groups. The results fit a simple model (harmonic oscillator) of in-plane decoupled vertical dynamics up to a certain age limit, corresponding to $\sim$ 30 Ma. This work also analyses the relationship between the local volumetric density of matter ($\rho_0$) and the disc vertical kinematics for different age ranges, all below 50 Ma. The best estimates of the effective volumetric mass density in the Solar neighbourhood, 0.09-0.15 M$_\odot$ pc${}^{-3}$, agree with those given by other authors, assessing the reliability of the proposed dynamical model.

Periods of outbursts and standstills and parameters variations in two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc,"We present our results on two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc. We apply observational data for the periods that cover the states of outbursts and standstills, which are typical for this type of objects. We report an appearance of periodic oscillations in brightness during the standstill in AT Cnc, with small amplitude variations of 0.03 - 0.04 mag and periodicity of $\approx 20-30$ min. Based on the estimated derredened color index (B - V )0, we calculate the color temperature for both states of the two objects. During the transition from the outbursts to the standstill's state Z Cam varies from bluer to redder, while AT Cnc stays redder in both states. We calculate some of the stars' parameters as: the radii of the primary and secondary components, and the orbital separation for both objects. We construct the profiles of the effective temperature in the discs of the two objects. Comparing the parameters of both systems, we see that Z Cam is definitely the hotter object and we conclude it has a more active accretion disk.","['Daniela Boneva', 'Krasimira Yankova', 'Denislav Rusev']",3.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05214,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,"Astronomy, MDPI, 2024, 3, 208-219",['binary stars'],2025-01-10
Bayesian correction of $H(z)$ cosmic chronometers data with systematic errors,"We show that the 32 $H(z)$ data from cosmic chronometers have overestimated uncertainties and make use of a Bayesian method to correct and reduce it. We then use the corrected data to constrain flat $\Lambda$CDM and O$\Lambda$CDM parameters.

Exploring the non-thermal physics behind the pulsar wind nebula PSR J2030+4415 through radio observations,"PSR J2030+4415 is a gamma-ray pulsar with an X-ray pulsar wind nebula elongated along the north-south direction. The system shows a prominent X-ray filament oriented at an angle of 130° to the nebula axis. To improve our understanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula, we attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study its morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament emission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR J2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with findings at other wavelengths. We obtained radio images at 736 and 1274 MHz that reveal a structure trailing the pulsar, with a morphology overlapping the X-ray nebula. This radio structure is the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula. The derived spectral index along this structure shows spatial variation. There are no hints of the pulsar and the filament at any of the explored radio frequencies, but we obtained restrictive upper limits. A physical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and consistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented. We propose that particle acceleration occurs in the nebula tail due to the presence of a re-collimation shock, and the highest energy particles gradually escape from it through energy-dependent diffusion. We also find a lower limit in the energy of the particles escaping along the X-ray filament of ~GeV.","['J.M. Paredes', 'P. Benaglia', 'V. Bosch-Ramon', 'A.Tej', 'A. Saha', 'J. Martí', 'P.

"Revealing the hidden cosmic feast: A z=4.3 galaxy group hosting two optically dark, efficiently star-forming galaxies","We present the confirmation of a compact galaxy group candidate, CGG-z4, at $z=4.3$ in the COSMOS field. This structure was identified by two spectroscopically confirmed $z=4.3$ $K_s$-dropout galaxies with ALMA $870\rm\, \mu m$ and 3 mm continuum detections, surrounded by an overdensity of NIR-detected galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts of $4.0<z<4.6$. The two ALMA sources, CGG-z4.a and CGG-z4.b, are detected with both CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines. [CI](1-0) is detected on CGG-z4.a, and H$_{2}$O($1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}$) absorption is detected on CGG-z4.b. We model an integrated spectral energy distribution by combining the FIR-to-radio photometry of this group and estimate a total star formation rate of $\rm\sim2000\, M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, making it one of the most star-forming groups known at $z>4$. Their high CO(5-4)/CO(4-3) ratios indicate that the inter-stellar mediums (ISMs) are close to thermalization, suggesting either high gas temperatures, densities, and/or pressure, while the low [CI](1-0)/CO(4-3) line ratios indicate high star formation efficiencies. With [CI]-derived gas masses we found the two galaxies have extremely short gas depletion times of $99$ Myr and $<63$ Myr respectively, suggesting the onset of quenching.

Vertical shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones: effects of the full Coriolis acceleration and thermal diffusion,"Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.","['Junho Park', 'Stéphane Mathis']",15.0,21.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05293,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics', 'Fluid Dynamics']",,,['Hydrodynamics – turbulence – stars: rotation – stars: evolution 1 INTRODUCTION The rotation of stars deeply modifies their evolution (e'],2025-01-10
The Role of Atmospheric Composition in Defining the Habitable Zone Limits and Supporting E. coli Growth,"Studying exoplanet atmospheres is essential for assessing their potential to host liquid water and their capacity to support life (their habitability). Each atmosphere uniquely influences the likelihood of surface liquid water, defining the habitable zone (HZ), the region around a star where liquid water can exist. However, being within the HZ does not guarantee habitability, as life requires more than just liquid water. In this study, we adopted a two-pronged approach. First, we estimated the surface conditions of planets near the HZ's inner edge under various atmospheric compositions. By utilizing a 3D climate model, we refined the inner boundaries of the HZ for planets with atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2 for the first time. Second, we investigated microbial survival in these environments, conducting laboratory experiments on the growth and survival of E. coli K-12, focusing on the impact of different gas compositions. This innovative combination of climate modeling and biological experiments bridges theoretical climate predictions with biological outcomes. Our findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.","['Asena Kuzucan', 'Emeline Bolmont', 'Guillaume Chaverot', 'Jaqueline Quirino Ferreira', 'Bastiaan Willem Ibelings', 'Siddharth Bhatnagar', 'Daniel Frank McGinnis']",6.0,21.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05297,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['exoplanets'],2025-01-10
Forecast of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae time delay measurement by Muztage-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope,"Strong lensing time delay measurement is a promising method to address the Hubble tension, offering a completely independent approach compared to both the cosmic microwave background analysis and the local distance ladder. As a third-party examination of the Hubble tension, this method provides a unique perspective. Strongly lensed quasar (glQSO) systems have demonstrated significant potential in tackling this issue, achieving an impressive \(2\%\) accuracy level. However, advancing to \(1\%\) or sub-percent accuracy is challenging due to several intrinsic limitations of glQSOs. Fortunately, strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) offer a more robust solution, thanks to their characteristic light curve, significant brightness variations, and additional advantages. The Muztagh-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope (MOST) is an exceptional instrument for monitoring strong lensing time delays. In this study, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia systems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey Space Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with \(300s \times 9\) exposures in each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images maintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for fitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a time delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below one hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance the precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward resolving the Hubble tension.","['Guanhua Rui', 'Wenwen Zheng', 'Zizhao He', 'Yiping Shu', 'Xinzhong Er', 'Guoliang Li', 'Bin Hu']",11.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05303,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-10
The CO-Fuelled Time Machine: Tracing Birth Conditions and Terrestrial Planet Formation Outcomes in HD 163296 through Pebble Drift-induced CO Enhancements,"The architecture and composition of planetary systems are thought to be strongly influenced by the transport and delivery of dust and volatiles via ices on pebbles during the planet formation phase in protoplanetary discs. Understanding these transport mechanisms is crucial in building a comprehensive picture of planet formation, including material and chemical budget; constraining the birth properties of these discs is a key step in this process. We present a novel method of retrieving such properties by studying the transport of icy pebbles in the context of an observed gas-phase CO enhancement within the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296. We combine Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to determine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare our results against observations and models in the literature; we find the birth-condition disc gas mass to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{disc}}/M_{\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the characteristic radius to be $\log_{10}(r_{\rm{c}}/\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$. We additionally determine that dust grains must be `fragile' ($v_{f}=100~\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$) to retain enough dust to match current dust mass observations, with our lowest fragmentation velocity model providing a current-age dust mass of $\rm{M_{dust}}=662^{+518}_{-278} \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ based on the retrieved birth conditions. Using our retrieved birth conditions, we extend our simulations to mass of material reaching the water snowline in the inner disc, where terrestrial and super-Earth planets may be forming, and speculate on the nature of these exoplanets.","['Joe Williams', 'Sebastiaan Krijt']",12.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05316,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['protoplanetary discs – planets and satellites: formation 1 INTRODUCTION Understanding the full process of planet formation is a challenging task', 'consideringthevastsizeandmassscalescoveredinastronom- icallyshorttimescalesofafewmillionyears']",2025-01-10
"Martian atmospheric disturbances from orbital images and surface pressure at Jezero Crater, Mars, during Martian Year 36","We present a study of atmospheric disturbances at Jezero Crater, Mars, using ground-based measurements of surface pressure by the Perseverance rover in combination with orbital images from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. The study starts at Ls $\sim$ 13.3° in MY36 (March 6th, 2021) and extends up to Ls $\sim$ 30.3° in MY37 (February 28th, 2023). We focus on the characterization of the major atmospheric phenomena at synoptic and planetary-scales. These are the thermal tides (measured up to the sixth component), long-period pressure oscillations (periods > 1 sol), the Aphelion Cloud Belt, and the occasional development of regional dust storms over Jezero. We present the seasonal evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the thermal tides and their relation with the atmospheric dust content (optical depth). Three regional dust storms and one polar storm extending over Jezero produced an increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes but resulted in inverse responses in their phases. We show that the primary regular wave activity is due to baroclinic disturbances with periods of 2-4 sols and amplitudes $\sim$ 1-15 Pa increasing with dust content, in good agreement with theoretical predictions by model calculations. The spacecraft images show a number of arc-shaped, spiral and irregular cyclonic vortices, traced by dust and clouds at the edge of the North Polar Cap, that could be behind some of the pressure oscillations measured at Jezero.","['A.

Resolving an Asteroseismic Catastrophe: Structural Diagnostics from p-mode Phase Functions off the Main Sequence,"On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation $\delta\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily interpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an interpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating $\delta\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this estimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red giants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We derive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when applied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative features of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants. This expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale primarily with their global seismic properties as $\delta\nu_{02} \propto \Delta\nu^2/\nu_\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their internal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the transition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently reported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission data. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the convective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a third of a wavelength at $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at which point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the boundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or $r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective boundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.","['J.

Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with $\texttt{FOREST}$,"We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the ""cloud-in-cloud"" effect. In the ""quantum-well"" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.","['Chiara Animali', 'Pierre Auclair', 'Baptiste Blachier', 'Vincent Vennin']",13.0,39.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05371,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-10
MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo at high Pm numbers,"To power gamma-ray bursts and other high-energy events, large-scale magnetic fields are required to extract rotational energy from compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key mechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field amplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which angular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime reveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and buoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these findings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in stratified simulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\mathrm{Pm}$ regime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in the regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high $\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo coefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described by an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic field as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a shorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the off-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic field in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in global simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\sim 5$, which could lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in the high-Pm regime.","['Alexis Reboul-Salze', 'Loren E.

Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures,"The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS), offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrum of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation, while incorporating redshift binning. Notably, our analysis includes all Newtonian effects, leading relativistic projection effects, and general relativistic contributions, including radiation dynamics, up to second order in perturbation theory. For simplicity, however, we neglect any biasing effects. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectrum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z=0.6 \pm 0.05$, and compare our analytical results with simulations. For the contributions that already appear in a Newtonian treatment we find an interesting cancellation between the quadratic terms. At $z=2$, the projection effects and the dynamical effects have similar amplitude on large scales as we approach $k \sim \mathcal{H}$. In the squeezed limit, radiation effects are found to be the leading relativistic effects, by one order of magnitude. At $z=0.6$, we find the correct weak-field hierarchy between the terms, controlled by the ratio $\mathcal{H}/k$, but we still find that dynamical effects (from nonlinear evolution) are only a factor $2-3$ smaller than the projection effects. We compare our results with simulation measurements and find good agreement for the total bispectrum.","['Thomas Montandon', 'Enea Di Dio', 'Cornelius Rampf', 'Julian Adamek']",9.0,34.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05422,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-10

We generate 250,000 synthetic star-forming galaxies composed of up to 3000 HII regions and explore how variations in parameters affect their integrated emission-line properties. Our results highlight systematic biases in oxygen-abundance estimates derived using traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the composite nature of star-forming galaxies when interpreting integrated nebular emission.

A Disintegrating Rocky Planet with Prominent Comet-like Tails Around a Bright Star,"We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU.

Planet formation and long-term stability in a very eccentric stellar binary,"Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.","['Jakob Stegmann', 'Evgeni Grishin', 'Cole Johnston', 'Nora L.

Two light curve dips were observed; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant and the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals. Through a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included the dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization properties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes associated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%. The polarization angle showed a swing of ~70° across the dip and off-dip states, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE observation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized emission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the neutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended accretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization degrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.","['Alessandro Di Marco', 'Fabio La Monaca', 'Anna Bobrikova', 'Luigi Stella', 'Alessandro Papitto', 'Juri Poutanen', 'Maria Cristina Baglio', 'Matteo Bachetti', 'Vladislav Loktev', 'Maura Pilia', 'Daniele Rogantini']",16.0,16.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05511,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['accretion disks – polarization – stars: individual: GX 13+1 – stars: neutron – X-ray binaries 1', 'accretion']",2025-01-13
JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies,"The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z<0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.","['Sophie Lebowitz', 'Kevin Hainline', 'Stéphanie Juneau', 'Jianwei Lyu', 'Christina Williams', 'Stacey Alberts', 'Xiaohui Fan', 'Marcia Rieke']",18.0,35.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05512,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST,"Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z>3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.","['D.

"XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029","We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| < 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D ~ 0.21 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.",['XRISM Collaboration'],2.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05514,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-13
The 2D pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecular kinematics,"[Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new, unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools to study the disk pressure structure and estimate fundamental disk parameters, as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecular approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extract the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide range in the disk radial and vertical extents. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extend standard methodologies to fit multiple-component line profiles. We then sample the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtain dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$ and scale radius $ R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parametrization. Finally, we investigate the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecular approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.","['V.

A multi-frequency study of sub-parsec jets with the Event Horizon Telescope,"The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-Königl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.","['Jan Röder', 'Maciek Wielgus', 'Andrei P.

The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid,"Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions.

The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation,"State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.","['Beatriz Campos Estrada', 'David A.

Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis,"Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.","['Clelia Altomonte', 'Malcolm Fairbairn', 'Lucien Heurtier']",3.0,10.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05531,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-13
Space-based Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Ray Experiments,"Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon altitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the atmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers (EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for observing EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\sim 10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR} > ~\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence signal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the atmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades have sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim fluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally, the beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with $> ~\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic ray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy thresholds can be $> ~\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs). ...In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development from orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that have been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished by discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR spectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction.

Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system,"We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.","['George W. King', 'Lía R. Corrales', 'Vincent Bourrier', 'Leonardo A.

A New Approach for Constraining Large-Scale Temperature Fluctuations in the Intergalactic Medium,"The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim4$, marking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium reionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM between neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\sigma (\ln T) \sim \Delta T/T = 20-50\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for reionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective optical depths of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest towards a large number of background quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective optical depths in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature fluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured the distributions of effective Lyman-$\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$ X-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to $z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the simulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do not detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the simulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until the model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight constraints on $\sigma (\ln T) < 0.29 \ (<0.40)$ at $2 \sigma\ (3 \sigma)$ at $z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker constraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales. Our constraints are the tightest to date, and imply that either the IGM temperature contrast caused by helium reionization is less than $\sim30\%$, or that the process has not yet significantly started at $z=3.76$.","['Saba Etezad-Razavi', 'Sarah E.

"An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN REJ1034+396","We report the analysis of ~1Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396. The 0.3-9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically-blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence ($\Delta C\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity $v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous $0.5-2.5$\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log $N_\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) = $21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.","['Chloe Taylor', 'Daniel Wilkins', 'Steven Allen']",6.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05579,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-13
More than a void? The detection and characterization of cavities in a simulated galaxy's interstellar medium,"The interstellar medium of galaxies is filled with holes, bubbles, and shells, typically interpreted as remnants of stellar evolution. There is growing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and supernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and numerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases. Therefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities in particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the persistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points around each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the relationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that higher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities. By tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical properties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we detect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into supernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity based on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100 million years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work. Surprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be linked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are contracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million years. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the premise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study reveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters, larger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220 million years) compared to other cavities.","['Abolfazl Taghribi', 'Marco Canducci', 'Michele Mastropietro', 'Sven De Rijcke', 'Reynier Frans Peletier', 'Peter Tino', 'Kerstin Bunte']",6.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05581,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,"['and shells withawiderangeofradiiandsizes(Westerlund&Mathewson1966', 'bubbles', 'galaxies: dwarf – supernovae: general – software: data analysis 1 INTRODUCTION It has been appreciated since the late 1960s that the interstellar medium of external galaxies is filled with holes']",2025-01-13
Mind the gaps: improved methods for the detection of periodicities in unevenly-sampled data,"The detection of periodic signals in irregularly-sampled time series is a problem commonly encountered in astronomy. Traditional tools used for periodic searches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties under irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic variability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the presence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine periodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves. Here we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period searches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these problems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer an appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known distribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood to be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical methods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional, (quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the data as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the method to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be described as a Gaussian process.

The LSPE-Strip Pointing Reconstruction and Star Tracker,"This paper aims to describe the Pointing Reconstruction Model (PRM) and the prototype Star Tracker, which will be mounted on LSPE-Strip, a microwave Q- and W-band CMB telescope planned for installation at the ""Observatorio del Teide"" in Tenerife. The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude provided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing direction and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various non-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration angles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the derivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the pointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles to validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the LSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations of the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky observations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker RMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain below 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of reconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating the Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's pointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2) observations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In the first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1 arcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration accuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.","['Michele Maris', 'Maurizio Tomasi', 'Matteo Baratto', 'Fabio Paonessa', 'Cristian Franceschet', 'Daniele Tavagnacco', 'Oscar Antonio Peverini', 'Fabrizio Villa', 'Mario Zannoni', 'Marco Bersanelli', 'Barbara Caccianiga', 'Stefano Mandelli', 'Aniello Mennella', 'Federico Nati', 'Stefano Sartor', 'Ricardo T.

Phase-resolved Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 Spectroscopy of Weakly-Irradiated Brown Dwarf GD 1400 and Energy Redistribution-Irradiation Trends in Six WD$-$BD Binaries,"Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete ""Dancing with Dwarfs"" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.","['Rachael C.

Stellar obliquities of eight close-in gas giant exoplanets,"The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows us to measure the projected stellar obliquity of exoplanets. From the spin-orbit alignment, planet formation and migration theories can be tested to improve our understanding of the currently observed exoplanetary population. Despite having the spin-orbit measurements for more than 200 planets, the stellar obliquity distribution is still not fully understood, warranting additional measurements to sample the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of eight gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and derive their projected stellar obliquity $\lambda$. We report a prograde, but misaligned orbit for HAT-P-50b ($\lambda =41^\circ\ ^{+10}_{-9}$), possibly hinting at previous high-eccentricity migration given the presence of a close stellar companion. We measured sky-projected obliquities that are consistent with aligned orbits for the rest of the planets: WASP-48b ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ \pm$ 4), WASP-59b ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ ^{+20}_{-21}$), WASP-140 Ab ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ \pm$ 3), WASP-173 Ab ($\lambda =9^\circ\ \pm$ 5), TOI-2046b ($\lambda =1^\circ\ \pm$ 6), HAT-P-41 Ab ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ ^{+5}_{-6}$), and Qatar-4b ($\lambda =-13^\circ\ ^{+15}_{-19}$). We measure the true stellar obliquity $\psi$ for four systems. We infer a prograde, but misaligned, orbit for TOI-2046b with $\psi=$42$^{+10}_{-8}$\,deg. Additionally, $\psi = 30^\circ\ ^{+18}_{-15}$ for WASP-140 Ab, $\psi = 21^\circ\ ^{+9}_{-10}$ for WASP-173 Ab, and $\psi = 32^\circ\ ^{+14}_{-13}$ for Qatar-4b. The aligned orbits are consistent with slow disk migration, ruling out violent events that would excite the orbits over the history of these systems. Finally, we provide a new age estimate for TOI-2046 of at least 700 Myr and for Qatar-4 of at least 350-500 Myr, contradicting previous results.","['J. Zak', 'H. M. J. Boffin', 'E. Sedaghati', 'A.

"OpenUniverse2024: A shared, simulated view of the sky for the next generation of cosmological surveys","The OpenUniverse2024 simulation suite is a cross-collaboration effort to produce matched simulated imaging for multiple surveys as they would observe a common simulated sky. Both the simulated data and associated tools used to produce it are intended to uniquely enable a wide range of studies to maximize the science potential of the next generation of cosmological surveys. We have produced simulated imaging for approximately 70 deg$^2$ of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep survey and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, as well as overlapping versions of the ELAIS-S1 Deep-Drilling Field for LSST and the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey for Roman. OpenUniverse2024 includes i) an early version of the updated extragalactic model called Diffsky, which substantially improves the realism of optical and infrared photometry of objects, compared to previous versions of these models; ii) updated transient models that extend through the wavelength range probed by Roman and Rubin; and iii) improved survey, telescope, and instrument realism based on up-to-date survey plans and known properties of the instruments. It is built on a new and updated suite of simulation tools that improves the ease of consistently simulating multiple observatories viewing the same sky. The approximately 400 TB of synthetic survey imaging and simulated universe catalogs are publicly available, and we preview some scientific uses of the simulations.","['OpenUniverse', 'LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration', 'Roman HLIS Project Infrastructure Team', 'Roman RAPID Project Infrastructure Team', 'Roman Supernova Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team', 'A.

The Emerging Class of Double-Faced White Dwarfs,"We report our findings on a spectroscopic survey of seven unresolved DA+DB binary white dwarf candidates. We have discovered extreme spectroscopic variations in one of these candidates, SDSS J084716.21+484220.40. Previous analysis failed to reproduce the optical spectrum using a single object with a homogeneous atmosphere. Our time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a double-faced white dwarf that switches between a DBA and DA spectral type over 6.5 or 8.9 hours due to varying surface abundances. We also provide time-series spectroscopy of the magnetic DBA, SDSS J085618.94+161103.6 (LB 8915), and confirm an inhomogeneous atmosphere. We employ an atmosphere model with hydrogen caps and a helium belt that yields excellent fits to our time-resolved spectra. We use the oblique rotator model to derive the system geometry for both targets. With the addition of these two objects, the emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs now consists of seven members. We summarize the properties of this new class of objects, and discuss how magnetism impacts the convective processes and leads to the formation of double-faced white dwarfs. We identify cooler versions of white dwarfs with inhomogeneous atmospheres among the cool magnetic DA white dwarf sample, where the H$\alpha$ line is shallower than expected based on pure hydrogen atmosphere models.","['Adam Moss', 'Mukremin Kilic', 'Pierre Bergeron', 'Gracyn Jewett', 'Warren Brown']",9.0,14.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05649,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cell-based Coadds and Metadetection Weak Lensing Shape Catalogue,"We present the Metadetection weak lensing galaxy shape catalogue from the six-year Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) imaging data. This dataset is the final release from DES, spanning 4422 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe how the catalogue was constructed, including the two new major processing steps, cell-based image coaddition and shear measurements with Metadetection. The DES Y6 Metadetection weak lensing shape catalogue consists of 151,922,791 galaxies detected over riz bands, with an effective number density of $n_{\rm eff}$ =8.22 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ and shape noise of $\sigma_e$ = 0.29. We carry out a suite of validation tests on the catalogue, including testing for PSF leakage, testing for the impact of PSF modeling errors, and testing the correlation of the shear measurements with galaxy, PSF, and survey properties. In addition to demonstrating that our catalogue is robust for weak lensing science, we use the DES Y6 image simulation suite (Mau, Becker et al. 2025) to estimate the overall multiplicative shear bias of our shear measurement pipeline. We find no detectable multiplicative bias at the roughly half-percent level, with m = (3.4 $\pm$ 6.1) x $10^{-3}$, at 3$\sigma$ uncertainty. This is the first time both cell-based coaddition and Metadetection algorithms are applied to observational data, paving the way to the Stage-IV weak lensing surveys.","['M. Yamamoto', 'M. R.

A new algorithm for detecting X-ray shots in Cyg X-1,"The short-term X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 can be interpreted as random occurrence of mini-flares known as the shots, whose physical nature is still unclear. We propose a new algorithm for shot identification in the X-ray light curve, based on baseline detection and template fitting. Compared with previous techniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and shorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after correction for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence rate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate has a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher mass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots. We also find that the abrupt hardening near the shot peak found in previous studies is attributed to different shot profiles in different energy bands; there is no need to involve a rapid physical process to suddenly harden the emitting spectrum.","['Jin Qin', 'Hua Feng', 'Lian Tao']",8.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05679,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog,"Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.","['D. Anbajagane', 'M. Tabbutt', 'J. Beas-Gonzalez', 'B. Yanny', 'S. Everett', 'M. R. Becker', 'M. Yamamoto', 'E. Legnani', 'J. De Vicente', 'K.

Optical frequency comb integration in radio telescopes: advancing signal generation and phase calibration,"Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.","['Minji Hyun', 'Changmin Ahn', 'Junyong Choi', 'Jihoon Baek', 'Woosong Jeong', 'Do-Heung Je', 'Do-Young Byun', 'Jan Wagner', 'Myoung-Sun Heo', 'Taehyun Jung', 'Jungwon Kim']",7.0,25.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05691,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Instrumentation and Detectors', 'Optics']",,,[],2025-01-13

Exoplanet Ephemerides Change Observations (ExoEcho). I. Transit Timing Analysis of Thirty-Seven Exoplanets using HST/WFC3 Data,"The ExoEcho project is designed to study the photodynamics of exoplanets by leveraging high-precision transit timing data from ground- and space-based telescopes. Some exoplanets are experiencing orbital decay, and transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful technique to study their orbital period variations. In this study, we have obtained transit middle-time data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for 37 short-period exoplanets, most of which are hot Jupiters. To search for potential long- and short-term orbital period variations within the sample, we conduct TTV model fitting using both linear and quadratic ephemeris models. Our analysis identifies two hot Jupiters experiencing strong periodic decays. Given the old age of the host stars of the hot Jupiter population, our findings call for a scenario where HJs are continuously being destructed and created. Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating high-precision transit timing data to TTV study in the future.","['Xinyue Ma', 'Wenqin Wang', 'Zixin Zhang', 'Cong Yu', 'Dichang Chen', 'Jiwei Xie', 'Shangfei Liu', 'Li Zhou', 'Bo Ma']",7.0,21.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05704,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Exoplanet systems — Transit photometry — Transit timing variation method 1'],2025-01-13
Expanding Molecular Shell and Possible {\gamma}-ray Source Associated with Supernova Remnant Kesteven 67,"We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.","['Yun-Zhi Shen', 'Yang Chen', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Tian-Yu Tu', 'Wen-Juan Zhong', 'Qian-Qian Zhang', 'Qian-Cheng Liu']",10.0,14.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05725,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['ISM:Individual objects: Kes 67(G18'],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Photometric Data Set for Cosmology,"We describe the photometric data set assembled from the full six years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in support of static-sky cosmology analyses. DES Y6 Gold is a curated data set derived from DES Data Release 2 (DR2) that incorporates improved measurement, photometric calibration, object classification and value added information. Y6 Gold comprises nearly $5000~{\rm deg}^2$ of $grizY$ imaging in the south Galactic cap and includes 669 million objects with a depth of $i_{AB} \sim 23.4$ mag at S/N $\sim 10$ for extended objects and a top-of-the-atmosphere photometric uniformity $< 2~{\rm mmag}$. Y6 Gold augments DES DR2 with simultaneous fits to multi-epoch photometry for more robust galaxy shapes, colors, and photometric redshift estimates. Y6 Gold features improved morphological star-galaxy classification with efficiency $98.6\%$ and contamination $0.8\%$ for galaxies with $17.5 < i_{AB} < 22.5$. Additionally, it includes per-object quality information, and accompanying maps of the footprint coverage, masked regions, imaging depth, survey conditions, and astrophysical foregrounds that are used for cosmology analyses. After quality selections, benchmark samples contain 448 million galaxies and 120 million stars. This paper will be complemented by online data access and documentation.","['K. Bechtol', 'I.

$\Lambda$CDM model against redshift-binned data: A mock analysis based on SNIa and Cosmic Chronometers,"Despite the broad successes of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and its fitness to the various cosmological observations, it confronts challenges stemming from anomalies in the measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$).

This study pioneers a new investigation to probe this redshift dependency by generating mock data simulated from observational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and cosmic chronometers (CC), thereby increasing the data density in this field. By sorting the data into high-redshift and low-redshift bins, we aim to refine the cosmological constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model and determine whether the noted dependence on redshift is due to a lack of high-redshift observational data or if they signify intrinsic issues within the model itself. Our approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to minimize the $\chi^2$ function, thus tightening the cosmological constraints. Our findings within the mock analysis reveal discrepancies between the values of $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ derived from the mock data bins with high redshift and low redshift, indicating the potential deviation of the standard $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology from the high-redshift SNIa and CC data. If this deviation proposes a new physics beyond the standard model, then with better quality future data tracking the new physics, these discrepancies will be statistically significant.","['Saeed Pourojaghi', 'Mohammad Malekjani']",12.0,11.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05740,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['Dark energy', 'Cosmology', 'Cosmological parameters 1', 'standardΛCDM cosmology']",2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-Spread Function Modeling,"We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C.

The elderly among the oldest: new evidence for extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars,"We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of three extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars, exploring uncharted territories at these low metallicities for this class of stars. Using high-resolution spectra acquired with HARPS-N at TNG, UVES at VLT, and PEPSI at LBT, and employing Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis calculations, we provide abundance measurements for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Sr. Our findings indicate that the stars have metallicities of [Fe/H] = -3.40 \pm 0.05, -3.28 \pm 0.02, and -2.77 \pm 0.05 for HD 331986, DO Hya, and BPS CS 30317-056, respectively. Additionally, we derived their kinematic and dynamical properties to gain insights into their origins. Interestingly, the kinematics of one star (HD 331986) is consistent with the Galactic disc, while the others exhibit Galactic halo kinematics, albeit with distinct chemical signatures. We compared the [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Mn] ratios of the current targets with recent literature estimates to determine whether these stars were either accreted or formed in situ, finding that the adopted chemical diagnostics are ineffective at low metallicities ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -$1.5). Finally, the established horizontal branch evolutionary models, indicating that these stars arrive at hotter temperatures on the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and then transition into RR Lyrae stars as they evolve, fully support the existence of such low-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. As a consequence, we can anticipate detecting more of them when larger samples of spectra become available from upcoming extensive observational campaigns.","[""Valentina D'Orazi"", 'Vittorio F.

Census of Ly$\alpha$ Emission from $\sim 600$ Galaxies at $z=5-14$: Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Luminosity Function and a Late Sharp Cosmic Reionization,"We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.","['Yuta Kageura', 'Masami Ouchi', 'Minami Nakane', 'Hiroya Umeda', 'Yuichi Harikane', 'Shintaro Yoshiura', 'Kimihiko Nakajima', 'Hidenobu Yajima', 'Tran Thi Thai']",18.0,45.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05834,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['Galaxy evolution (594)', 'Lyman-alpha galaxies (978)', 'Reion- ization (1383) 1', 'High-redshift galaxies (734)']",2025-01-13
Black hole-disc coevolution in the presence of magnetic fields: refining the Thorne limit with emission from within the plunging region,"The accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.",['Andrew Mummery'],5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05843,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,"['profoundly modify the properties of the black hole itself', 'provided a sufficiently large reservoir of material is available', 'accretion', 'accretion discs — black hole physics 1 INTRODUCTION The addition of material onto a black hole via an accretion flow will']",2025-01-13
Extreme exomoons in WASP-49 Ab: dynamics and detectability,"WASP-49Ab, a low-density, Saturn-like planet in a tight orbit around a Sun-like star within a wide binary system, is a compelling candidate for hosting a volcanic moon, as suggested by the detection of Doppler-shiftedthis http URLstudy evaluates the stability of potential satellites around WASP-49Ab under the influence of planetary oblateness, relativistic effects, and perturbations from a close companion star, focusing on their impact on light curve parameters such as transit duration and impact parameter variations, driven by the evolution of the planet's orbit in this extreme environment. Using N-body simulations and semi-analytical methods, we analysed moon's dynamics across varied initial conditions and gravitational frameworks including the potential of an oblate planet and the effects of the general relativity. We find that `selenity', a moon survival indicator, is high in close orbits with low eccentricity, near the Roche limit, especially for masses greater than Io's. Stability decreases as eccentricity or distance from the planet increases. Additionally, We observe a strong destabilising resonance near 1.4 planetary radii when planetary eccentricities are slightly greater than zero. This study confirms the potential for stable exomoons around WASP-49Ab despite its hostile environment, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse physical effects in stability analyses, aiding future detection efforts.","['Mario Sucerquia', 'Nicolás Cuello.']",2.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05866,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters,,['planets and satellites: detection – methods: numerical – planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability – stars: individual: WASP-49 1'],2025-01-13
BASSET: Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit -- Optimized Sub-Band Pulse Search Strategies for Faint Narrow-Band FRBs,"The existing single-pulse search algorithms for fast radio bursts (FRBs) do not adequately consider the frequency bandpass pattern of the pulse, rendering them incomplete for the relatively narrow-spectrum detection of pulses. We present a new search algorithm for narrow-band pulses to update the existing standard pipeline, Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit (BASSET). The BASSET employs a time-frequency correlation analysis to identify and remove the noise involved by the zero-detection frequency band, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pulses. The BASSET algorithm was implemented on the FAST real dataset of FRB 20190520B, resulting in the discovery of additional 79 pulses through reprocessing. The new detection doubles the number of pulses compared to the previously known 75 pulses, bringing the total number of pulses to 154. In conjunction with the pulse calibration and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulated injection experiments, this work updates the quantified parameter space of the detection rate. Moreover, a parallel-accelerated version of the BASSET code was provided and evaluated through simulation. BASSET has the capacity of enhancing the detection sensitivity and the SNR of the narrow-band pulses from the existing pipeline, offering high performance and flexible applicability. BASSET not only enhances the completeness of the low-energy narrow-band pulse detection in a more robust mode, but also has the potential to further elucidate the FRB luminosity function at a wider energy scale.","['J.-H.

Smuggling unnoticed: Towards a 2D view of water and dust delivery to the inner regions of protoplanetary discs,"Infrared spectroscopy, e.g., with JWST, provides a glimpse into the chemical inventory of the innermost region of protoplanetary discs, where terrestrial planets eventually form. The chemical make-up of regions inside snowlines is connected to the material drifting from the outer regions, which can be modeled with dust evolution models. However, infrared observations are limited by the high dust extinction in the inner disc, and only probes the abundances of gaseous species in the disc surface layers. As a result, the bulk mass of delivered volatiles is not directly relatable to what is measured through infrared spectra. In this paper, we investigate how the delivery of dust and ice after prolonged pebble drift affects the observable reservoir of water vapor in the inner disc. We develop a 1+1D approach based on dust evolution models to determine the delivery and distribution of vapor compared to the height of the $\tau = 1$ surface in the dust continuum. We find that the observable column density of water vapor at wavelengths probed by JWST spans many orders of magnitude over time, exhibiting different radial profiles depending on dust properties, drift rate, and local processing. In the presence of a traffic-jam effect inside the snowline, the observable vapor reservoir appears constant in time despite the ongoing delivery by pebble drift, such that water is effectively smuggled unnoticed. Differences in measured column densities then originate not only from variations in bulk vapor content, but also from differences in the properties and distribution of dust particles.","['Adrien Houge', 'Sebastiaan Krijt', 'Andrea Banzatti', 'Geoffrey A.

Characterisation of H$\beta$ spectra from EXO 051910+3737.7 X-rays binaries,"We investigate the spectral characteristics of the Be/X-ray binary system, EXO 051910+3737.7, in which Be/X-ray systems are the largest sub-class of high-mass X-ray binaries. Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai National Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES) instrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021. Our primary focus is directed towards the analysis of two Balmer lines, namely H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, given that Be stars typically exhibit emission features in at least one of these hydrogen Balmer lines during certain phases. Our observations reveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our monitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to characterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines indicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then analyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R variation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed rapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the precise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the duration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength differences ($\Delta\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters allowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\beta}$) of the H$\beta$ emitting envelope. The average value was calculated to be 2.585$r_*$, with a standard deviation of 0.050$r_*$.","['Pornisara Nuchvanichakul', 'Puji Irawati', 'Pakakaew Rittipruk', 'Poshak Gandhi', 'Christian Knigge', 'Phil Charles', 'Suwicha Wannawichian']",6.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05883,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,"TRENDS IN SCIENCES, 2024; 21(9): 7653","['suchasaneutronstarorablackhole', 'High-mass X-ray binaries', 'Be stars', 'Spectral characteristics', 'Emission line Introduction High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are binary systems where a massive OB-star is held in orbit by acompactobject']",2025-01-13
Estimating variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series,"A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift.

Dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk,"Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets. Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is crucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so far the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of young planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8 micron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those obtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.","['Yao Liu', 'Dafa Li', 'Hongchi Wang', 'Haoran Feng', 'Min Fang', 'Fujun Du', 'Thomas Henning', 'Giulia Perotti']",5.0,12.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05913,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-13

Comparing radial migration in dark matter and MOND regimes,"Multiple studies on radial migration in disc galaxies have proven the importance of the effect of resonances with non-axisymmetric components on the evolution of galactic discs. However, the dynamical effects of classic Newtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM) differ from MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and might trigger different radial migration. A thorough analysis of radial migration considering these two gravitational regimes might shed some light on different predictions of DM and MOND theories. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the effects of resonances and stellar radial migration (churning) in a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy in the DM and MOND regimes. We performed simulations of a MW-like galaxy to analyse the effect of non-axisymmetric structures (galactic bar and spiral arms) considering various parameters of the spiral structure. We conducted a two-dimensional numerical simulation consisting of the integration of $2 \cdot 10^6$ stars in a static rotating galactic potential for $6~\mbox{Gyr}$. We analysed the change in the star's position, the guiding radius, as well as the frequency phase space. We investigated DM and MOND approaches. The outcome of the simulation shows that the radial migration is much more pronounced in the MOND regime compared to the DM one. Compared to the DM approach, in the MOND regime, we observe up to five times as many stars with a maximum change in the guiding radius of more than $1.5~\mbox{kpc}$ during the time interval from $2-6~\mbox{Gyr}$.Analysis of the frequency phase space reveals that the most prominent resonances in all DM and MOND configurations are the co-rotation resonance with the spiral arms ($m=p=1$), outer Lindblad resonance with the galactic bar and spiral arms, and the co-rotation resonance ($m=2$, $p=1$) with the superposition of the galactic bar and spiral arms, $2 \Omega = \Omega_b + \Omega_{sp}$.","['R.

Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS 1809-193: Gamma-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?,"Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809-193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3-1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809-193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The {\gamma}-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809-193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3-1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809-193 and J1810.31925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809-193.","['Jiaxu Sun', 'Yang Chen', 'Yiwei Bao', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Xin Zhou']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05944,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Pulsar wind nebulae', 'Gamma-ray sources', 'Supernova remnants', 'Cosmic rays 1']",2025-01-13
The CIELO Project: The Chemo-dynamical properties of gaLaxies and the cosmic web,"The CIELO project introduces a novel set of chemo-dynamical zoom-in simulations designed to simultaneously resolve galaxies and their nearby environments.

Fast Multi-tone Phase Calibration Signal Extraction,"This paper discusses a fast algorithm for analyzing the phases of a multi-tone phase calibration signal. The multi-tone method is superior to its single-tone counterpart. The PCal signal is a wide-band frequency comb derived from an ultra-stable frequency standard which is then coupled into the input stage of the radio astronomy receiver chain. The frequency comb allows to determine the signal delay, frequency response and phase shifts induced by the radio telescope instrumentation. The instrumentation delay is one of the several delay components that have to be compensated for in multi-telescope aperture synthesis. The frequency response also helps to monitor the instrumentation. To extract the information from the digitized baseband output of the receiver chain calls for fast numerical methods. A simple fast algorithm is presented in this paper. Two implementations are provided. One is based on precomputed look-up tables. The other is based on fast digital sinewave generators. Both lend themselves to parallel software processing on multi-core and SIMD-capable platforms as well as processing with FPGA gateware.

SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons,"The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available atthis https URL.","['Nikolas Frediani', 'Michael Krämer', 'Philipp Mertsch', 'Kathrin Nippel']",13.0,25.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06011,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Computational Physics']",,,[],2025-01-13
Timing and spectral studies of the Be/X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 using Insight-HXMT observations,"We report the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the high mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 during the 2021 type-II outburst based on the Insight-HXMT observations. Pulsations can be detected in the energy band of 1-150 keV. The pulse profile shows energy and luminosity dependence and variability. We observed transitions in the pulse profile shape during the rising and the decaying phase of the outburst. The pulse fraction exhibits an anti-correlation with luminosity and a non-monotonic energy dependence, with a possible dip near 30 keV during the outburst peak. The hardness-intensity diagrams (7-10 keV/4-7 keV) suggest state transitions during the early and late phases of the outburst. These transitions are consistent with the luminosity at which the pulse profile shape changes occur, revealing the source reaching the critical luminosity and transitioning between super-critical and sub-critical accretion regimes. We performed the average and phase-resolved spectral analysis, where the flux-resolved average spectra show a stable spectral evolution with luminosity. The phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the dependence of spectral parameters on the pulse phase varies with different luminosities.","['Yu-Jia Du', 'Lorenzo Ducci', 'Long Ji', 'Qing-Cui Bu', 'Ling-Da Kong', 'Peng-Ju Wang', 'Youli Tuo', 'Andrea Santangelo']",10.0,11.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06013,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['X-rays:binaries – pulsars: individual: EXO 2030 +375 1'],2025-01-13
Thermal emission from bow shocks III: Variable diffuse X-ray emission from stellar-wind bow shocks driven by dynamical instabilities,"X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and lightcurves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.","['Jonathan Mackey', 'Arun Mathew', 'Ahmad A.

Modern Bayesian Sampling Methods for Cosmological Inference: A Comparative Study,"We present a comprehensive comparison of different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, evaluating their performance on both standard test problems and cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis includes traditional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), slice sampling, nested sampling as implemented in dynesty, and PolyChord. We examine samplers through multiple metrics including runtime, memory usage, effective sample size, and parameter accuracy, testing their scaling with dimension and response to different probability distributions. While all samplers perform well with simple Gaussian distributions, we find that HMC and nested sampling show advantages for more complex distributions typical of cosmological problems. Traditional MCMC and slice sampling become less efficient in higher dimensions, while nested methods maintain accuracy but at higher computational cost. In cosmological applications using BAO data, we observe similar patterns, with particular challenges arising from parameter degeneracies and poorly constrained parameters.",['Denitsa Staicova'],5.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06022,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-13
Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters,"This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of ""escaper"" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.","['Grzegorz Wiktorowicz', 'Mirek Giersz', 'Abbas Askar', 'Arkadiusz Hypki', 'Lucas Helstrom']",3.0,13.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06037,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['stellar dynamics – methods: numerical – globular clusters: evolution – X-ray: binaries 1'],2025-01-13
ZF-UDS-7329: a Relic Galaxy in the Early Universe,"The formation time-scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways, by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, both methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering $\alpha$-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations that prevent us from accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analyse the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z$\sim$3.2 and show that we can achieve the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time-scales using stellar population synthesis by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare it to the well known relic galaxy NGC 1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.","['Eduardo A.

Periodic Variability of the Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae Surveyed through the Zwicky Transient Facility,"A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.","['Pinjian Chen', 'Xuan Fang', 'Xiaodian Chen', 'Jifeng Liu']",16.0,27.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06056,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],ApJ,,['Planetary nebulae (1249) — Planetary nebulae nuclei (1250) — Binary stars (154) — Close binary stars (254) — Stellar evolution (1599) 1'],2025-01-13
The ultraviolet luminosity function of star-forming galaxies between redshifts of 0.4 and 0.6,"We combine ultraviolet imaging of the 13H survey field, taken with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor telescope (XMM-OM) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) in the UVM2 band, to measure rest-frame ultraviolet 1500A luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.6. In total the UVM2 imaging covers a sky area of 641 square arcmin, and we detect 273 galaxies in the UVM2 image with 0.4<z<0.6. The luminosity function is fit by a Schechter function with best-fit values for the faint end slope alpha = -1.8 +0.4 -0.3 and characteristic absolute magnitude M* = -19.1 +0.3 -0.4. In common with XMM-OM based studies at higher redshifts, our best-fitting value for M* is fainter than previous measurements. We argue that the purging of active galactic nuclei from the sample, facilitated by the co-spatial X-ray survey carried out with XMM-Newton is important for the determination of M*. At the brightest absolute magnitudes (M1500<-18.5) the average UV colour of our galaxies is consistent with that of minimal-extinction local analogues, but the average UV colour is redder for galaxies at fainter absolute magnitudes, suggesting that higher levels of dust attenuation enter the sample at absolute magnitudes somewhat fainter than M*.","['M.

Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity,"We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.",['Matthew R.

SkyReconNet: A Deep Learning Inpainting Approach for Enhanced CMB Map Reconstruction,"We introduce a novel neural network architecture, SkyReconNet, which is tailored to reconstruct missing information in the masked regions of the full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting the CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. Our network addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of the dilated convolutional layers, with their expanded receptive fields and standard convolutional layers, to capture both the global and local features in a CMB map. This hybrid design enables our network to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions by effectively leveraging the information from the surrounding unmasked areas. The network is trained on simulated CMB maps generated using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) package. The galactic region of these simulated maps are excluded using the Planck 2018 common mask provided by the Planck CMB mission. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the full-sky CMB map, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool in CMB and other cosmological analyses.","['Reyhan D.

The GALAH survey: Improving chemical abundances using star clusters,"Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the fourth data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refitted spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, respectively, and publish a detrended catalogue. While we couldn't pinpoint the trends' origins, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the extent of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.","['Janez Kos', 'Sven Buder', 'Kevin L.

Understanding what helium absorption tells us about atmospheric escape from exoplanets,"Atmospheric escape is now considered the major contributing factor in shaping the demographic of detected exoplanets. However, inferences about the exoplanet populations strongly depend on the accuracy of the models. Direct observational tests of atmospheric models are still in their infancy. Helium escape from planetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe, already observed in $\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the basic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to predict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the atmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by implementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow. Importantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the triplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption is dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a measure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for planets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in the atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations by recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest that excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width, which is positively correlated with the mass loss rate. We also show that the helium absorption scales with incident radiation, particularly with the XEUV to FUV flux ratios.","['Giulia Ballabio', 'James E.

Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry,"The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.","['Rachel E.

Using a minimally parametrised SHAM to constrain the link between dark matter and galaxies,"Models of the galaxy-halo connection are needed to understand both galaxy clusters and large scale structure. To make said models, we need a robust method that assigns galaxies to halos and matches the observed and simulated stellar-halo mass relation. We employ an empirical Subhalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) model implemented in the halos module of SkyPy which assigns blue and red galaxies based on the Peng et al. (2010) (arXiv:1003.4747v2) model containing three parameters: $M_\mu$ (halo mass where half the galaxies assigned should be quenched), $\sigma$ (transition width from star forming to quenched) and $b$ (baseline quenched fraction at low mass). We test two sets of galaxy stellar mass functions for four populations of galaxies (central/satellite, blue/red) and run parameter estimation using Approximate Bayesian Computation over each model when compared to a set of applicable literature models. For the Weigel et al. (2016) (arXiv:1604.00008v1) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.94^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma = 0.49^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.31^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. For the Birrer et al. (2014) (arXiv:1401.3162v2) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.93^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, $\sigma = 0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Overall, we demonstrate that these constraints produce a model that is consistent with literature models for the central galaxies.

QPEs as Lense-Thirring precession of super-Eddington flows,"Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.","['M. Middleton', 'A. Gurpide', 'T. M. Kwan', 'L. Dai', 'R. Arcodia', 'J.

The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity${-}$Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus${-}$Auriga YSOs,"We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.","['Ramisa Akther Rahman', 'Joshua Bennett Lovell', 'Eric W.

"A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud","We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 x 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2-1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density ({\Sigma}dust) from far-IR emission, the H I column density (N(HI)) from the 21cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V )) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with {\Sigma}dust and I(CO), and less so with N(HI) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 Å bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ~200 lines of sight that are 2175 Å bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction-distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.","['Petia Yanchulova Merica-Jones', 'Karl Gordon', 'Karin Sandstrom', 'Claire E.

LensNet: Enhancing Real-time Microlensing Event Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks in the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network,"Traditional microlensing event vetting methods require highly trained human experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.","['Javier Viaña', 'Kyu-Ha Hwang', 'Zoë de Beurs', 'Jennifer C.

VIRAC2: NIR Astrometry and Time Series Photometry for 500M+ Stars from the VVV and VVVX Surveys,"We present VIRAC2, a catalogue of positions, proper motions, parallaxes and $Z$, $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ near-infrared photometric time series of 545 346 537 unique stars. The catalogue is based on a point spread function fitting reduction of nearly a decade of VISTA VVV and VVVX images, which cover $560~{\rm deg}^2$ of the Southern Galactic plane and bulge. The catalogue is complete at the $>90$ per cent level for $11<K_s~{\rm mag}<16$ sources, but extends to $K_s\approx{}17.5$ mag in most fields. Astrometric performance for $11<K_s~{\rm mag}<14$ sources is typically $\approx{}0.37~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ per dimension for proper motion, and $1~{\rm mas}$ for parallax. At $K_s=16$ the equivalent values are around $1.5~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ and $5~{\rm mas}$. These uncertainties are validated against Gaia DR3 and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. The complete catalogues are available via the ESO archive. We perform an initial search of the catalogue for nearby ultracool dwarf candidates. In total we find 26 new sources whose parallaxes place them within 50 parsecs of the Sun. Among them we find two high-confidence T dwarfs and a number of other sources that appear to lie close to the L/T transition.","['Leigh C. Smith', 'Philip W. Lucas', 'Sergey E.

Goku: A 10-Parameter Simulation Suite for Cosmological Emulation,"We present Goku, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the corresponding 10-dimensional emulator, GokuEmu, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. The simulations span the base parameters of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and its extensions, including dynamical dark energy ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Designed within the MF-Box framework, which integrates multi-scale and multi-fidelity simulations, the suite includes high-fidelity simulations evolving $3000^3$ particles in $1\,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$ volumes and low-fidelity simulations with $750^3$ particles across varying box sizes. This approach achieves percent-level accuracy in high-likelihood regions and 5% accuracy across broader parameter ranges, while reducing computational costs by over 90% compared to single-fidelity methods.The simulations adopt an accurate treatment of massive neutrinos, enhancing predictions of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales. Key innovations include an adaptive sampling strategy and the use of beam search to optimize generalization accuracy. The emulator is valid for redshifts $z \leq 3$ and scales $0.01 \lesssim k / (h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}) \lesssim 10$. Beyond the matter power spectrum, the simulations also support analyses of other statistical measures, such as the halo mass function. The emulator and its training data are publicly available atthis https URL, providing a valuable resource for cosmological parameter inference and model testing.","['Yanhui Yang', 'Simeon Bird', 'Ming-Feng Ho']",20.0,29.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06296,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-14
Improved SED-Fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-Out Quenching at $z\sim0.5$ and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at $z\sim1$,"Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star-formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multi-band flux profiles measured from Hubble images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4<z<1.5$ of stellar masses $10^{10}-10^{11.5}\ M_{\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. This results in SFR and $A_V$ profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and $A_V$ profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at $z\sim1.3$ are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.9$, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 - 0.08~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at $z\sim0.9$ and quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. The former are shallower at all masses by $\sim0.1~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at $z\sim1$ quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ quench from the inside-out.","['Alexander de la Vega', 'Susan A.

Constraints on Primordial Magnetic Fields from the Lyman-{\alpha} forest,"We present the first constraints on primordial magnetic fields from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest using full cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. At the scales and redshifts probed by the data, the flux power spectrum is extremely sensitive to the extra power induced by primordial magnetic fields in the linear matter power spectrum, at a scale that we parametrize with $k_{\rm peak}$. We rely on a set of more than a quarter million flux models obtained by varying thermal, reionization histories and cosmological parameters. We find a hint of extra power that is well fitted by the PMF model with $B\sim 0.2$ nG, corresponding to $k_{\rm peak}\sim 20$ Mpc$^{-1}$. However, when applying very conservative assumptions on the modelling of the noise, we obtain a 3$\sigma$ C.L. lower limit $k_{\rm peak}> 30$ Mpc$^{-1}$ which translates into the tightest bounds on the strength of primordial intergalactic magnetic fields: $B < 0.30$ nG (for fixed, nearly scale-invariant $n_{\rm B}=-2.9$).","['Mak Pavičević', 'Vid Iršič', 'Matteo Viel', 'James Bolton', 'Martin G.

"Deep radio interferometric search for decametre radio emission from the exoplanet Tau Bo\""otis b","Detection of electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission from exoplanets in the 10-40 MHz radio band is likely the only way to measure an exoplanet's magnetic field directly. However, no definitive detection of exoplanetary ECM emission has been made to date. A detection of the hot Jupiter Tau Boötis b was reported but with an observing mode that is not immune to confusion from off-axis interference, making the detection tentative. We searched for radio emissions from Tau Boötis b using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in interferometric mode, which employs direction-of-arrival information to discriminate genuine signals from interference. Our aim was to confirm the previous tentative detection or establish an upper limit in the case of a non-detection. We conducted observations using LOFAR's Low Band Antenna in interferometric mode, which totalled 64, hours spread over 8, nights. We created a custom data-processing pipeline to mitigate common challenges in decametric radio astronomy, including radio frequency interference, ionospheric distortions, and sidelobe noise from nearby bright radio sources. We used this pipeline to image the field around Tau Boötis b, searching for both quiescent and bursting emission from the direction of Tau Boötis b. Despite the high sensitivity of the interferometric observations and extensive data processing, no significant emission was detected from Tau Boötis b in Stokes V. We establish an upper limit of 2 sigma at 24 mJy for any continuous emission from the exoplanet. The previous tentative detection of 400 mJy is thus not confirmed by the interferometric observations. The previous tentative detection is unlikely to be a bona fide astrophysical signal. Our upper limit is lower than the flux density predicted by scaling laws, meaning either the scaling laws need to be revised or the emission from this particular system is beamed away from Earth.","['C.M.

WISDOM Project -- XXII. A 5% precision CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 383,"We present a measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of the nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 383, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with an angular resolution of $0.''050\times0.''024$ ($\approx16\times8$ pc$^2$). These observations spatially resolve the nuclear molecular gas disc down to $\approx41,300$ Schwarzschild radii and the SMBH sphere of influence by a factor of $\approx24$ radially, better than any other SMBH mass measurement using molecular gas to date. The high resolution enables us to probe material with a maximum circular velocity of $\approx1040$ km/s, even higher than those of the highest-resolution SMBH mass measurements using megamasers. We detect a clear Keplerian increase (from the outside in) of the line-of-sight rotation velocities, a slight offset between the gas disc kinematic (i.e. the position of the SMBH) and morphological (i.e. the centre of the molecular gas emission) centres, an asymmetry of the innermost rotation velocity peaks and evidence for a mild position angle warp and/or non-circular motions within the central $\approx0.''3$. By forward modelling the mass distribution and ALMA data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(3.58\pm0.19)\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), more precise ($5\%$) but consistent within $\approx1.4\sigma$ with the previous measurement using lower-resolution molecular gas data. Our measurement emphasises the importance of high spatial resolution observations for precise SMBH mass determinations.","['Hengyue Zhang', 'Martin Bureau', 'Ilaria Ruffa', 'Michele Cappellari', 'Timothy A.

Continuum Reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks Only With Sufficient X-ray Luminosity and Low Albedo,"Disk continuum reverberation mapping is one of the primary ways we learn about active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Reverberation mapping assumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive variability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags between X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent reverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as weakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and evidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how X-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform 3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray reprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated opacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation. We find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray irradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the reprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed, although linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray reprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock lags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing. Finally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by a factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the discrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.","['Amy Secunda', 'Yan-Fei Jiang', 'Jenny E.

VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts,"The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG).

Morphological Classification of Galaxies Through Structural and Star Formation Parameters Using Machine Learning,"We employ the XGBoost machine learning (ML) method for the morphological classification of galaxies into two (early-type, late-type) and five (E, S0--S0a, Sa--Sb, Sbc--Scd, Sd--Irr) classes, using a combination of non-parametric ($C,\,A,\,S,\,A_S,\,\mathrm{Gini},\,M_{20},\,c_{5090}$), parametric (Sérsic index, $n$), geometric (axial ratio, $BA$), global colour ($g-i,\,u-r,\,u-i$), colour gradient ($\Delta (g - i)$), and asymmetry gradient ($\Delta A_{9050}$) information, all estimated for a local galaxy sample ($z<0.15$) compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. We train the XGBoost model and evaluate its performance through multiple standard metrics. Our findings reveal better performance when utilizing all fourteen parameters, achieving accuracies of 88\% and 65\% for the two-class and five-class classification tasks, respectively. In addition, we investigate a hierarchical classification approach for the five-class scenario, combining three XGBoost classifiers. We observe comparable performance to the ``direct'' five-class classification, with discrepancies of only up to 3\%. Using SHAP (an advanced interpretation tool), we analyse how galaxy parameters impact the model's classifications, providing valuable insights into the influence of these features on classification outcomes.

The TESS-Keck Survey XXIV: Outer Giants may be More Prevalent in the Presence of Inner Small Planets,"We present the results of the Distant Giants Survey, a three-year radial velocity (RV) campaign to search for wide-separation giant planets orbiting Sun-like stars known to host an inner transiting planet. We defined a distant giant to have $a$ = 1--10 AU and $M_{p} \sin i = 70-4000$ \mearth~ = 0.2-12.5 \mj, and required transiting planets to have $a<1$ AU and $R_{p} = 1-4$ \rearth. We assembled our sample of 47 stars using a single selection function, and observed each star at monthly intervals to obtain $\approx$30 RV observations per target. The final catalog includes a total of twelve distant companions: four giant planets detected during our survey, two previously known giant planets, and six objects of uncertain disposition identified through RV/astrometric accelerations. Statistically, half of the uncertain objects are planets and the remainder are stars/brown dwarfs. We calculated target-by-target completeness maps to account for missed planets. We found evidence for a moderate enhancement of distant giants (DG) in the presence of close-in small planets (CS), P(DG|CS) = $30^{+14}_{-12}\%$, over the field rate of P(DG) = $16^{+2}_{-2}\%$. No enhancement is disfavored ($p \sim$ 8%). In contrast to a previous study, we found no evidence that stellar metallicity enhances P(DG|CS). We found evidence that distant giant companions are preferentially found in systems with multiple transiting planets and have lower eccentricities than randomly selected giant planets. This points toward dynamically cool formation pathways for the giants that do not disturb the inner systems.","['Judah Van Zandt', 'Erik A. Petigura', 'Jack Lubin', 'Lauren M. Weiss', 'Emma V.

From Stability to Instability: Characterizing the Eccentricities of Multi-planet Systems in the California Kepler Survey as a Means of Studying Stability,"Understanding the stability of exoplanet systems is crucial for constraining planetary formation and evolution theories. We use the machine-learning stability indicator, SPOCK, to characterize the stability of 126 high-multiplicity systems from the California Kepler Survey (CKS). We constrain the range of stable eccentricities for each system, adopting the value associated with a 50% chance of stability as the characteristic eccentricity. We confirm characteristic eccentricities via a small suite of N-body integrations. In studying correlations between characteristic eccentricity and various planet-pair and system-level metrics we find that minimum period ratio correlates most strongly with characteristic eccentricity. These characteristic eccentricities are approximately 20% of the eccentricities necessary for two-body mean-motion resonance overlap, suggesting three-body dynamics are needed to drive future instabilities. Systems in which the eccentricities would need to be high (> 0.15) to drive instability are likely dynamically relaxed and might be the fossils of a previous epoch of giant impacts that increased the typical planet-planet spacing.","['Matthew J.

Open-source Flux Transport (OFT). I. HipFT -- High-performance Flux Transport,"Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (this http URL). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.","['Ronald M.

A Predicted Great Dimming of T Tauri: Has it Begun?,"The optical star in the T Tauri triple system is the prototype of young sun-like stars in our galaxy. This complex and dynamic system has evidence for misaligned disks and outflows, and molecular material in a circumbinary ring that obscures the southern infrared binary, T Tau South. Observations by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) show that T Tau North, the optical star, has dimmed by up to ~2 magnitudes in the visual over the course of the past decade. The dimming across the B, V, R and I bands has a color character typical of changes in ISM extinction, suggesting an increase in obscuration along the line of sight to T Tau North. Material associated with the circumbinary ring around T Tau South has been predicted to occult the optical star via wide-scale orbital motion of the system. Through analysis of the geometrical configuration and motion of dust structures in the system, it seems that a great dimming of T Tau North by line-of-sight material associated with the T Tau South binary has, in fact, begun. Based on the extent and motion of the circumbinary ring material associated with the southern binary, T Tau North will likely experience dimming events for decades to come and may disappear entirely from the optical sky as the densest mid-plane region of the ring traverses our line of sight.",['Tracy L.

The heating efficiency of hot Jupiters from a data-driven perspective,"The inflated radii of hot Jupiters have been explored by various theoretical mechanisms. By connecting planetary thermal evolution models with the observed properties of hot Jupiters using hierarchical Bayesian models, a theoretical parameter called the heating efficiency has been introduced to describe the heating of the interiors of these planets. Previous studies have shown that the marginal distribution of this heating efficiency parameter has a single-peak distribution along the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq). Since the foundation of these Bayesian inference models are the observed properties of hot Jupiters, there must be a corresponding feature in the observed data that leads to the inferred single-peak distribution of the heating efficiency. This study aims to find the underlying cause of the single-peak heating efficiency distribution without relying on specific theoretical models. By analyzing the relationship between different observed physical properties, we obtained a similar single-peak distribution of the radius expansion efficiency of hot Jupiters along Teq, which can be explained by the correlation with the stellar effective temperature. However, a detailed investigation suggests that this single-peak distribution is actually the result of straightforward physical processes. Specifically, the increase in heating efficiency can be attributed to the increase in incident stellar flux, while the decrease in heating efficiency can be attributed to the rise in gravitational binding energy associated with the increase in planetary mass.","['Sheng Jin', 'Dong-Hong Wu', 'Yi-Xuan Cao', 'Zi-Yi Guo']",7.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06395,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Planet-star interactions – Planets and satellites: gaseous planets – Methods: data analysis – Methods: statistical 1'],2025-01-14
Multi-episodes of remote brightenings driven by a coronal EUV jet on the Sun,"Remote brightening (RB) is compact brightening at footpoints of magnetic loops, which are remotely-connecting to and confining an eruption in the solar atmosphere. Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet with a speed of about 90\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The loops connecting the RB and the jet have an apparent length of about 59\,Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least two episodes of brightenings, as characterised by two peaks in its lightcurve. The energies, which sustain the first and second peaks of the RB, are $6.3\times10^{26}$\,erg and $8.4\times10^{26}$\,erg, respectively, and take a significant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB brightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 seconds, while the second peak lags behind by 108 seconds. Besides the flows of the ejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption site. One is relatively cool with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=5.8-6.1$ and has a speed of about $275\pm15$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The other is hot with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=7.0-7.3$ and travels much faster with a speed of about 750$\pm$\,70\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We attribute the second peak of RB directly to this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a slow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of RB and the eruption, we infer this first episode is due to heating by nonthermal electrons. Our research demonstrates that the dynamics in an RB can offer vital insights into the nature of the corresponding eruption and help understand how the energy is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere.","['Chao Zhang', 'Zhenghua Huang', 'Hengyuan Wei', 'Youqian Qi', 'Mijie Shi', 'Hui Fu', 'Xiuhui Zuo', 'Weixin Liu', 'Mingzhe Sun', 'Ming Xiong', 'Lidong Xia']",4.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06403,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Plasma jets (1263)'],2025-01-14
Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in \textsc{Hi}-Rich Galaxies,"We analyze rotation curves of five \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.","['Demao Kong', 'Hai-Bo Yu']",5.0,8.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06413,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],Physics of the Dark Universe,,[': Galaxies Dark matter Galaxy dark matter halosABSTRACT WeanalyzerotationcurvesoffiveH I-richgalaxiesrecentlydiscoveredwithMeerKAT'],2025-01-14
Optimization of x-ray event screening using ground and in-orbit data for the Resolve instrument onboard the XRISM satellite,"The XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) satellite was successfully launched and put into a low-Earth orbit on September 6, 2023 (UT). The Resolve instrument onboard XRISM hosts an x-ray microcalorimeter detector, which was designed to achieve a high-resolution ($\leq$7 eV FWHM at 6 keV), high-throughput, and non-dispersive spectroscopy over a wide energy range. It also excels in a low background with a requirement of $< 2 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ (0.3--12.0 keV), which is equivalent to only one background event per spectral bin per 100 ks exposure. Event screening to discriminate x-ray events from background is a key to meeting the requirement. We present the result of the Resolve event screening using data sets recorded on the ground and in orbit based on the heritage of the preceding x-ray microcalorimeter missions, in particular, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard ASTRO-H. We optimize and evaluate 19 screening items of three types based on (1) the event pulse shape, (2) relative arrival times among multiple events, and (3) good time intervals. We show that the initial screening, which is applied for science data products in the performance verification phase, reduces the background rate to $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ meeting the requirement. We further evaluate the additional screening utilizing the correlation among some pulse shape properties of x-ray events and show that it further reduces the background rate particularly in the $<$2 keV band. Over 0.3--12 keV, the background rate becomes $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$.","['Yuto Mochizuki', 'Masahiro Tsujimoto', 'Caroline A. Kilbourne', 'Megan E.

Comparison of Equations of State for Neutron Stars with First-Order Phase Transitions: A Qualitative Study,"The equation of state is fundamental in describing matter under the extreme conditions characteristic of neutron stars and is central to advancing our understanding of dense matter physics. A critical challenge, however, lies in accurately modelling first-order phase transitions while ensuring thermodynamic consistency and aligning with astrophysical observations. This study explores two frameworks for constructing EoSs with first-order phase transitions: the polytropic interpolation method and the randomized speed-of-sound interpolation approach. It is found that the mass-radius relation and pressure vs. energy density relation are blind towards the thermodynamic consistency check. The polytropic interpolation method can exhibit discontinuities in the chemical potential for first-order phase transition, raising concerns regarding potential causality violations and thermodynamic inconsistencies. In contrast, the speed of sound interpolation approach ensures continuity in the chemical potential, offering a more thermodynamically consistent and reliable framework. Moreover, the sound speed method effectively captures the softer segment of the mass-radius spectrum, a capability not achieved by the consistent piecewise-polytropic approach due to its monotonic stiffness constraints. The speed of sound definition involving number density and chemical potential reveals the thermodynamic inconsistency, making it a more consistent and robust definition. These findings underscore the importance of thermodynamic consistency in EoS construction and highlight the advantages of the randomized speed-of-sound method for modelling phase transitions in dense matter.","['Anshuman Verma', 'Asim Kumar Saha', 'Ritam Mallick']",5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06453,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-14
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an Extraterrestrial Atmospheric Technosignature,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are prevalent in the universe and interstellar medium but are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources on Earth, such as fossil fuel combustion and firewood burning. Drawing upon the idea of PAHs as suitable candidates for technosignatures, we investigate the detectability of those PAHs that have available absorption cross-sections in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets (orbiting G-type stars at a distance of 10 parsecs) with an 8m mirror of Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Specifically, we focus on Naphthalene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, and Pyrene. Our simulations indicate that under current Earth-like conditions, detecting PAH signatures between 0.2-0.515 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ is infeasible. To account for the historical decline in PAH production post-industrial revolution, we explore varying PAH concentrations to assess instrumental capabilities to detect civilizations resembling modern Earth. We also evaluate telescope architectures (6m, 8m, and 10m mirror diameters) to put our results into the context of the future HWO mission. With these four molecules, PAH detection remains infeasible, even at concentrations ten times higher than current levels. While larger mirrors provide some advantages, they fail to resolve the spectral signatures of these molecules with significant signal-to-noise ratios. The UV absorption features of PAHs, caused by $\mathrm{\pi}$-orbital $\rightarrow$ $\mathrm{\pi^*}$-orbital electronic transitions, serve as valuable markers due to their distinct and detectable nature, preserved by the aromatic stability of PAHs. Additional lab measurements are necessary to gather absorption cross-section data beyond UV for more abundant PAHs. This may help further in improving the detectability of these molecules.","['Dwaipayan Dubey', 'Ravi Kopparapu', 'Barbara Ercolano', 'Karan Molaverdikhani']",5.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06462,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Exoplanet atmospheres (487)'],2025-01-14
Study Self-lensing/Eclipsing Signals in Edge-on Double White-Dwarf Systems,"Stellar lightcurves from edge-on double white dwarf systems(DWDs) have periodic lensing/eclipsing signals at times of alignment between two components as seen by the observer. Here, we study the characterization and detection of these signals. In common DWDs, the Einstein radii have similar orders of magnitude with WDs' radii, and the projected source and lens radii normalized to the Einstein radius ($\rho_{\star}$, and $\rho_{\rm l}$) are $\sim 1$. Both of them are reduced with the orbital period and the lens mass. If $\rho_{\rm l}\simeq 1$ the lensing-induced minor image is always blocked by the lens which results lower magnification factors. If $\rho_{\rm l}\lesssim 1$ and in transit events the finite-lens effects decrease the lightcurves' width. When $\rho_{\rm l}\gtrsim1$ (happens for close DWDs including one low-mass and one massive WD) deep or complete eclipses dominate to lensing effects. The self-lensing signals maximize for massive DWDs in wide orbits. We study the detect-ability of lensing/eclipsing signals in edge-on DWDs in observations by The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS), The Vera Rubin Observatory(LSST) and The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We simulate stellar lightcurves due to edge-on DWDs and generate synthetic data points based on their observing strategies. Detection efficiency maximizes for extremely low-mass WDs in close orbits, and the numbers of DWDs within 100 pc and an observing cone with detectable lensing/eclipsing signals in one $27.4$-day TESS and $62$-day Roman observing window are $\sim1$ and $<1$, respectively.

New look at old friends: EVN imaging of prominent radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical positional offsets,"When comparing modern fundamental reference frames in the radio (International Celestial Reference Frame) and optical (Gaia), a couple of bright radio reference sources appear to have very large radio-optical offsets, from tens up to hundreds of milliarcseconds (mas). The amount of these positional misalignments exceeds the uncertainty of each individual technique by at least an order of magnitude. In most cases, complex and extended radio structure and its time variability, and thus the difficulty in pinpointing the true location of the central engine, is responsible for the large apparent offsets. Sometimes distant parts of the radio structure are not properly detected due to a lack of shorter interferometer baselines. For our 5-GHz very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment using antennas of the European VLBI Network and the enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network, we selected 10 bright radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical offsets. Sensitive imaging involving a wide range of projected baseline lengths, as well as phase-referencing to nearby sources shed light on the possible causes of positional inconsistencies. Here we show results for 3 selected sources from this project.","['S. Frey', 'O. Titov', 'A. Melnikov', 'S. Lambert']",3.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06513,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs),"Accurate and reliable photometric redshifts determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are determined. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). Proposed CGAN implementation, approaches photometric redshift determination as a probabilistic regression, where instead of determining a single value for the estimated redshift of the galaxy, a full probability density is computed.

FOGGIE X: Characterizing the Small-Scale Structure of the CGM and its Imprint on Observables,"One of the main unknowns in galaxy evolution is how gas flows into and out of galaxies in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studies observing the CGM in absorption using multiple or extended background objects suggest a high degree of variation on relatively small ($\lesssim 1$ kpc) spatial scales. Similarly, high-resolution simulations generally exhibit small-scale substructure in the gas around galaxies. We examine the small-scale structure of the $z = 1$ CGM using simulations from the FOGGIE (Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo) project. We select gaseous substructures (""clumps"") by their local overdensity and investigate their physical properties, including temperature, metallicity, and kinematics with respect to the galaxy and the nearby surroundings. FOGGIE resolves clumps down to sphericalized radii $R \sim 0.25$ kpc at $z = 1$. The distribution of clumps peaks at $\sim 10^5$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{4}$ K, consistent with relatively condensed, cool gas with a slight preference for inflow-like velocities. Many clumps show internal temperature and density variations, and thus internally varying ionization levels for key diagnostic ions such as HI, MgII, and OVI. The average metallicity in clumps is about a factor 1.5--2$\times$ lower in metallicity than nearby gas, suggesting that the metals are not well-mixed between structured and diffuse CGM, which may have implications for observational metallicity estimations of dense CGM clouds. We estimate the survivability of CGM clumps and find that structures larger than 0.5 kpc are generally long-lived. Finally, we qualitatively compare the simulated cloud properties to Milky Way high-velocity clouds.","['Ramona Augustin', 'Jason Tumlinson', 'Molly S. Peeples', ""Brian W. O'Shea"", 'Britton D.

Mission Analysis for the First-Ever Saturn Trojan 2019 UO$_{14}$,"In mid-2024, asteroid 2019 UO$_{14}$ was identified as the first-ever Saturn Trojan through ground-based archival observations and numerical simulations. Trojans, including those associated with Jupiter and other planets, raise important questions about the formation processes of our solar system. Exploring this Trojan object with spacecraft may provide direct answers and definitive evidence regarding these questions. This paper thoroughly investigates potential mission scenarios to the first Saturn Trojan, 2019 UO$_{14}$, to determine the necessary launch window and spacecraft specifications. First, by assuming a ballistic flight using chemical engines, optimal sequences of events, including (powered) gravity-assist maneuvers and deep-space maneuvers, are identified through a meta-heuristic global trajectory optimization algorithm. The analysis indicates that flyby exploration is feasible with a launch window around 2034 and a $\Delta V$ ranging from 92 m/s to 1041 m/s within an 11-year mission duration, while a rendezvous can be achieved with a departure around 2035 and a $\Delta V$ of 2-3 km/s. Specifically, the itinerary via Saturn requires a $\Delta V$ of 2 km/s and a flight time of 24.6 years, while the route via Jupiter results in a $\Delta V$ of 3 km/s and a flight time of 13.4 years. Given that the orbital motion of outer solar system objects is relatively slow, low-thrust propulsion, which gradually accelerates the spacecraft, proves to be effective. Consequently, low-thrust trajectories to 2019 UO$_{14}$ were examined. The results demonstrate that a rendezvous can be accomplished with nearly the same departure epoch, time of flight, and $\Delta V$ as in the ballistic flight, suggesting that low-thrust propulsion is highly compatible with the rendezvous scenario, as it significantly reduces the propellant mass fraction.",['Yuki Takao'],14.0,21.0,13.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06586,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,Asteroids ·Trojans ·Saturn ·Exploration ·Trajectory ·Optimization ,2025-01-14
Barrow Interacting holographic dark energy cosmology with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff: A model can Alleviating the Hubble and $S_{8}$ Tension,"In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) and matter clustering (\(S_8\)) tensions within the framework of non-interacting and interacting Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) models. Utilizing a combination of observational datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and lensing data, we assess the degree of tension relative to the Planck 2018 results and recent measurements such as the Riess et al. 2022 (R22) value for \(H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}\) in 68\% C.L and KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 for \(S_8\). Our findings show that both BHDE models mitigate the \(H_0\) and \(S_8\) tensions compared to the standard \(\Lambda\) Cold Dark Matter (\(\Lambda\)CDM) model. The non-interacting BHDE model achieves a moderate reduction in the \(H_0\) tension, while the interacting BHDE model offers a better fit for both parameters, suggesting it is more effective in addressing the tensions. Additionally, the quantum-gravitational deformation parameter \(\Delta\), constrained using the CMB+All dataset, indicates significant quantum effects in both models. The interacting scenario provides tighter constraints on \(\Delta\) and total neutrino mass \(\sum m_{\nu}\), offering a more precise representation of these effects.

Long-lived Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs undergoing Neon-22 Distillation,"White dwarf stars have attracted considerable attention in the past 15 years as hosts for potentially habitable planets, but their low luminosity and continuous cooling are major challenges for habitability. Recently, astronomers have found that about 6% of massive white dwarfs seem to have ""paused"" their cooling for up to ~10 Gyr. The leading explanation for this cooling delay is the distillation of neutron-rich isotopes such as $^{22}$Ne in the white dwarf's interior, which releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy as the star's internal structure rearranges. Here, we consider the impact of $^{22}$Ne distillation on the evolution of white dwarf habitable zones. We find that $^{22}$Ne distillation in the white dwarf host dramatically increases the time that a planet can continuously reside within the habitable zone (giving more time for life to arise) and that long-lasting habitable zones are located farther from the star (decreasing the impact of tidal forces). These properties may make white dwarfs undergoing $^{22}$Ne distillation more promising locations for habitability than white dwarfs undergoing standard cooling.","['Andrew Vanderburg', 'Antoine Bédard', 'Juliette C.

Determining the nature of IC 10 X-2: A comprehensive study of the Optical/Infrared emission from an extragalactic BeHMXB,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a super-giant HMXB and super-fast X-ray transient (SFXT) by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Factory and Las Cumbres Observatory over a ~5 year period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a $\sim26.5$~d period -- likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the Hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the neutron star. Lastly, the numerous, short duration, episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly ``redder'' or ``bluer'' than normal likely result from from clumps within this system -- which can accrete onto the neutron star (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer), or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respect to those thought to be common in the early Universe.","['Jwaher Alnaqbi', 'Joseph D.

"Comparing the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ SN cosmology analyses: Investigation based on ""Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae systematics?""","Recent cosmological analyses measuring distances of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) have all given similar hints at time-evolving dark energy. To examine whether underestimated SN Ia systematics might be driving these results, Efstathiou (2024) compared overlapping SN events between Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR (20% SNe are in common), and reported evidence for a $\sim$0.04 mag offset between the low and high-redshift distance measurements of this subsample of events. If these offsets are arbitrarily subtracted from the entire DES-SN5YR sample, the preference for evolving dark energy is reduced. In this paper, we reproduce this offset and show that it has two sources. First, 43% of the offset is due to DES-SN5YR improvements in the modelling of supernova intrinsic scatter and host galaxy properties. These are scientifically-motivated modelling updates implemented in DES-SN5YR and their associated uncertainties are captured within the DES-SN5YR systematic error budget. Even if the less accurate scatter model and host properties from Pantheon+ are used instead, the DES-SN5YR evidence for evolving dark energy is only reduced from 3.9$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. Second, 38% of the offset is due to a misleading comparison because different selection functions characterize the DES subsets included in Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR and therefore individual SN distance measurements are expected to be different because of different bias corrections. In conclusion, we confirm the validity of the published DES-SN5YR results.","['M. Vincenzi', 'R. Kessler', 'P. Shah', 'J. Lee', 'T. M. Davis', 'D. Scolnic', 'P. Armstrong', 'D. Brout', 'R.

Origin likelihood functions for extreme-energy cosmic rays,"Unlike neutrinos and photons arriving from extra-galactic sources, ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) do not trace back to their origins due to propagation effects such as magnetic deflections and energy losses. For ankle energies, UHECRs can propagate for hundreds of megaparsecs with negligible energy losses but the directional information is lost after a few megaparsecs. On the other hand, at the highest energies the directions are kept for larger distances due to the increased rigidity but the interaction rates with the cosmic microwave background strongly suppress the cosmic rays within a few to tens of megaparsecs. Therefore, UHECRs with energies $E > 10^{20}$ eV (extreme-energy cosmic rays (ExECRs)) such as the Amaterasu event recently reported by Telescope Array, are of particular interest to identify the sources within our galactic neighborhood. However, photonuclear interactions are stochastic in nature and produce changes in the nuclear species emitted, which makes it difficult the task of estimating the likelihood distribution of its origin. This work discusses a novel procedure to estimate the likelihood of the origin for extreme-energy cosmic rays based on probability distributions for UHECR stochastic interactions. The method is applied to the Amaterasu event and compared to recently published works which employ Monte Carlo codes (e.g. CRPropa) in their analysis. The advantages of the method presented here are demonstrated by the increased resolution and the ease of computation unlike other approaches employed so far. The results presented indicate that the localization of the origin of extreme energy cosmic rays could be possible in some cases without knowledge of the original composition.",['Leonel Morejon'],5.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06677,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,proceedings of the ECRS 2024,,[],2025-01-14
Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers,"The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.","['Sharan Banagiri', 'Thomas A.

BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code,"BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD ""Rome"" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.","['Yifu An', 'Yuxi Chen', 'Hongyang Zhou', 'Alexander Gaenko', 'Gábor Tóth']",5.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06717,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'Computational Physics', 'Space Physics']",the Astrophysical Journal,,[],2025-01-14
Tracking Outflow using Line-Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-Locking Web identified in Quasar J151352+085555,"Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line-locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming 'line-locking web'. In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present discovery of one of the largest 'line-locking web' known to date from the VLT/UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C IV, N V, Si IV, O VI, and multiple Lyman lines (Ly${\alpha}$ to Ly${\epsilon}$), and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests the absorbers likely have sub-solar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states comparing to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows, and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.","['Chen Chen', 'Zhicheng He', 'Weimin Yi', 'Tuo Ji', 'Marie Wingyee Lau', 'Bo Ma']",12.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06734,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Impact of Coulomb Correction Factor on Rate of Change of Lepton Fraction during Presupernova Evolution,"We reexamine the weak interaction nuclei having largest contribution to the lepton to baryon fraction Ye by coupling the stellar weak rates and mass abundances for post silicon burning conditions during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The stellar weak rates were recently calculated by Nabi et al. 2021 employing the fully microscopic pnQRPA model without invoking the Brink Axel hypothesis. We compute the mass abundances for a total of 728 nuclei, with A equal 1to 100, using Sahas equation and assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium with the incorporation of Coulomb correction factor to the chemical potential. We compile a list of top 50 electron capture ec and \b{eta} decay bd nuclei on the basis of largest contribution to Ye forpost silicon burning conditions where 11 percent ec and 6percent bd nuclei debuted dueto Coulomb corrections. The calculated mass abundances and corresponding Ye values are enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude for heavier nuclei once Coulomb corrections were incorporated. This enhancement led to anincrement in total Y bde and Yece values, at Ye equal to 0.425 (\r{ho} equal 2.20 multiply 109 g/cm3 of 80percent and 91percent respectively. After incorporating the Coulomb corrections we propose a revised interval of Ye equal 0.423 0.455 where bd rates surpass thecompeting ec rates and is 3.2 percent bigger than the one suggested by Nabi et al.

Optical appearance of the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk,"In this study, we analyze the observational images of a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, wherein a thin accretion disk, serving as the sole background light source, is situated on the equatorial plane of the black hole. The inner boundary of the thin accretion disk extends to the event horizon, and the accretion material in the disk exhibits two different motion behaviors, that is, it moves along the critical plunging orbit inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and follows the Keplerian orbit outside the ISCO. The shadow image is captured on the imaging plane of a zero angular momentum observer utilizing advanced fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques. The results demonstrate that an image consistently reveals a dark region encircled by a narrow photon ring, which is called the inner shadow. At low observation inclination angles, the observation intensity is highly concentrated, with the lensed image of accretion disk being superimposed on the direct image. As observation inclination angle increases, the direct and lensed images gradually separate, becoming distinctly distinguishable and forming a hat-like structure. Furthermore, variations in the parameter space and observation angle will influence pertinent image characteristics, including image symmetry, the range or deformation degree of the inner shadow. We further examined the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Subsequently, we also examined the redshift distribution on the disk. The findings indicate that while variations in relevant parameters do influence the redshift distribution, the primary factor is the change in observational inclination. The observer can detect both redshift and blueshift phenomena on the screen when viewed at a higher observation angle.","['Ke-Jian He', 'Chen-Yu Yang', 'Xiao-Xiong Zeng']",13.0,32.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06778,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-14
"Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars","Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.","['Luca Boccioli', 'David Vartanyan', ""Evan P.

A comparative study of galaxy evolution with four different active galactic nucleus torus models and two different host geometries,"Estimating physical quantities such as the star formation rate, stellar mass and active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction of galaxies is a key step in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In order to estimate the uncertainties in the predicted values for these quantities, in this paper we explore the impact of adopting four different AGN torus models in fitting the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SED) of galaxies. We also explore the impact of adopting two different geometries for the host, a spheroidal geometry, more appropriate for late-stage mergers, and a disc geometry, more appropriate for galaxies forming stars with secular processes. We use optical to submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) and utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo SED-fitting code. We use exclusively radiative transfer models for the AGN torus as well as for the starburst and host galaxy. We concentrate on a sample of 200 galaxies at z~2, selected in the ELAIS-N1 field. All galaxies have a detection at 250um which ensures the presence of a starburst. We find that the stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies can be robustly estimated by the SED fitting but the AGN fraction depends very much on the adopted torus model. We also find that the vast majority of the galaxies in our sample are better fitted by a spheroidal geometry and lie above the main sequence. Our method predicts systematically higher SFR and lower stellar mass than the popular energy balance method CIGALE.","['Michail Papadopoulos', 'Vicky Papadopoulou Lesta', 'Ioannis Michos', 'Duncan Farrah', 'Andreas Efstathiou']",6.0,16.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06870,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,,['radiative transfer – galaxies: active – galaxies: interactions –quasars: general – infrared: galaxies – submillimetre: galaxies'],2025-01-14
Measurements of the Temperature and E-mode Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background from the Full 500-square-degree SPTpol Dataset,"Using the full four-year SPTpol 500 deg$^2$ dataset in both the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, we present measurements of the temperature and $E$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as well as the $E$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum ($EE$) and temperature-$E$-mode cross-power spectrum ($TE$) in the angular multipole range $50<\ell<8000$. We find the SPTpol dataset to be self-consistent, passing several internal consistency tests based on maps, frequency bands, bandpowers, and cosmological parameters. The full SPTpol dataset is well-fit by the $\Lambda CDM$ model, for which we find $H_0=70.48\pm2.16$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.271\pm0.026$, when using only the SPTpol data and a Planck-based prior on the optical depth to reionization. The $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are consistent across the 95 GHz-only, 150 GHz-only, $TE$-only, and $EE$-only data splits. Between the $\ell<1000$ and $\ell>1000$ data splits, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are borderline consistent at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. This consistency improves when including a parameter $A_L$, the degree of lensing of the CMB inferred from the smearing of acoustic peaks. When marginalized over $A_L$, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints from SPTpol are consistent with those from Planck. The power spectra presented here are the most sensitive measurements of the lensed CMB damping tail to date for roughly $\ell > 1700$ in $TE$ and $\ell > 2000$ in $EE$.","['T.-L. Chou', 'P. A. R.

Oscillations of Solitonic Galactic Cores in Ultralight Dark Matter,"A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.","['L.

Solar Particle Acceleration,"High-energy particles may be accelerated widely in stellar coronae; probably by the same processes we find in the Sun. Here, we have learned of two physical mechanisms that dominate the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs). The highest energies and intensities are produced in ""gradual"" events at shock waves driven from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Smaller, but more numerous, ""impulsive"" events with unusual particle composition are produced during magnetic reconnection in solar jets and flares. Jets provide open magnetic field lines where SEPs escape; closed magnetic loops contain this energy to produce bright, hot flares, perhaps even contributing to heating the low corona in profuse nanoflares. Streaming protons amplify Alfven waves upstream of the shocks. These waves scatter and trap SEPs and, in large events, modify the element abundances and flatten the low-energy spectra upstream. Shocks also reaccelerate residual ions from earlier impulsive events, when available, that characteristically dominate the energetic heavy-ion abundances. The large CME-driven shock waves develop an extremely wide longitude span, filling much of the inner heliosphere with energetic particles.",['Donald V.

Impact of Weak Lensing Mass Mapping Algorithms on Cosmology Inference,"Weak lensing mass mapping algorithms, which reconstruct the convergence field from galaxy shear measurements, are crucial for extracting higher-order statistics to constrain cosmological parameters. However, only limited research has explored whether the choice of mass mapping algorithm affects the inference of cosmological parameters from weak lensing higher-order statistics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different mass mapping algorithms on the inference of cosmological parameters measured with weak lensing peak counts. We employ Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass mapping algorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak lensing data. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as data vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that the choice of mass mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on cosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to 157$\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises from MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast, inpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires, indicating limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter estimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass mapping algorithms is thus critical for cosmological inference from weak lensing data. Advanced algorithms like MCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can substantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate mass mapping techniques in weak lensing studies to fully exploit the potential of higher-order statistics for cosmological research.","['Andreas Tersenov', 'Lucie Baumont', 'Jean-Luc Starck', 'Martin Kilbinger']",9.0,14.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06961,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['statistical – gravitational lensing: weak – cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe 1'],2025-01-14
AAS2RTO: Automated Alert Streams to Real-Time Observations: Preparing for rapid follow-up of transient objects in the era of LSST,"The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover tens of thousands of astrophysical transients per night, far outpacing available spectroscopic follow-up capabilities. Carefully prioritising candidates for follow-up observations will maximise the scientific return from small telescopes with a single-object spectrograph. We introduce AAS2RTO, an astrophysical transient candidate prioritisation tool written in Python. AAS2RTO is flexible in that any number of criteria that consider observed properties of transients can be implemented. The visibility of candidates from a given observing site is also considered. The prioritised list of candidates provided by AAS2RTO is continually updated when new transient data are made available. Therefore, it can be applied to observing campaigns with a wide variety of scientific motivations. AAS2RTO uses a greedy algorithm to prioritise candidates. Candidates are represented by a single numerical value, or `score'. Scores are computed by constructing simple numerical factors which individually consider the competing facets of a candidate which make it suitable for follow-up observation. AAS2RTO is currently configured to work primarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), distributed by certified LSST community brokers. We provide an example of how AAS2RTO can be used by defining a set of criteria to prioritise observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) close to peak brightness, in preparation for observations with the spectrograph at the Danish-1.54m telescope. Using a sample of archival alerts from ZTF, we evaluate the criteria we have designed to estimate the number of SNe Ia that we will be able to observe with a 1.5m telescope. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our criteria when applied to mock LSST observations of SNe Ia.","['Aidan Sedgewick', 'Christa Gall', 'Luca Izzo', 'Adriano Agnello', 'Charlotte R.

Stellar Population and Metal Production in AGN Disks,"As gravitational wave detections increase the number of observed compact binaries (consisting of neutron stars or blacks), we begin to probe the different conditions producing these binaries. Most studies of compact remnant formation focus either on stellar collapse from the evolution of field binary stars in gas-free environments or the formation of stars in clusters where dynamical interactions capture the compact objects, forming binaries. But a third scenario exists. In this paper, we study the fate of massive stars formed, accrete gas, and evolve in the dense disks surrounding supermassive black holes. We calculate the explosions produced and compact objects formed by the collapse of these massive stars. Nucleosynthetic yields may provide an ideal, directly observable, diagnostic of the formation and fate of these stars in active galactic nuclei. We present a first study of the explosive yields from these stars, comparing these yields with the observed nucleosynthetic signatures in the disks around supermassive stars with quasars. We show that, even though these stars tend to form black holes, their rapid rotation leads to disks that can eject a considerable amount of iron during the collapse of the star. The nucleosynthetic yields from these stars can produce constraints on the number of systems formed in this manner, but further work is needed to exploit variations from the initial models presented in this paper.","['Chris L.

A Spectroscopic and Interferometric Study of W Serpentis Stars. I. Circumbinary Outflow in the Interacting Binary W Serpentis,"W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid class of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense mass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both stars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here we present an observational analysis of high quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope and ARCES spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline interferometric observations obtained with the CHARA Array. We present examples of the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components: prominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption lines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with the cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the donor star. The donor's absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we derive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 +/- 0.09 based on the assumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously with the orbit. We use a fit of the ASAS light curve to determine the orbital inclination and mass estimates of 2.0 and 5.7 solar masses for the donor and gainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of orbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the distance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is enshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an outflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.","['Katherine Shepard', 'Douglas R.

State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background,"The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy.

Dark matter halo dynamics in 2D Vlasov Simulations: a self-similar approach,"Understanding dark matter halo dynamics can be pivotal in unravelling the nature of dark matter particles. Analytical treatment of the multistream flows inside the turnaround region of a collapsed cold dark matter (CDM) halo using various self-similar approaches already exist. In this work, we aim to determine the extent of self-similarity in 2D halo dynamics and the factors leading to deviations from it by studying numerical simulations of monolithically growing CDM halos. We have adapted the Fillmore and Goldreich (FG) self-similar solutions assuming cylindrical symmetry to data from 2D Vlasov-Poisson (ColDICE package) simulations of CDM halos seeded by sine wave initial conditions. We measured trajectories in position and phase-space, mass and density profiles and compared these to predictions from the FG model. We find that after turn-around and subsequent shell crossing, particles undergo a period of relaxation, typically about 1-2 oscillations about the center before they start to trace the self-similar fits and continue to do so as long as their orbits are predominantly radial. Overplotting the trajectories from different snapshots in scale-free position-time and phase spaces shows strikingly good superposition, a defining feature of self-similarity. The radial density profiles measured from simulations: $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}, \alpha = 0.9 - 1.0$ are consistent with FG's prediction $\alpha=1$ for 2D halos. Deviations from the model, on the other hand, are evidently linked to relaxation, inhibited motion due to periodic boundaries, transverse motion in the halo interior, and deficit of infalling mass in limited simulation volume. It could not be conclusively established if the halos tend to grow circular over time. Extension of this work to actual 3D CDM cosmologies necessitates further detailed study of self-similar solutions with ellipsoidal collapse and transverse motion.","['Abineet Parichha', 'Stephane Colombi', 'Shohei Saga', 'Atsushi Taruya']",13.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07001,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Dark Matter halo dynamics– Vlasov-Poisson simulations – Self-similarity 1'],2025-01-14
Verifying the Australian MWA EoR pipeline II: fundamental limits of the AusEoRPipe and the impact of instrumental effects,"Detection of the weak cosmological signal from high-redshift hydrogen demands careful data analysis and an understanding of the full instrument signal chain. Here we use the WODEN simulation pipeline to produce realistic data from the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionisation experiment, and test the effects of different instrumental systematics through the AusEoRPipe analysis pipeline. The simulations include a realistic full sky model, direction-independent calibration, and both random and systematic instrumental effects. Results are compared to matched real observations. We find that, (i) with a sky-based calibration and power spectrum approach we have need to subtract more than 90% of all unresolved point source flux (10mJy apparent) to recover 21-cm signal in the absence of instrumental effects; (ii) when including diffuse emission in simulations, some k-modes cannot be accessed, leading to a need for some diffuse emission removal; (iii) the single greatest cause of leakage is an incomplete sky model; (iv) other sources of errors, such as cable reflections, flagged channels and gain errors, impart comparable systematic power to one another, and less power than the incomplete skymodel.","['J.

The timing and spectral properties of the 2022 outburst of SGR J1935+2154 observed with NICER,"The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a new active episode on October 10, 2022, with X-ray bursts and enhanced persistent emission. At the tail of high burst rate interval, lasting several hours, radio bursts were detected, revealing the connection between the X-ray activities and radio emissions. We analyzed observations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly three months, using data from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We report the timing and spectral results following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the persistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light curve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of this flare. We found a phase jump of pulse profile, with a deviation of $0.16\pm0.03$ phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit with the combination of a blackbody and a power law model. The decay of the outburst is dominated by the drop of the non-thermal component, which also leads to the increase of thermal proportion.

Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties,"We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.","['Ankit Kumar', 'Hajime Sotani']",12.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07052,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Theory', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,[],2025-01-14
Exploring mass transfer mechanisms in symbiotic systems,"We define two regimes of the parameter space of symbiotic systems based on the dominant mass transfer mechanism. A wide range of white dwarf (WD) mass, donor mass, and donor radius combinations are explored to determine the separation, for each parameter combination, below which wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) will be the dominant mass transfer mechanism. The underlying concept is the premise that the wind accelerates. If it reaches the Roche-lobe before attaining sufficient velocity to escape, it will be trapped, and gravitationally focused through the inner Lagrangian point towards the accreting WD. However, if the wind succeeds in attaining the required velocity to escape from the donor's Roche-lobe, it will disperse isotropically, and the dominant mass transfer mechanism will be the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescription in which only a fraction of the wind will be accreted onto the WD. We present, these two regimes of the four dimensional parameter space, covering 375 different parameter combinations.","['Irin Babu Vathachira', 'Yael Hillman', 'Amit Kashi']",4.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07067,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],ApJ,,"['novae—stars: AGB and post-AGB 1', 'accretion', 'accretion disks— binaries: close — binaries: symbiotic— cataclysmic variables']",2025-01-14
Neutrino-dominated relativistic viscous accretion flows around rotating black holes with shocks,"We investigate the relativistic, viscous, advective, neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar mass black holes, incorporating neutrino cooling. By adopting an effective potential to describe the spacetime geometry around the rotating black holes, we self-consistently solve the governing NDAF equations to obtain global transonic accretion solutions. Our findings indicate that, depending on the model parameters, namely energy ($\varepsilon$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}$), viscosity ($\alpha$) and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$), NDAFs may harbor standing shocks where the Rankine-Hugoniot shock conditions (RHCs) are satisfied. Utilizing these shock-induced NDAF solutions, we compute the neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$) across a wide range of model parameters. We further calculate maximum neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}^{\rm max}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max}$) resulting in $L_{\nu}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{51-53}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{48-51}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and $L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{48-52}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{42-49}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for $a_{\rm k}=0.99$ (0.0). These findings suggest that shocked NDAF solutions are potentially promising to explain the energy output of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We employ our NDAF model formalism to elucidate $L^{\rm obs}_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$ for five GRBs with known redshifts and estimate their accretion rate (${\dot m}$) based on the spin ($a_{\rm k}$) of the central source of GRBs under consideration.","['Amit Kumar', 'Sayan Chakrabarti', 'Santabrata Das']",7.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07080,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Accretion (14)'],2025-01-14
A Deep Search for a Strong Diffuse Interstellar Band in the Circumgalactic Medium,"We investigate the absorption signals of a strong diffuse interstellar band, DIB$\lambda4430$, in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) traced by MgII absorption lines. To this end, we make use of approximately 60,000 MgII absorption line spectra within $0.4<z<1.0$ compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys and obtain composite spectra with uncertainties for absorption line measurements being a few m$Å$. By using MgII absorption strength and dust reddening relation from the literature, we measure the DIB$\lambda4430$ absorption strength as a function of $\rm E(B-V)$ in the CGM, and compare the Milky Way DIB$\lambda4430$ - $\rm E(B-V)$ relation extrapolated down to the CGM $\rm E(B-V)$ region. Our results show no detectable signals of DIB$\lambda4430$ across the entire $\rm E(B-V)$ range in the CGM traced by MgII absorption lines. This lack of detection of DIB$\lambda4430$ in the CGM is inconsistent with the Milky Way signals by $\sim 5 \, \sigma$, indicating that the factors associated with different environments affect the abundance of the DIB$\lambda4430$ carrier.","['Chih-Yuan Chang', 'Ting-Wen Lan']",2.0,7.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07082,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['Diffuse interstellar bands (379)', 'and Intergalactic dust clouds (810) 1', 'Circumgalactic medium (1879)']",2025-01-14
On the origin of compressive turbulence in protoclumps in high redshift disks,"The giant, star forming clumps in gas-rich, high redshift disks are commonly assumed to form due to gravitational instabilities, in which protoclumps have a Toomre-$Q$ parameter less than unity. However, some cosmological simulations show that clumps can form in regions where $Q\gg1$. In these simulations, there is an excess of compressive modes of turbulence that lead to gravitational collapse of regions that were not supposed to gravitationally collapse, according to linear theory. In contrast, sites of clump formation in isolated simulations do not show this excess, hinting that the origin may be external. We explore two external mechanisms that can induce compressive modes of disk turbulence in protoclumps, namely, compressive tides exerted by the cosmological environment and the direct driving by inflowing streams. We correlate the local strength of compressive tides and the amount of fresh stream material with protoclump regions in zoom-in cosmological simulations. The local strength of compressive tides is derived from the tidal tensor. The local strength of incoming streams is derived from the fractional presence of the stream compared to the average. We find that the tidal field in protoclumps tends to be over-compressive while random patches in the disk show diverging tides. In particular, in $25\%$ of the protoclumps, the tidal field is fully compressive, while no random patch resides in regions of fully compressive tides. In addition, protoclumps tend to reside in regions where the fraction of incoming stream mass is 2-10 times larger than the average at the same galactocentric radius. Both compressive tides and inflowing streams are correlated with the protoclumps and can thus serve as the drivers of excessive compressive turbulence that can initiate clump formation. This constitutes a new, non-linear mode of violent disk instabilities in high-$z$ galaxies.","['Omry Ginzburg', 'Avishai Dekel', 'Nir Mandelker', 'Frederic Bournaud', 'Daniel Ceverino', 'Joel Primack']",13.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07097,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['ISM: Kinematics and dynamics – ISM: Structure – Galaxies: formation – Galaxies: high-redshift 1'],2025-01-14
Constraints on $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology using Cosmic Chronometers and Supernova data,"In this manuscript, we investigate the constraints on dynamical vacuum models within the framework of $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology by assuming a parameterization of the vacuum energy density as $\rho_{\Lambda}(t)=\rho_{\Lambda 0} \left[1 + \alpha (1 - a)\right]$, where $\rho_{\Lambda 0}$ is the present vacuum density and $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We use 31 cosmic chronometer data points and 1048 Pantheon type Ia supernova samples to constrain the model parameters. Our statistical analysis employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We have found that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion, transitioning from a decelerating phase. The transition redshift $z_t=0.65^{+0.03}_{-0.19}$ obtained from the combined CC+SNe dataset is consistent with recent constraints. The total EoS indicates an accelerating phase, with density parameters for matter and vacuum energy exhibiting expected behaviors. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows distinct behaviors for different datasets, and the present value of the jerk parameter deviates slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM model but remains consistent within uncertainties. These findings support the dynamic nature of dark energy and provide valuable constraints on the evolution of the universe.","['Yerlan Myrzakulov', 'M. Koussour', 'M. Bulanbay', 'S. Muminov', 'J.

Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.","['Lei Lei', 'Yi-Ying Wang', 'Guan-Wen Yuan', 'Tong-Lin Wang', 'Martin A.

Study of Migration of Giant Planets and Formation of Populations of Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Nice Model,"Numerical modeling of the interaction of giant planets and the planetesimal disk was carried out for the Nice model, in which the initial orbits of the planets are in resonant configurations. In addition to the standard Nice model, planetesimals in the planetary region were considered and the self-gravity of the planetesimal disk was taken into account. The dynamical evolution of planetary systems has been studied for time intervals on the order of the lifetime of the Solar System.

The diverse physical origins of stars in the dynamically hot bulge: CALIFA vs. IllustrisTNG,"We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.","['Le Zhang', 'Ling Zhu', 'Annalisa Pillepich', 'Min Du', 'Fangzhou Jiang', 'Jesús Falcón-Barroso']",15.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07151,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['methods: numerical – galaxies: kinematics – galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: star formation 1'],2025-01-14
"Observation and modeling of complex transient structure in heliosphere followed by geomagnetic storm on May 10-11, 2024","Complex CME/ICME structures in the solar wind often arising in the heliosphere as a result of interaction between two or more CMEs are very important due to their enhanced geoefficiency, but their modeling is difficult due to lack of observational data outside the solar corona. The outstanding evidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the strongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged from the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the series triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to consider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at three stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle heliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS observations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables to build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with enhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the heliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone base were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of 20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position corresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the modeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric distance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may characterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME interaction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1 position agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed expansion model.","['Denis Rodkin', 'Vladislav Lukmanov', 'Vladimir Slemzin', 'Igor Chashei']",5.0,26.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07160,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Space Physics'],,,"['Solar wind', 'Interplanetary Scintillations 1', 'Coronal Mass Ejection', 'Observation and Modeling']",2025-01-14
Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars,"In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.","['Hao Sun', 'Jia-Xing Niu', 'Hong-Bo Li', 'Cheng-Jun Xia', 'Enping Zhou', 'Yiqiu Ma', 'Ying-Xun Zhang']",9.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07188,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Nuclear Theory'],,,[],2025-01-14
Rotation periods of asteroids from light curves of TESS data,"Understanding the dynamical evolution of asteroids through the secular Yarkovsky effect requires the determination of many physical properties, including the rotation period. We propose a method aimed at obtaining a robust determination of the rotation period of asteroids, while avoiding the pitfalls of aliases. We applied this approach to thousands of asteroid light curves measured by the NASA TESS mission. We developed a robust period-analysis algorithm based on a Fourier series. Our approach includes a comparison of the results from multiple orders and tests on the number of extremes to identify and reject potential aliases. We also provide the uncertainty interval for the result as well as additional periods that may be plausible. We report the rotation period for 4521 asteroids within a precision of 10%. A comparison with the literature (whenever available) reveals a very good agreement and validates the approach presented here. Our approach also highlights cases for which the determination of the period should be considered invalid. The dataset presented here confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50 and 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is found to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less spherical. Finally, there is a systematic difference between the broad C and S complex in the amplitude-period, revealing the statistically lower density of C-types compared to S-type asteroids. Conclusions. Our approach to the determination of asteroid rotation period is based on simple concepts, yet it is nonetheless robust. It can be applied to large corpora of time series photometry, such as those extracted from exoplanet transit surveys.","['D. E. Vavilov', 'B.

Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU,"A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($<0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux.

Markarian 590: The AGN Awakens,"Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) Mkn 590 recently underwent a sudden \lq re-ignition\rq, marked by substantial increases in optical/UV and X-ray continuum flux since last year. \textit{Swift}-XRT observations revealed the re-emergence of a soft X-ray excess (SXE) as the source transitioned from a low-flux state in July 2023 to a significantly higher flux state in October 2024.

Follow-up optical spectra from the Las Cumbres Observatory confirmed the presence of dynamically broadened Balmer lines, He II emission, and the emergence of the Fe II complex. As the Eddington fraction increased by 10\% over the last 15 months, we found clear evidence of formation of a warm corona, strongly linked to the cold accretion disc underneath.

Comparison of Global HI and H$\alpha$ Line Profiles in MaNGA Galaxy Pairs with FAST,"We present case studies comparing the global HI and H$\alpha$ emission line profiles of six galaxy pairs. The six pairs are selected to have different nuclear activities, with two hosting an active galactic nucleus, and in different merging stages (two of each from pre-merging, merging, and post-merger stages). We observe their global HI spectra with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), achieving a noise level of about 0.5 mJy. Five out of the six pair systems have secure detections of HI emissions (signal-to-noise ratio > 10). The HI fraction and star formation efficiency of the six pairs do not deviate from isolated galaxies. For the HI line profiles, common unique asymmetry is observed, indicating disturbances on the atomic gas from the galaxy interaction. The global H$\alpha$ spectra of the merger systems are constructed from the optical integral field spectroscopic observations, by integrating the flux in corresponding line-of-sight velocity bins. The H$\alpha$ spectra tend to show multiple components in the pre-merger phase, and single component line profiles in the post-merger systems, while all HI spectra show single component line profiles regardless of merger stages. The HI and H$\alpha$ spectra show offsets in the central velocities, which appear to decrease from >100 km/s in the pre-merger pair to <10 km/s in post-merger pairs. This trend is consistent with the scenario that, despite the significantly different distribution and kinematics of the atomic and ionized gases, the merging process may contribute to the mixing and eventually align various gas contents.","['Gaoxiang Jin', 'Y.

"Optical and NIR spectral analysis of a post-starburst galaxy at $z \sim 2$ : probing the stellar population properties, gas content, and contribution of TP-AGB stars","We present the spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy observed at $z=1.8845$ with JWST, for which we estimate a stellar mass M$_* = 3.5\pm0.2\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_* = 198\pm10$ km/s. From the fits of the NIRspec low-resolution prism and medium resolution grating spectra, we estimate an age of $\sim0.9$ Gyr, a metallicity of $\sim -0.3$ dex, and a dust attenuation A$_{\rm V} \sim 0.7$ mag. From the H$\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines we derive a star-formation rate (SFR)$\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a specific SFR$\sim 4 \times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$. By reconstructing its SFH, we find that this galaxy formed most of its stellar mass quickly ($0.4-0.8$ Gyr) and then rapidly quenched about 0.4 Gyr lookback time. The analysis of the emission lines ([OII], [NeIII], [OIII], H$\alpha$, and [NII]) indicates a low-level residual star formation or a weak AGN as the ionization source. Further, the lack of evidence for ongoing outflows in both the absorption and emission lines tracing the neutral and ionized gas argues against the presence of strong AGN feedback. Thanks to the high quality of the data, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the NIR spectral indices. This is the first time NIR spectral indices have been investigated at such a high redshift. We find that the observed CO and CN indices are generally weak and in better agreement with models with a lower contribution from thermally pulsating (TP-)AGB stars, indicating that either TP-AGB stars do not contribute significantly to the spectrum of J-138717 or the prescriptions in the models for these evolved phases should be substantially improved. In general, we find that all models struggle to reproduce the NIR indices consistently, pointing to the importance of improving state-of-the-art stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages.","['Davide Bevacqua', 'Paolo Saracco', 'Francesco La Barbera', 'Guido De Marchi', 'Roberto De Propris', 'Fabio Ditrani', 'Anna R.

"X-ray activity of nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars and implications for planet habitability around M stars","Context. The intense X-ray and UV emission of some active M stars has raised questions about the habitability of planets around M-type stars. Aims. We aim to determine the unbiased distribution of X-ray luminosities in complete, volume-limited samples of nearby M dwarfs, and compare them to those of K and G dwarfs. Methods. We constructed volume-complete samples of 205 M stars with a spectral type $\leq$ M6 within 10 pc of the Sun, 129 K stars within 16 pc, and 107 G stars within 20 pc. We used X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ROSAT to obtain the X-ray luminosities of the stars. Results. Our samples reach an X-ray detection completeness of 85%, 86%, and 80% for M, K, and G stars, respectively. The fractional X-ray luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities, $\log(L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol})$, of the M stars show a bimodal distribution, with one peak at around -5, mostly contributed by early M stars (M0--M4), and another peak around -3.5, contributed mainly by M4--M6 stars. The comparison of the different spectral classes shows that 63% of all M stars in our sample (80% of the M stars with a spectral type $<$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ values that are within the central 80% quantile of the distribution function for G stars. In addition, 55% of all M stars in our sample (and 72% of the M stars with a spectral type $<$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ less than 10 times the solar value. Conclusions. The X-ray activity levels of the majority ($\ge 60\%$) of nearby M dwarfs no later than M6 are actually not higher than the typical (80% quantile) levels for G-type stars. The X-ray irradiation of habitable-zone planets around these stars should therefore not present a specific problem for their habitability.","['E. Zhu', 'T.

Galaxy mass-size segregation in the cosmic web from the CAVITY parent sample,"The mass-size relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law closely tied to galaxy formation and evolution. Using added-value products of the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) and SDSS DR16 images, we examine the effect of large-scale environments on the stellar mass-size relation. We analyse the Petrosian R50 and R90 radii of approximately 140000 galaxies in voids, filaments, and clusters, with a mass range of $10^{8.5} - 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We explore the relation in terms of galaxy morphology and star formation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type void galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser environments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the mass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope compared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in filaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type cluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$ are smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density environments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale environments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to grow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size growth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced minor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter slope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a trend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\approx 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, where minor mergers contribute to size growth. Conversely, late-type quenched cluster galaxies are smaller due to environmental interactions, with early infallers being most affected.","['I. Perez', 'L. Gil', 'A. Ferre-Mateu', 'G.

A multi-wavelength view of the isolated neutron star eRASSU J065715.3+260428,"The X-ray source eRASSU J065715.3+260428 was identified as a likely thermally emitting isolated neutron star in a search in the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. We investigated the nature and evolutionary state of the source through a dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaign with XMM-Newton, NICER, FAST, and ESO-VLT, complemented by the analysis of archival Fermi-LAT observations. The X-ray observations unveiled the rotation period, $P=261.085400(4)$ ms, and spin-down rate, $\dot{P}=6^{+11}_{-4}\times10^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$, of the source. No optical counterparts are detected down to 27.3 mag ($5\sigma$, R band), implying a large X-ray-to-optical flux ratio above 5200. The X-ray spectrum of the source is best described by a composite phenomenological model consisting of two thermal components, either a double blackbody continuum with temperatures 90 eV and 220 eV or a hydrogen neutron star atmosphere of temperature $\log(T/\mathrm{K})\sim 5.8$ combined with a hot blackbody of 250 eV, in both cases modified by an absorption feature at low energies ($\sim0.3$ keV). The presence of faint non-thermal hard X-ray tails is ruled out above $(2.1\pm1.8)$% of the source unabsorbed flux. Radio searches at $1-1.5$ GHz with FAST yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed flux of 1.4 $\mu$Jy ($10\sigma$). Similarly, no significant spatial or pulsed signals were detected in sixteen years of Fermi-LAT observations. The source is most likely a middle-aged spin-powered pulsar and can also be identified as PSR J0657+2604. The absence of non-thermal X-ray, radio, or gamma-ray emission within current limits suggests either an unfavourable viewing geometry or unusual magnetospheric properties. Additional observations are needed to check for faint hard X-ray tails, investigate the presence of diffuse emission from a pulsar-wind nebula, and obtain a more accurately sampled timing solution.","['J.

Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data,"There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) > 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) < 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.","['Tian-Nuo Li', 'Guo-Hong Du', 'Yun-He Li', 'Peng-Ju Wu', 'Shang-Jie Jin', 'Jing-Fei Zhang', 'Xin Zhang']",3.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07361,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-14
Science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission,"The Einstein Probe (EP) is an interdisciplinary mission of time-domain and X-ray astronomy. Equipped with a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray focusing imager, EP will discover cosmic X-ray transients and monitor the X-ray variability of known sources in 0.5-4 keV, at a combination of detecting sensitivity and cadence that is not accessible to the previous and current wide-field monitoring missions. EP can perform quick characterisation of transients or outbursts with a Wolter-I X-ray telescope onboard. In this paper, the science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission are presented. EP is expected to enlarge the sample of previously known or predicted but rare types of transients with a wide range of timescales. Among them, fast extragalactic transients will be surveyed systematically in soft X-rays, which include {\gamma}-ray bursts and their variants, supernova shock breakouts, and the predicted X-ray transients associated with binary neutron star mergers. EP will detect X-ray tidal disruption events and outbursts from active galactic nuclei, possibly at an early phase of the flares for some. EP will monitor the variability and outbursts of X-rays from white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in our and neighbouring galaxies at flux levels fainter than those detectable by the current instruments, and is expected to discover new objects. A large sample of stellar X-ray flares will also be detected and characterised. In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, EP has the potential of detecting the possible X-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, neutrino sources, and ultra-high energy {\gamma}-ray and cosmic ray sources. EP is expected to help advance the studies of extreme objects/phenomena and their underlying physical processes revealed in the dynamic X-ray universe, as well as studies in other areas of X-ray astronomy.","['Weimin Yuan', 'Lixin Dai', 'Hua Feng', 'Chichuan Jin', 'Peter Jonker', 'Erik Kuulkers', 'Yuan Liu', 'Kirpal Nandra', ""Paul O'Brien"", 'Luigi Piro', 'Arne Rau', 'Nanda Rea', 'Jeremy Sanders', 'Lian Tao', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Xuefeng Wu', 'Bing Zhang', 'Shuangnan Zhang', 'Shunke Ai', 'Johannes Buchner', 'Esra Bulbul', 'Hechao Chen', 'Minghua Chen', 'Yong Chen', 'Yu-Peng Chen', 'Alexis Coleiro', 'Francesco Coti Zelati', 'Zigao Dai', 'Xilong Fan', 'Zhou Fan', 'Susanne Friedrich', 'He Gao', 'Chong Ge', 'Mingyu Ge', 'Jinjun Geng', 'Giancarlo Ghirlanda', 'Giulia Gianfagna', 'Lijun Gou', 'Sébastien Guillot', 'Xian Hou', 'Jingwei Hu', 'Yongfeng Huang', 'Long Ji', 'Shumei Jia', 'S.

Unlocking ultra-deep wide-field imaging with sidereal visibility averaging,"Producing ultra-deep high-angular-resolution images with current and next-generation radio interferometers introduces significant computational challenges. In particular, the imaging is so demanding that processing large datasets, accumulated over hundreds of hours on the same pointing, is likely infeasible in the current data reduction schemes. In this paper, we revisit a solution to this problem that was considered in the past but is not being used in modern software: sidereal visibility averaging (SVA). This technique combines individual observations taken at different sidereal days into one much smaller dataset by averaging visibilities at similar baseline coordinates. We present our method and validated it using four separate 8-hour observations of the ELAIS-N1 deep field, taken with the International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) at 140~MHz. Additionally, we assessed the accuracy constraints imposed by Earth's orbital motion relative to the observed pointing when combining multiple datasets. We find, with four observations, data volume reductions of a factor of 1.8 and computational time improvements of a factor of 1.6 compared to standard imaging. These factors will increase when more observations are combined with SVA. For instance, with 3000~hours of LOFAR data aimed at achieving sensitivities of the order of {\mu}Jy/beam at sub-arcsecond resolutions, we estimate data volume reductions of up to a factor of 169 and a 14-fold decrease in computing time using our current algorithm. This advancement for imaging large deep interferometric datasets will benefit current generation instruments, such as LOFAR, and upcoming instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), provided the calibrated visibility data of the individual observations are retained.","['J.M.G.H.J. de Jong', 'R.J. van Weeren', 'T.J.

Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments,"Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for computing the afterglow emission. Our procedure is general and applicable to any jet simulation of the same kind.","['Emma Dreas', 'Andrea Pavan', 'Riccardo Ciolfi', 'Annalisa Celotti']",15.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07385,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – gamma-ray burst: general – stars: jets – relativistic processes – methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-14
Is planetary inward migration responsible for GJ 504's fast rotation and bright X-ray luminosity? New constraints from eROSITA,"The discovery of an increasing variety of exoplanets in very close orbits around their host stars raised many questions about how stars and planets interact, and to which extent host stars' properties may be influenced by the presence of close-by companions. Understanding how the evolution of stars is impacted by the interactions with their planets is fundamental to disentangle their intrinsic evolution from Star-Planet Interactions (SPI)-induced phenomena. GJ 504 is a promising candidate for a star that underwent strong SPI. Its unusually short rotational period (3.4 days), while being in contrast with what is expected by single-star models, could result from the inward migration of a close-by, massive companion, pushed starward by tides. Moreover, its brighter X-ray luminosity may hint at a rejuvenation of the dynamo process sustaining the stellar magnetic field, consequent to the SPI-induced spin-up. We aim to study the evolution of GJ 504 and establish whether by invoking the engulfment of a planetary companion we can better reproduce its rotational period and X-ray luminosity. We simulate the past evolution assuming two different scenarios: 'Star without close-by planet', 'Star with close-by planet'. In the second scenario, we investigate how inward migration and planetary engulfment driven by tides spin up the stellar surface and rejuvenate its dynamo. We compare our tracks with rotational period and X-ray data collected from the all-sky surveys of the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). Despite the very uncertain stellar age, we found that the second evolutionary scenario is in better agreement with the short rotational period and the bright X-ray luminosity of GJ 504, thus strongly favouring the inward migration scenario over the one in which close-by planets have no tidal impact on the star.","['C.

Dusty disk as a safe haven for terrestrial planets: Effect of back-reaction of solid material on gas,"Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We perform locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations are compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component is assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St<=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2<=St<=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.","['Zs.

A Study of thin relativistic magnetic accretion disk around a distorted black hole,"Accretion disks, swirling structures of matter spiraling into black holes, play a pivotal role in our understanding of binary star systems and their intricate evolutionary processes. While current models often simplify these complex phenomena by neglecting the influence of powerful magnetic fields, particularly within warped or distorted black hole geometries, this study delves into the crucial impact of such fields. Focusing on a thin accretion disk encircling a Schwarzschild black hole, we meticulously investigate how the presence of a quadrupole moment, an inherent distortion in the black hole's shape, affects its spectral characteristics. By analyzing key parameters like total pressure, magnetic pressure, temperature, height scale, surface density, and radiative flux (the energy emitted by the disk) we reveal significant alterations induced by incorporating both magnetic fields and a quadrupole moment. Notably, our findings demonstrate that negative quadrupoles exert a more pronounced influence on these disk properties, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors. This comprehensive study provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of accretion disks surrounding distorted black holes with magnetic fields, paving the way for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of these fascinating astrophysical systems.","['Seyyed Masoud Hoseyni', 'Jamshid Ghanbari', 'Mahboobe Moeen Moghaddas']",8.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07407,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,quadrupole accretion disk predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity has spurred extensive theoretical investigation distorted schwarzschild black hole ,2025-01-14
First mid-infrared detection and modeling of a flare from Sgr A*,"The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths $\sim$40--70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at $1.3~\mathrm{mm}$ with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by $\approx$10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.","['Sebastiano D. von Fellenberg', 'Tamojeet Roychowdhury', 'Joseph M.

The GRACE project: Hard X-ray giant radio galaxies and their duty cycle,"The advent of new generation radio telescopes is opening new possibilities on the classification and study of extragalactic high-energy sources, specially the underrepresented ones like radio galaxies. Among these, Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG, larger than 0.7 Mpc) are among the most extreme manifestations of the accretion/ejection processes on supermassive black holes. Our recent studies have shown that GRG can be up to four times more abundant in hard X-ray selected (i.e. from INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT at $>$20 keV) samples and, most interestingly, the majority of them present signs of restarted radio activity. This makes them the ideal test-bed to study the so far unknown duty cycle of jets in active galactic nuclei. Open questions in the field include: How and when jets are restarted? How jets evolve and what's their dynamic? What is the jet's duty cycle and what triggers them? Our group has recently collected a wealth of radio data on these high-energy selected GRGs, allowing us to study their jet formation and evolution from the pc to kpc scales, across different activity epochs. In particular, thanks to our EVN large programme, we were able to probe the new radio phase in the core of these giants. Furthermore, we are devoting an effort to the exploitation of new radio surveys data for the discovery of new classes of counterparts of Fermi/LAT catalogues.

MeerKAT HI imaging of the jellyfish galaxy ESO 137-001,"We present MeerKAT HI observations of ESO 137-001, a quintessential jellyfish galaxy with long multi-phase tails formed due to the interaction with the intra-cluster medium of its host galaxy cluster, ACO 3627. Our observations reveal the presence of HI in both the disc and outer regions of the galaxy for the first time, with a total HI mass of ($3.5 \pm\ 0.4) \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. ESO 137-001 is at an advanced stage of gas stripping; it is extremely HI deficient and seems to have lost 90% of its initial HI mass; about 2/3 of the surviving HI is found at a larger radius than expected for a normal HI disc and forms a $\sim40$ kpc tail coincident with the tail detected at other wavelengths. Only $\sim10$% of the surviving HI is still found within the stellar disc, consistent with the expectation of an outside-in truncation due to ram pressure. Similarly to other jellyfish galaxies, ESO137-001 has a high star formation rate for the low amount of HI detected. We measure an HI depletion time of 0.29 Gyr. However, when taking into account the total gas (HI + H$_2$) content, the depletion time is consistent with typical values measured in nearby spiral galaxies. This suggests that ESO 137-001 is at its current stage of ram pressure interaction characterised by an efficient HI stripping, rather than an enhanced conversion of HI to H$_2$, which was recently observed in some other jellyfish galaxies.","['M.

A flux-limited sample of dusty star-forming galaxies from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope: physical properties and the case for multiplicity,"We report the modeling of the millimeter and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of 71 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with a lower flux-density limit of 8 mJy at 220 GHz (1.4 mm). All sources were cross-identified with Herschel surveys at 500, 350, and 250 {\mu}m, and nineteen of our sources were observed at with the Submillimeter Array. A probabilistic cataloging algorithm, PCAT, favors multiple unresolved flux components in the Herschel data for the majority of ACT-selected DSFGs. We compare the derived physical properties of the DSFGs obtained from modeling the flux densities with those from similar studies of both lensed and unlensed DSFG populations. We find the median, 16th and 84th percentiles for the following model parameters: redshift zphot=3.3(+0.7)(-0.6), apparent size {\mu}d=5.2(+0.9)(-2.4) kpc, apparent dust mass log10({\mu}Md/Msun)=9.14(+0.12)(-0.04) and cutoff temperature Tc=35.6(+4.8)(-1.6) K, and the corresponding apparent far-infrared luminosity log10({\mu}LIR/Lsun)=13.6(+0.2)(-0.3), where {\mu} is lensing magnification. While many of the properties broadly agree with those of samples of primarily lensed DSFGs, we exercise caution in interpreting them. ACT's lower flux limit, the PCAT decomposition, and the higher-resolution SMA observations all suggest that some fraction of these DSFGs are likely to be unlensed and possibly multiples. The SMA data indicate that at least fourteen out of nineteen sources are such, either via ""missing"" flux in comparison to the ensemble model or detection of additional sources in the fields. Additional high-resolution follow-up and targeted redshift observations are needed to better understand this flux-limited sample of DSFGs.","['Kirsten R. Hall', 'Jake Hassan', 'Richard M.

Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?,"Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.","['Pierre Dumond', 'Gilles Chabrier']",6.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07436,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],A&A,,"['Methods: analytical — Stars: formation', 'mass function — Turbulence 1', 'luminosity function']",2025-01-14
Metal-THINGS: The Milky Way twin candidate NGC 3521,"The 3D spectrophotometry measurements of the galaxy NGC~3521, a structural Milky Way analogue (sMWA), were carried out within the Metal-THINGS project. We found that the oxygen abundance in the inner part of NGC~3521 is at a nearly constant level and the O/H gradient is negative at larger radii. The change in the N/H with radius is similar to that for O/H. The radial distributions of the O/H, the gas mass fraction, and the effective oxygen yield in NGC~3521 are compared to that of the Milky Way (MW), with the aim of examining the similarity in their chemical evolutions. The O/H of two HII regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned O/H in NGC~3521 at the same galactocentric distances. The O/H in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC~3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC~3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Yeff, in NGC~3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Yo. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Yeff in the MW were determined using two variants of the distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Yeff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Yo. The Yeff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Yo at radii between 6 and 10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.","['L.S.

Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole,"We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., O, A, and I-types), including the shock solutions, are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the accretion solutions are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the BH horizon. In this context, we also observe that various shock properties, such as the shock radius, flow density compression, and temperature compression across the shock fronts, are potentially affected by the dark halo. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow angular momentum and energy, is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. Furthermore, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED), slope of the SED, and bolometric luminosity, are found to exhibit strong deviations from the known results in the usual Schwarzschild BH model. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic BH.","['Subhankar Patra', 'Bibhas Ranjan Majhi']",7.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07456,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,['accretion'],2025-01-14
Deep Needlet: A CNN based full sky component separation method in Needlet space,"One of the most important steps of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is component separation to recover CMB map by combining the observations contaminated by foregrounds. Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum variance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to recover CMB. This work develops a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recover CMB map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over the full sky. The model allows to perform component separation with a multi-resolution representation of spherical data localized on both pixel space and harmonic space with rotational invariant features of CMB. The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit different foreground complexities. The model achieves precise recovery of the CMB temperature map and the TT power spectrum exhibits excellent agreement with true value up to $\ell\sim$1100. The residual leakage to the recovered CMB is reduced significantly compared to the CMB map recovered using NILC pipeline. Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3 data to recover CMB. The recovered CMB map shows excellent agreement with CMB maps of Planck legacy products using NILC and SMICA pipelines.

Model-independent forecasts for the cosmological anisotropic stress,"The effective anisotropic stress $\eta$ is a key variable in the characterization of many classes of modified gravity theories, as it allows the testing for a long-range force additional to gravity. In this paper we forecast the precision with which future large surveys can determine $\eta$ in a way that only relies on directly observable quantities obtained from the spectroscopic measurements of the clustering of galaxies and the photometric based observation of the projected lensing and galaxy clustering correlations and their cross signal. Our method does not require further assumptions about the initial power spectrum, the modified gravity model, the expansion rate, or the bias. We consider various cases: $\eta$ free to vary in space and time, or with only redshift dependence, or constant. We take as a reference specifications that approximate a Euclid-like photometric or a combined one with a DESI-like spectroscopic survey. Among our results, we find that a future large-scale lensing and clustering survey can constrain $\eta$ to at least 30\% if $z$, $k$ independent, and to less than 10\% on average for the $z$ dependence only, to finally reach 5\% values in the constant case.","['Ziad Sakr', 'Ziyang Zheng', 'Santiago Casas']",7.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07477,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Cosmology: observations – Gravity – dark matter – dark energy 1 INTRODUCTION Withthelatestconstraintsonthecosmologicalparametersfromthecosmicmicrowavebackground(CMB)correlationmeasurementsfromthe Planck satellite (Aghanim et al'],2025-01-14
Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in Binary White Dwarfs,"This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. Traditionally, these systems consist of two low-mass stars or a more massive WD paired with a less massive companion. In addition, recent work has investigated the possibility that double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic WDs , particularly SDSS J221141.80 + 113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9 + 145808.7 (hereafter J1901 + 14588). Motivated by these findings and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) prospects, this study aims to calculate the tidal Love number, the dimensionless tidal deformability, as well as the frequency and amplitude of GWs of hot WDs. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating stronger GWs. Additionally, the analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly, reaching a limit that aligns with the operational detection capabilities of LISA during its initial phase.","['Sílvia P.

A critical evaluation of the elemental abundances and evolutionary status of 15 Vul (HD 189849): The first identification of an evolved Am star,"Understanding the evolution of metallic-line (Am) stars requires well determined atmospheric parameters and abundance patterns of the selected candidates. In this study, we presented a detailed abundance analysis of 15 Vul (HD 189849), identified as a marginal Am star, using a combination of equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques, under the LTE assumption. We compared our findings to previous analyses of the star, providing critique on both their results and our own. Our results suggest that although 15 Vul exhibits some underabundances of calcium and scandium, which are typically associated with Am stars, it might be more accurately identified as a normal A star in terms of its abundance pattern of all other elements and microturbulence velocity. The star's position on the HR diagram, along with our findings, may indicate that it is potentially a classical Am star that has evolved into the subgiant phase as a ""quasi-normal"" star. This may be the first identification of an evolved Am star.","['M. Taşkın Çay', 'İpek H.

Deriving the abundance distribution of HII galaxies using sulphur as tracer: Exploring the high-metallicity end,"The main objective of this work is to derive the distribution of the the metal content of HII galaxies using sulphur as an abundance tracer. This increases the metallicity range that can safely be reached. We selected a sample of emission-line galaxies that we extracted from the SDSS-DR16. These objects have a redshift of z less than 0.04 so that the [SIII] 9069 A emission line and H beta equivalent widths that are higher than 10 A in emission were included, and they are compact in appearance. We used the so-called direct method for objects with the electron-temperature-sensitive [SIII] 6312 A emission line, and an empirical method based on the S23 parameter. The last provided an abundance calibration that monotonically increased up to at least the solar value, and can be applied based on the spectral range from 6000 to 9500 A alone. We show that the bias that is introduced when the [OIII] 4363 A line is required restricts the sample to objects with an [OIII] electron temperature higher than 10,000K, and their temperature distribution is then rather narrow. For objects with determinations of te [SIII], the distribution is flatter and wider, which fits a more realistic scenario better. For the objects in the sample that required the detection of the [OIII] 4363 A line and [SIII] 6312 A, the distribution abundances as traced directly by oxygen and sulphur appear to be very similar to each other. However, when the restriction for weak temperature-sensitive lines is relaxed, the abundance distribution is wider . In summary, the abundance distributions traced by sulphur can reach reliable abundances up to the solar value at least and provide a more complete picture of the metallicity distribution of HII galaxies.","['Marta Gavilán', 'Ángeles I.

Three-dimensional transport of solids in a protoplanetary disk containing a growing giant planet,"We present the results of combined hydrodynamic and particle tracking post-processing modeling to study the transport of small dust in a protoplanetary disk containing an embedded embryo in 3D. We use a suite of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations of disks containing a planetary embryo varying in mass up to 300 $M_\oplus$ on a fixed orbit in both high and low viscosity disks. We then simulate solid particles through the disk as a post-processing step using a Monte Carlo integration, allowing us to track the trajectories of individual particles as they travel throughout the disk. We find that gas advection onto the planet can carry small, well-coupled solids across the gap opened in the disk by the embedded planet for planetary masses above the pebble isolation mass. This mixing between the inner and outer disk can occur in both directions, with solids in the inner disk mixing to the outer disk as well. Additionally, in low viscosity disks, multiple pile-ups in the outer disk may preserve isotopic heterogeneities, possibly providing an outermost tertiary isotopic reservoir. Throughout Jupiter's growth, the extent of mixing between isotopic reservoirs varied depending on dust size, gas turbulence, and the Jovian embryo mass.","['Eric Van Clepper', 'Ellen M.

Magnetically arrested disk flux eruption events to describe SgrA* flares,"Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots, formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light. Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ, 180^\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise naturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for reproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.","['Eleni Antonopoulou', 'Argyrios Loules', 'Antonios Nathanail']",7.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07521,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['black hole physics – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – radiative transfer – Galaxy:center – relativistic processes 1'],2025-01-14
Testing $\gamma\delta$CDM Model in the Redshift Bins,"The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe, being of the order 5$\sigma$. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current cosmological model, indicating unknown new physics, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations. In this work, we investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble constant in the $\gamma\delta$CDM cosmological model, which is a new cosmological model based on $f(R)$ gravity in an anisotropic background. Through data analysis with the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, the cosmic chronometers Hubble, and both the old and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation data, we establish that the Hubble constant in our model does not evolve with redshift. We also confirm that our model fits the aforementioned data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model by checking various information criteria. The value of the Hubble constant obtained in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is in the 1$\sigma$ bound of the late Universe observations.","['Furkan Şakir Dilsiz', 'Cemsinan Deliduman', 'Selinay Sude Binici']",14.0,26.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07538,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-14
Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport,"Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.","['Evan Grohs', 'Sherwood Richers', 'Julien Froustey', 'Francois Foucart', 'James P.

"Compact Size, High $\Sigma$SFR: Defining Morphological Features of Ly$\alpha$-Emitters","The mechanisms of Ly$\alpha$ photon escape are key to understanding galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization, yet remain poorly understood. We investigate the UV-continuum sizes of 23 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at Cosmic Noon ($1.7 < z < 3.3$), extending previous size analyses to include fainter galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -14$) using gravitational lensing. Our results show that these LAEs are unusually small for their luminosity, with a mean effective radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of $170 \pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct size-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$ approximately three times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar redshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift Green Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across redshifts. We also find that Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)) increases with decreasing $r_{\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The small sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR $= 1-600 M_{\sun} \ \rm{yr}^{-1} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), clearly separating them from typical SFGs in the $\Sigma$SFR vs. $r_{\rm eff}$ space. Given that high $\Sigma$SFR is linked to strong galactic outflows, our findings imply that compact morphology plays a key role in Ly$\alpha$ escape, likely facilitated by outflows that clear under-dense channels in the ISM. Thus, these results demonstrate that compact size and high $\Sigma$SFR can help identify Ly$\alpha$-emitters.","['Keunho Kim', 'Anahita Alavi', 'Christopher Snapp-Kolas', 'Brian Siana', 'Johan Richard', 'Harry Teplitz', 'James Colbert', 'Vihang Mehta', 'Ana Paulino-Afonso', 'Eros Vanzella']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07548,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Euclid: Optimising tomographic redshift binning for 3$\times$2pt power spectrum constraints on dark energy,"We present a simulation-based method to explore the optimum tomographic redshift binning strategy for 3x2pt analyses with Euclid, focusing on the expected configuration of its first major data release (DR1). To do this, we 1) simulate a Euclid-like observation and generate mock shear catalogues from multiple realisations of the 3x2pt fields on the sky, and 2) measure the 3x2pt Pseudo-Cl power spectra for a given tomographic configuration and derive the constraints that they place on the standard dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). For a simulation including Gaussian-distributed photometric redshift uncertainty and shape noise under a LambdaCDM cosmology, we find that bins equipopulated with galaxies yield the best constraints on (w0, wa) for an analysis of the full 3x2pt signal, or the angular clustering component only. For the cosmic shear component, the optimum (w0, wa) constraints are achieved by bins equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance. However, the advantage with respect to alternative binning choices is only a few percent in the size of the $1\,\sigma\,$(w0, wa) contour, and we conclude that the cosmic shear is relatively insensitive to the binning methodology. We find that the information gain extracted on (w0, wa) for any 3x2pt component starts to saturate at $\gtrsim$ 7-8 bins. Any marginal gains resulting from a greater number of bins is likely to be limited by additional uncertainties present in a real measurement, and the increasing demand for accuracy of the covariance matrix. Finally, we consider a 5% contamination from catastrophic photometric redshift outliers and find that, if these errors are not mitigated in the analysis, the bias induced in the 3x2pt signal for 10 equipopulated bins results in dark energy constraints that are inconsistent with the fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology at $>5\,\sigma$.","['J.

A reference framework for extremely metal-poor OB star studies: calibrations for stellar parameters and intrinsic colours,"We provide the first reference framework for extremely metal-poor (XMP) OB-type stars. We parsed a grid of 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ FASTWIND models, covering the parameter space of O stars and early-B supergiants, through contemporary spectral classification criteria to deliver a calibration of key stellar properties as a function of spectral type, and tabulated colours for the most common photometric systems. By using an extensive grid of models, we account for the different combinations of stellar parameters that result in the same spectral morphology and provide a range of parameters and colours compatible with each spectral subtype and luminosity class. We supply updated photometric criteria to optimize candidate selection of OB stars in XMP environments. We find 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ OB stars are 1-6 kK hotter and produce higher ionizing fluxes than their Galactic analogues. In addition, we find a bimodal distribution of the HeII-ionizing flux with spectral type; because of its known dependence on effective temperature and the wind, $\log~q_{HeII}$ for individual XMP late-O type stars could be underestimated by up to 4 orders of magnitude by other calibrations, some of them used by population synthesis codes. Finally, we used our calibrated colours to map the extinction of the 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ galaxy Sextans A finding that reddening is non-negligible and uneven.","['Marta Lorenzo', 'Miriam Garcia', 'Norberto Castro', 'Francisco Najarro', 'Miguel Cerviño', 'Artemio Herrero', 'Sergio Simón-Díaz']",23.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07569,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['stars:massive–stars:early-type–stars:evolution–stars:fundamentalparameters–stars:PopulationIII–galaxies: individual: Sextans A 1 INTRODUCTION In a Universe whose average metal content has been ever-growing sincetheBigBang', 'defined as≤0', 'thestudyofextremelymetal-poor(XMP']",2025-01-14
The Guitar's Magnetic Field Revealed by Starlight Polarization,The Guitar nebula surrounding PSR B2224+65 boasts a pulsar X-ray filament likely aligned with the local magnetic field. We present new RoboPol stellar polarization data distributed along the line-of-sight to the pulsar. The polarizing effect of intervening magnetized dust allows us to extract a model for the dust-weighted magnetic field.

Cosmic quenching and scaling laws for the evolution of supermassive black holes and host galaxies,"Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit.

Helical Magnetic Field in a Massive Protostellar Jet,"Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.","['A. Rodríguez-Kamenetzky', 'A.

Cross-correlating the patchy screening and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects as a new probe of reionization,"The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and patchy screening effect are two complementary cosmic microwave background (CMB) probes of the reionization era. The kSZ effect is a relatively strong signal, but is difficult to disentangle from other sources of temperature anisotropy, whereas patchy screening is weaker but can be reconstructed using the cleaner polarization channel. Here, we explore the potential of using upcoming CMB surveys to correlate a reconstructed map of patchy screening with (the square of) the kSZ map, and what a detection of this cross-correlation would mean for reionization science. To do this, we use simulations and theory to quantify the contributions to this signal from different redshifts. We then use the expected survey properties for CMB-S4 and CMB-HD to make detection forecasts before exploring how the signal depends on reionization parameters. We forecast that CMB-S4 will obtain a hint of this signal at up to 1.8$\sigma$ and CMB-HD will detect it at up to 14$\sigma$. We find that this signal contains unique information about the timing and morphology of reionization, particularly sensitivity to the first half of reionization and to the bispectrum of the ionized gas distribution.","['Darby Kramer', 'Alexander van Engelen', 'Christopher Cain', 'Niall MacCrann', 'Hy Trac', 'Skylar Grayson', 'Evan Scannapieco', 'Blake Sherwin']",9.0,17.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07623,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['observational cosmology', 'cosmic microwave background', 'circumgalactic medium', 'reionization', 'Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect 1']",2025-01-15
Protostellar disc structure and dynamics during star formation from cloud-scale initial conditions,"The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. The magnetic field is wound up by rotational motions, generating a magneto-centrifugal outflow, while episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure and an Alfvén Mach number of ~ 2. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs.","['Trey Qingyun Yang', 'Christoph Federrath']",16.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07626,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],MNRAS,,"['accretion discs – ISM: jets and outflows – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – stars: formation – stars: protostars – turbulence 1 INTRODUCTION Star formation is a fundamental process shaping the structure and evolutionoftheinterstellarmedium(ISM)', 'accretion']",2025-01-15
"Discovery of Ancient Globular Cluster Candidates in The Relic, a Quiescent Galaxy at z=2.5","Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.","['Katherine E.

A novel Bayesian approach for decomposing the radio emission of quasars: II. Link between quasar radio emission and black hole mass,"Whether the mass of supermassive black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) is directly linked to the quasar radio luminosity remains a long-debated issue, and understanding the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in the evolution of quasars is pivotal to unveiling the mechanism of AGN feedback. In this work, based on a two-component Bayesian model, we examine how $M_\mathrm{BH}$ affects the radio emission from quasars, separating the contributions from host galaxy star formation (SF) and AGN activity. By modelling the radio flux density distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. The same holds for AGN activity across most $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values; however, quasars with the top 20\% most massive SMBHs are 2 to 3 times more likely to host strong radio jets than those with lower-mass SMBHs at similar redshift and luminosity. We suggest defining radio quasar populations by their AGN and SF contributions instead of radio loudness; our new definition unifies previously divergent observational results on the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in quasar radio emissions. We further demonstrate that this radio enhancement in quasars with the 20\% most massive SMBHs affects only the $\sim5\%$ most radio bright quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. We discuss possible physical origins of this radio excess in the most massive and radio-bright quasar population, which remains an interest for future study.","['B.-H. Yue', 'K. J. Duncan', 'P. N.

Ultra-Light Dark Matter Simulations and Stellar Dynamics: Tension in Dwarf Galaxies for $m < 5\times10^{-21} $ eV,"We present numerical simulations of dark matter and stellar dynamics in Ultra Light Dark Matter halos tailored to mimic dwarf galaxies. For dark matter particle mass $m\approx 1\times 10^{-22}$ eV, dynamical heating causes the half-light radius to over-shoot surface brightness data of the Fornax galaxy. For $m\approx 1\times 10^{-21}$ eV, soliton core formation leads to a velocity dispersion peak incompatible with kinematics data. Extending the analysis to the Carina and Leo II galaxies, the tension persists up to $m\approx 5\times 10^{-21}$ eV. A caveat in our analysis is the omission of stellar self-gravity. This would not change dynamics today, but could affect extrapolation back in time if the stellar body was more compact in the past.","['Luca Teodori', 'Andrea Caputo', 'Kfir Blum']",10.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07631,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-15
The coexistence of the streaming instability and the vertical shear instability in protoplanetary disks: Scale-dependence of dust diffusion,"The vertical shear instability and the streaming instability are two robust sources of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. The former has been found to induce anisotropic turbulence that is stronger in the vertical than in the radial dimension and to be overall stronger compared to the largely isotropic turbulence caused by the streaming instability. In this study, we shed light on the dust diffusion by the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability separately and together, and in particular on the direction- and scale-dependence of the diffusion. To this end, we employ two-dimensional global models of the two instabilities either in isolation or in combination. The vertical shear instability in isolation diffuses dust more strongly in the vertical direction than the streaming instability in isolation, resulting in a wave-shaped dust layer in our two-dimensional simulations. Compared with this large-scale diffusion, though, our study highlights that the vertical shear instability causes substantially weaker or even negligible small-scale diffusion. We validate this result using previously published three-dimensional simulations. In particular when simulating centimetre-sized dust, the undulating dust layer becomes internally razor-thin. In contrast, the diffusion owing to the streaming instability exhibits only a marginal scale-dependence, with the dust layer possessing a Gaussian shape. In models including both instabilities, the undulating mid-plane layer is broadened to a width set by the intrinsic diffusion level caused by the streaming instability.","['Urs Schäfer', 'Anders Johansen', 'Mario Flock']",8.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07633,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics – instabilities – turbulence – methods: numerical – protoplanetary disks 1'],2025-01-15
The uncommon intracluster medium features of the first massive clusters selected independently of their baryon content,"Our current knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters selected by their minority components: hot baryons. Most of these studies select the clusters using the component that is being investigated, the intracluster medium (ICM), making the sample choice prone to selection effects. Weak-gravitational lensing allows us to select clusters by the total mass component and, being independent of the type of matter, makes the sample choice unbiased with respect to the baryon content. In this paper, we study four galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift ($0.25<z<0.61$), selected from the weak-lensing survey of Miyazaki et al. (2018). We derive core-excised X-ray luminosities, richness-based masses, Compton parameters, and profiles of mass, pressure and electron densities. These quantities are derived from shear data, Compton maps, and our own X-ray and SZ follow-up. When compared to ICM-selected clusters of the same mass, in the range $2$ to $5 \ 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, our small sample of four clusters is expected to have on average 0.2 rare ($>2\sigma$) features, while we observed on average two rare features in each one of the seven explored properties: richness, core-excised luminosity, Compton parameter, pressure and electron pressure profiles, and central values of them. The abundance of rare and unique features in such a small sample indicates a fundamental bias in our knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of clusters when derived from ICM-selected samples.","['S.

Inadequate turbulent support in low-metallicity molecular clouds,"The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy ($E_{\rm k}$) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy ($E_{\rm g}$), setting their virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}=2E_{\rm k}/|E_{\rm g}|\approx1$. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically-thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighborhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gc}<R_{\rm gc,\odot} \approx 8$ kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin $^{13}$CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc}\sim9-24$ kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend of $\alpha_{\rm vir}$, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.","['Lingrui Lin', 'Zhi-Yu Zhang', 'Junzhi Wang', 'Padelis P.

NuSTAR observations of a varying-flux quasar in the Epoch of Reionization,"With enough X-ray flux to be detected in a 160s scan by SRG/eROSITA, the $z = 6.19$ quasar CFHQS J142952+544717 is, by far, the most luminous X-ray source known at $z > 6$. We present deep (245 ks) NuSTAR observations of this source; with $\sim180$ net counts in the combined observations, CFHQS J142952+544717 is the most distant object ever observed by the observatory. Fortuitously, this source was independently observed by Chandra $\sim110$ days earlier, enabling the identification of two nearby (30'' and 45'' away), fainter X-ray sources. We jointly fit both Chandra and NuSTAR observations--self-consistently including interloper sources--and find that, to greater than 90% confidence, the observed 3-7 keV flux varied by a factor of $\sim2.6$ during that period, corresponding to approximately two weeks in the quasar rest-frame. This brightening is one the most extreme instances of statistically significant X-ray variability seen in the Epoch of Reionization.

PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics,"Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.57^{+0.37}_{-0.38}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.86^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within <500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}<1.43$ and $M_{SW}<1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($>r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away"" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.","['Andra Stroe', 'Kamlesh Rajpurohit', 'Zhenlin Zhu', 'Lorenzo Lovisari', 'Aurora Simionescu', ""Ewan O'Sullivan"", 'Scott Randall', 'William Forman', 'Hiroki Akamatsu', 'Reinout van Weeren', 'M.

Numerical and Physical Challenges to Nebular Spectroscopy in Thermonuclear Supernovae,"Thermodynamical explosions of White Dwarfs (WD)are one of the keys to high precision cosmology. Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark. At some examples, we establish the power of high-precision nebular spectroscopy as quantitative tool.

3D MC II: X ray echoes reveal a clumpy molecular cloud in the CMZ,"X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068°, b = -0.076°) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.","['Danya Alboslani', 'Cara Battersby', 'Samantha Brunker', 'Maïca Clavel', 'Daniel Walker', 'Dani Lipman']",11.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07669,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-15
On the accuracy of dark matter halo merger trees and the consequences for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation,"Galaxy formation and evolution models, such as semi-analytic models, are powerful theoretical tools for predicting how galaxies evolve across cosmic time. These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly histories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process requires codes to identify halos (""halo finder"") and to track their time evolution (""tree builder""). While these codes generally perform well, they encounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we present how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly histories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between subhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late cosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo finder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT+HERONS) and tree builder codes (D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT+HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\%$ ($80\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $>10^{3}$ ($>10^{4}$) particles at $z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT+HERONS, which explicitly incorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these artefacts to $5\%$ ($10\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and GALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We demonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies hosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons relies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the numerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the improvements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.","['Ángel Chandro-Gómez', 'Claudia del P.

"The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field","PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.","['V.

Cassiopeia A's Reverse Shock and its Effects on the Expanding SN Ejecta,"Using optical and near-infrared images of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant covering the time period 1951 to 2022, together with optical spectra of selected filaments, we present an investigation of Cas A's reverse shock velocity and the effects it has on the remnant's metal-rich ejecta. We find the sequence of optical ejecta brightening and the appearance of new optical ejecta indicating the advancement of the remnant's reverse shock in the remnant's main shell has velocities typically between 1000 and 2000 km/s, which is ~1000 km/s less than recent measurements made in X-rays. We further find the reverse shock appears to move much more slowly and is nearly even stationary in the sky frame along the remnant's western limb. However, we do not find the reverse shock to move inward at velocities as large as ~2000 km/s as has been reported. Optical ejecta in Cas A's main emission shell have proper motions indicating outward tangential motions ~3500 - 6000 km/s, with the smaller values preferentially along the remnant's southern regions which we speculate may be partially the cause of the remnant's faint and more slowly evolving southern sections. Following interaction with the reverse shock, ejecta knots exhibit extended mass ablated trails 0.2"" - 0.5"" in length leading to extended emission indicating reverse shock induced decelerated velocities as large as 1000 km/s. Such ablated material is most prominently seen in higher ionization line emissions, whereas denser parts of ejecta knots show surprisingly little deceleration.","['Robert A.

Towards a self-consistent hydrodynamical model of the solar tachocline,"The solar tachocline is an internal boundary layer in the Sun located between the differentially-rotating convection zone and the uniformly-rotating radiative interior beneath. Spiegel and Zahn (1992) proposed the first hydrodynamical model, which here we call SZ92, arguing that the tachocline is essentially in a steady state of thermal-wind balance, angular-momentum balance, and thermal equilibrium. Angular momentum transport in their model is assumed to be dominated by strongly anisotropic turbulence, primarily horizontal owing to the strong stable stratification of the radiative interior. By contrast, the heat transport is assumed to be dominated by a predominantly vertical diffusive heat flux owing to the thinness of the tachocline. In this paper, we demonstrate that these assumptions are not consistent with the new model of stratified turbulence recently proposed by Chini et al. (2022) and Shah et al. (2024), which has been numerically validated by Garaud et al. (2024). We then propose a simple self-consistent alternative to the SZ92 model, namely, a scenario wherein angular momentum and heat transport are both dominated by horizontal turbulent diffusion. The thickness of the tachocline in the new model scales as $\Omega_\odot / N_m$, where $\Omega_\odot$ is the mean angular velocity of the Sun, and $N_m$ the buoyancy frequency in the tachocline region. We discuss other properties of the model, and show that it has several desirable features, but does not resolve some of the other well-known problems of the SZ92 model.","['P. Garaud', 'D. O.

3D MC I: X-ray Tomography Begins to Unravel the 3-D Structure of a Molecular Cloud in our Galaxy's Center,"Astronomers have used observations of the Galactic gas and dust via infrared, microwave, and radio to study molecular clouds in extreme environments such as the Galactic center. More recently, X- ray telescopes have opened up a new wavelength range in which to study these molecular clouds. Previous flaring events from SgrA* propagate X-rays outwards in all directions, and these X-rays interact with the surrounding molecular gas, illuminating different parts of the clouds over time. We use a combination of X-ray observations from Chandra and molecular gas tracers (line data from Herschel and the Submillimeter Array) to analyze specific features in the Sticks cloud, one of three clouds in the Three Little Pigs system in the Central Molecular Zone (Galactic longitude and latitude of 0.106 and -0.082 degrees respectively). We also present a novel X-ray tomography method we used to create 3-D map of the Sticks cloud. By combining X-ray and molecular tracer observations, we are able to learn more about the environment inside the Sticks cloud.","['Samantha W.

Timing and noise analysis of five millisecond pulsars observed with MeerKAT,"Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in binary systems are precise laboratories for tests of gravity and the physics of dense matter. Their orbits can show relativistic effects that provide a measurement of the neutron star mass and the pulsars are included in timing array experiments that search for gravitational waves. Neutron star mass measurements are key to eventually solving the neutron star equation of state and these can be obtained by a measure of the Shapiro delay if the orbit is viewed near edge-on. Here we report on the timing and noise analysis of five MSPs observed with the MeerKAT radio telescope: PSRs J0900$-$3144, J0921$-$5202, J1216$-$6410, J1327$-$0755 and J1543$-$5149. We searched for the Shapiro delay in all of the pulsars and obtain weak detections for PSRs J0900$-$3144, J1216$-$6410, and J1327$-$0755. We report a higher significance detection of the Shapiro delay for PSR J1543$-$5149, giving a precise pulsar mass of $M_{\rm p} = 1.349^{+0.043}_{-0.061}\,$M$_\odot$ and companion white-dwarf mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.223^{+0.005}_{-0.007}\,$M$_\odot$.

Design and Performance of a Universal SiPM Readout System for X- and Gamma-Ray Missions,"The advent of both multi-messenger and time-domain astrophysics over the last decade has seen a large interest in the development of small-scale, cheap, and robust gamma-ray detectors. This has been further encouraged by the availability of CubeSat platforms. Of particular interest are detectors capable of producing spectral and localization measurements of X and gamma-ray transients to allow for accurate follow-up measurements at different wavelengths. A vast number of the instruments developed for such purposes in the last years use a combination of scintillators and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) for photon detection. Here, we present the design, performance, and space qualification of a readout system capable of reading out 64 SiPM channels. This low-power and low-cost system was originally designed for the POLAR-2 mission, a large scale gamma-ray polarimeter. However, its flexible design makes it equally suitable for use on various CubeSat missions. The system was found to perform well when reading out both plastic and high Z scintillators using a total of 1.8~W. The space qualified design furthermore relies on commercial off-the-shelf components, thereby also removing most international export issues. In this paper, we will present the overall design, the performance of the electronics, its performance when reading out various scintillators and the successful space-qualification of this design.","['Merlin Kole', 'Nicolas De Angelis', 'Nicolas Produit', 'Franck Cadoux', 'Yannick Favre', 'Jochen Greiner', 'Johannes Hulsman', 'Sebastian Kusyk', 'Hancheng Li', 'Dominik Rybka', 'Jerome Stauffer', 'Adrien Stil', 'Jianchao Sun', 'Jan Swakon', 'Damian Wrobel', 'Xin Wu']",16.0,24.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07758,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,"['X-rays', 'Scintillators', 'Polarization', 'Gamma-rays', 'Space Qualification 1', 'Spectrometry']",2025-01-15
Cosmological Constraints using the Void Size Function Data from BOSS DR16,"We measure the void size function (VSF) from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR16) and perform the cosmological constraints. The BOSS DR16 galaxy sample is selected in the redshift range from $z = 0.2$ to 0.8, considering the selection criteria based on galaxy number density. We identify non-spherical voids from this galaxy catalog using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm without assuming any void shape. We select the void samples based on the void ellipticity, and derive the VSFs in two redshift bins, i.e. $z=0.2-0.5$ and $0.5-0.8$. The VSF model we use is based on the excursion-set theory, including the void linear underdensity threshold $\delta_{\rm v}$ and the redshift space distortion (RSD) parameter $\beta$. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is applied to perform the joint constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the VSF measurement from BOSS DR16 gives $w = -1.214_{-0.375}^{+0.293}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.280_{-0.047}^{+0.056}$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.874_{-0.210}^{+0.203}$, which can be a good complementary probe to galaxy clustering measurements. Our method demonstrates the potential of using the VSF to study cosmological models, and it can provide a reference for future VSF analysis in the upcoming galaxy spectroscopic surveys.","['Yingxiao Song', 'Yan Gong', 'Xingchen Zhou', 'Haitao Miao', 'Kwan Chuen Chan', 'Xuelei Chen']",5.0,11.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07817,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['Large-scale structure of the universe (902) 1', 'Cosmology(343)', 'Voids (1779)', 'Cosmological parameters (339)']",2025-01-15
The FAST Ursa Major cluster HI survey (FUMaS): catalog and HI mass function,"Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we have performed an Ursa Major cluster HI Survey (FUMaS) covering the entire UMa region centered at RA=11$^h$59$^m$28$^s$.3, DEC=49\degr05\arcmin18\arcsec with a radius of 7.5\degr. We have obtained the most complete catalog of HIsources in the UMa cluster, containing 179 HI sources with velocities in the range 625-1213.4 km~s$^{-1}$ and masses in the range 10$^{6.0}$-10$^{10.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ assuming a distance of 17.4 Mpc. Among them, 55 HI sources were detected for the first time. 32 HI sources do not have optical counterparts with known redshifts, and we found 25 possible counterparts in the multicolor optical image, and another 7 may be HI clouds. We also detected HI distributions in some interacting systems, e.g. the overlapping gas disks between NGC 3992 and its three companion galaxies, filaments around NGC 4026 and NGC 4111, and debris-like gas around NGC 3998. We computed the HIMF of the UMa cluster using the 1/V$_\mathrm{max}$ method and fitting it with the non-linear least squares (NLLS) and modified maximum likelihood (MML) method for the parameters: log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.86 $\pm$ 0.18, $\alpha$ = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.08 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.92 $\pm$ 0.23 for the NLLS method, and log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.78 $\pm$ 0.11, $\alpha$ = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.05 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.88 $\pm$ 0.14 for the MML method. This result is similar to that derived with VLA data, but the slope is steeper at the low-mass end because we detected more low-mass galaxies. The slope is flatter than that of the global HIMF, which is in agreement with the theoretical prediction that galaxies in high-density regions are stripped of gas due to interactions.","['Haiyang Yu', 'Ming Zhu', 'Chuan-Peng Zhang', 'Peng Jiang', 'Jin-Long Xu']",14.0,23.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07836,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-15
Using the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to alleviate the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ Tensions,"The $H_{0}$ tension stands as a prominent challenge in cosmology, serving as a primary driver for exploring alternative models of dark energy. Another tension arises from measurements of the $ S_{8} $ parameter, which is characterize the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe. In this study, we address the alleviation of both the Hubble tension and $ S_{8} $ tension by incorporating Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We investigate two scenarios to explore the impact of this entropy on cosmological parameters. In the first scenario, utilizing modified Friedmann equations through Kaniadakis entropy, we estimate the values of $H_{0}$ and $ S_{8} $. In the subsequent scenario, we introduce the neutrino term and assess its effect on mitigating the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Our findings reveal that when considering the first scenario, the results closely align with Planck's 2018 outcomes for Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Moreover, with the inclusion of neutrinos, these tensions are alleviated to approximately 2$\sigma$, and the $ S_{8} $ value is in full agreement with the results from the KiDS and DES survey. Furthermore, we impose a constraint on the parameter $K$ in each scenario. Our analysis yields $K = 0.12\pm 0.41$ for Kaniadakis entropy without neutrinos and $K = 0.39\pm 0.4$ for the combined dataset considering Kaniadakis entropy in the presence of neutrinos. We demonstrate that the value of K may be affected by neutrino mass, which can cause energy transfer between different parts of the universe and alter the Hubble parameter value.","['Muhammad Yarahmadi', 'Amin Salehi']",11.0,17.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07860,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,The European Physical Journal C 2024,[],2025-01-15
Planetary Nebulae,"Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.","['Orsola De Marco', 'Isabel Aleman', 'Stavros Akras']",25.0,37.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07869,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Atomic Physics', 'Chemical Physics']",,,['Planetary nebulae – Preplanetary nebulae – Circumstellar matter – Stellar evolution – White dwarf stars – Stellar winds – Interstellar gas 1arXiv:2501'],2025-01-15
More Local Volume dwarf galaxy candidates,"We present the results of searching for new dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. We found 40 satellite candidates in the double-virial-radius regions of 20 Milky Way-like and LMC-like galaxies in the southern sky using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, 10 of which were known but not clearly associated with the Local Volume previously. Among the 40 satellite candidates, 8 are supposed members of the NGC6744 group and 13 are located in the vicinity of the Sombrero galaxy. Based on seven companions to the giant spiral galaxy NGC\,6744 with measured radial velocities, we estimate that the total mass of the group is $M_T = (1.88\pm0.71)\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and the total mass-to-K-luminosity ratio $M_T/L_K = (16.1\pm6.0) M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$.

High-Contrast Imaging: Hide and Seek with Exoplanets,"So far, most of the about 5700 exoplanets have been discovered mainly with radial velocity and transit methods. These techniques are sensitive to planets in close orbits, not being able to probe large star--planet separations. $\mu$-lensing is the indirect method that allows us to probe the planetary systems at the snow-line and beyond, but it is not a repeatable observation. On the contrary, direct imaging (DI) allows for the detection and characterization of low mass companions at wide separation (\mbox{$\leq$ 5--6 au}). The main challenge of DI is that a typical planet--star contrast ranges from $10^{-6}$, for a young Jupiter in emitted light, to $10^{-9}$ for Earth in reflected light. In the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to combining large (D $\geq$ 5 m) telescopes (to reduce the impact of diffraction) with coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics (to correct phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence), with sophisticated image post-processing, to reach such a contrast between the star and the planet in order to detect and characterize cooler and closer companions to nearby stars. Building on the first pioneering instrumentation, the second generation of high-contrast imagers, SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO, allowed us to probe hundreds of stars (e.g., 500--600 stars using SHINE and GPIES), contributing to a better understanding of the demography and the occurrence of planetary systems. The DI offers a possible clear vision for studying the formation and physical properties of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs, and the future DI (space and ground-based) instruments with deeper detection limits will enhance this vision. In this paper, we briefly review the methods, the instruments, the main sample of targeted stars, the remarkable results, and the perspective of this rising technique.","['Riccardo Claudi', 'Dino Mesa']",12.0,52.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07976,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics'],,,['extrasolar planets'],2025-01-15
Mapping reionization bubbles in the JWST era II: inferring the position and characteristic size of individual bubbles,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII ""bubbles"" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly$\alpha$ spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly$\alpha$ emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, $\sim$ 0.006 $\unicode{x2013}$ 0.01 galaxies per cMpc$^3$, are required to be $\gtrsim$95\% confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within $\sim$ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at $z\sim7\unicode{x2013}8$ in $\sim$2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm min}\lesssim$ -19 $\unicode{x2013}$ -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.","['Ivan Nikolić', 'Andrei Mesinger', 'Charlotte A.

"Easy remote observations using web interfaces: controlling an Italian telescope from Japan, and more","Remote observations are often limited by user interfaces, which seem frozen to another computer era: low performances, outdated programming languages, command-line scripting, high version-dependent software. Instead, web-based tools are standard: using nothing more than a browser, astronomers can interact with a generic observatory in a native cross-platform, remote-born way. We used this approach while advancing in the remotization of the 1m-class OARPAF telescope, located in Northern Italy. The web-based control software provides easy and integrated management of its components.

Periodic Gamma-ray Modulation of the blazar PG 1553+113 Confirmed by Fermi-LAT and Multi-wavelength Observations,"A 2.1-year periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in almost 7 year of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 years of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4 sigma against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.","['S.

Improving Our Knowledge of the Solar Near-Surface Shear Layer: The Special Case of the Leptocline,"The discovery of the solar activity cycle was linked from the outset to the observation of the temporal variability of sunspots, which we know to be the result of complex processes associated with the dynamics of inner layers. Numerous recent studies have highlighted changes in the Sun's Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL), pointing to the role of the leptocline, a shallow and sharp rotational shear layer in the top around 8 Mm. The leptocline, mainly characterized by a strong radial rotational gradient at middle latitudes and self-organized meridional flows, is the cradle of numerous phenomena: opacity, superadiabaticity, and turbulent pressure changes; the hydrogen and helium ionization processes; a sharp decrease in the sound speed; and, probably, variations of the seismic radius associated with a nonmonotonic expansion of subsurface layers with depth. In addition, the leptocline may play a key role in forming the magnetic butterfly diagram. Such results are a starting point for further systematic investigations of the structure and dynamics of this layer, which will lead to a better understanding of solar activity.","['Jean-Pierre Rozelot', 'Alexander Kosovichev', 'Irina Kitiashvili']",6.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08021,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,"Astronomy in Focus, XXXIInd IAU General Assembly, August 2024 Proceedings",[],2025-01-15

All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method.

Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments,"After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.","['Andrea Pavan', 'Riccardo Ciolfi', 'Emma Dreas', 'Jay V.

Spectroscopic study of the late B-type eclipsing binary system AR Aurigae A and B: Towards clarifying the differences in atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances,"AR Aur A+B is a close binary of astrophysical interest, because dissimilar surface compositions are reported between similar late B-type dwarfs. A new spectroscopic study on this system was carried out based on the disentangled spectra, in order to determine their atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances, The effective temperature and microturbulence (determined from the equivalent widths of Fe II lines) turned out (11150K, 0.9km/s) and (10650K, 0.1km/s) for A and B. The chemical abundances of 28 elements were derived while taking into account the non-LTE effect for Z<=15 elements (Z: atomic number). The following trends were elucidated for [X/H] (abundance of X relative to the Sun): (1) Qualitatively, [X/H] shows a rough global tendency of increasing with Z, with the gradient steeper for A than for B. (2) However, considerable dispersion is involved for A, since prominently large peculiarities are seen in specific elements reflecting the characteristics of HgMn stars (e.g., very deficient N, Al, Sc, Ni; markedly overabundant P, Mn). (3) In contrast, the Z-dependence of [X/H] for B tends to be nearly linear with only a small dispersion. These observational facts may serve as a key to understanding the critical condition for the emergence of chemical anomaly.",['Yoichi Takeda'],8.0,16.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08054,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics,,['stars: abundances – stars: atmospheres – stars: binaries: spectroscopic – stars: chemically peculiar – stars: early-type – stars: individual (AR Aur)arXiv:2501'],2025-01-15
"Probing Spectral Evolution and Intrinsic Variability of Mkn\,421: A Multi-Epoch AstroSat Study of X-ray Spectra","Our study presents a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of Mkn 421, using AstroSat observations taken during different epochs between 2016 and 2019. The variability of the source in X-rays is utilized to investigate the evolution of its spectral properties. Each observation period was divided into segments of about 10 ks, and we employed three forms of particle distributions: broken-power law (BPL), log-parabola (LP), and power-law with maximum electron energy (xi-max model) undergoing synchrotron losses to fit the broad X-ray spectrum in each segment. We observed that all of these models provided good fits to the spectra. In the case of the broken-power law model, we investigated the relationship between normalized particle density at an energy less than the break energy and the index before the break. The results revealed an inverse correlation between the index and particle density with no time delay. Additionally, correlations between spectral parameters were used to determine the pivot energy. We observed that the pivot energy remained the same across the observations. For xi-max and LP models, we define analogous pivot energies and show that they also do not vary, indicating the model-independent nature of the result. The constant pivot energy suggests that the source's variability arises from index variations and not due to changes in the normalization. Consequently, parameters such as magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, etc., do not contribute to the source's variability. Instead, variations are primarily associated with the acceleration or escape timescales of emitted particles within the source.","['Sikandar Akbar', 'Zahir Shah', 'Ranjeev Misra', 'Naseer Iqbal', 'Javaid Tantry']",9.0,24.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08073,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['galaxies: active - BL Lacertae objects: general - BL Lacertae objects: individual: Mkn 421 - galaxies: jets X-rays: galaxies'],2025-01-15
Reflection-dominated Compton-thick AGN Candidates in the SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole Survey,"We search for reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT AGN) candidates in the Lockman Hole region using the data of SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole survey. We selected sources with anomalously hard photon indices in the $0.3 - 8.0$ keV band, untypical for type I AGN. In particular, we required that the upper end of the $90\%$ error interval did not exceed a fiducial boundary of $\Gamma=1.3$. We found 291 sources which constitute a rare subpopulation among extragalactic X-ray sources detected by eROSITA in the Lockman Hole field, $\approx 5\%$. These sources constitute the eROSITA sample of CT AGN candidates in the Lockman Hole field. We further divide the sources into three categories depending on the availability of reliable redshift and statistically significant detection of intrinsic absorption. We present two catalogues: the bright sample (37 sources) and the faint one (254). We estimate the fraction and sky density of reflection-dominated CT AGN candidates. We show examples of individual spectra and use stacking analysis to search for possible redshift evolution of their properties with redshift. We analyse combined eROSITA spectra of bright sources of different categories with a physically motivated spectral model UXCLUMPY and find them fully consistent with the fits to the about $\sim 1$ Msec XMM-Newton data for one of our reflection-dominated CT candidates, Type 2 galaxy $\text{SRGe J105348.6+573032}$.

Dynamical evolution of the open clusters with different star formation efficiencies and orbital parameters,"Open star clusters are dynamic systems whose evolution is critically influenced by initial conditions such as star formation efficiency and orbital parameters. Understanding their dissolution mechanisms provides insight into stellar population dynamical mixing in the Milky Way. We aim to investigate the dynamical evolution and dissolution of initially non-virialised open clusters by examining how different global star formation efficiencies and orbital characteristics impact the cluster longevity and structural changes. We followed the evolution of the clusters up to their dissolution time on the basis of our calculations. We compare our open cluster dynamical evolutionary models with the observed open clusters in our Galaxy's solar vicinity. Using high-order direct N-body simulations, we modelled cluster evolution across different Galactic orbits, systematically varying initial star formation efficiencies to comprehensively explore dissolution mechanisms. Our simulations reveal that open clusters typically survive approximately ten orbital periods, with cluster lifetime being strongly dependent on global star formation efficiency and only marginally influenced by orbital eccentricity. We estimate gas expulsion timescales of 0.9 Myr, with initial supernova explosions efficiently removing gaseous components from the cluster. The expected lifetime of the cluster (in units of orbital periods) strongly depends on the cluster global star-formation efficiency and only slightly on the orbital eccentricities of the cluster. The theoretical models demonstrate a remarkable agreement of the Roche-volobe filling parameter with the recent observed Gaia DR3 cluster catalogues in the solar vicinity. By incorporating a mixed sample of clusters with varying star formation efficiencies, we provide a more nuanced understanding of open cluster evolution in the Galactic disc.","['M. Ishchenko', 'V.

The effect of environment on the mass assembly history of the Milky Way and M31,"We study the mass growth histories of the halos of Milky Way and M31 analogues formed in constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group. These simulations constitute a fair and representative set of $\Lambda$CDM realisations conditioned on properties of the main Local Group galaxies, such as their masses, relative separation, dynamics and environment. Comparing with isolated analogues extracted from the TNG dark-matter-only simulations, we find that while our M31 halos have a comparable mass growth history to their isolated counterparts, our Milky Ways typically form earlier and their growth is suppressed at late times. Mass growth associated to major and minor mergers is also biased early for the Milky Way in comparison to M31, with most accretion occurring 1 - 4 Gyr after the Big Bang, and a relatively quiescent history at later times. 32% of our Milky Ways experienced a Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES)-like merger, while 13% host an LMC-like object at the present day, with 5% having both. In one case, an SMC- and a Sagittarius-analogue are also present, showing that the most important mergers of the Milky Way in its Local Group environment can be reproduced in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the material that makes up the Milky Way and M31 halos at the present day first collapsed onto a plane roughly aligned with the Local Sheet and Supergalactic plane; after $z \sim 2$, accretion occurred mostly within this plane, with the tidal effects of the heavier companion, M31, significantly impacting the late growth history of the Milky Way.","['Ewoud Wempe', 'Amina Helmi', 'Simon D.M.

"Global 3-D Simulations of Magnetospheric Accretion: II. Hot Spots, Equilibrium Torque, Episodic Wind, and Midplane Outflow","Global 3-D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have been conducted to study magnetospheric accretion around stars with various spin rates. For slow rotators, characterized by a fastness parameter $\omega_s\lesssim 0.78$, the disk's inner edge at the magnetospheric truncation radius becomes unstable to the interchange instability, leading to intruding filaments which produce hot spots closer to the stellar equator. Depending on spin rate, slow rotators can be in ``chaotic'' or ``ordered'' unstable regimes. For fast rotators, the interchange instability is suppressed by the super-Keplerian rotation beyond the corotation radius, and hot spots are generated only through polar accretion. Low- and mid-energy flux hot spots cover $\lesssim20\%$ and $\lesssim3\%$ of the surface, with faster rotators tending to produce hotter spots. Beyond the truncation radius, angular momentum transfers from the disk surface to the midplane, resulting in surface accretion and midplane outflow. The midplane outflow may transport thermally processed materials (e.g. those in chondrites) to the outer disk. Field inflation generates episodic winds with mass-loss rates $\sim 1\%-40\%$ of the accretion rate, depending on stellar spin. Frequent magnetic reconnections lead to efficient star-disk coupling. We derive the torque exerted by the disk on the star as a function of stellar spin. For fast rotators/propellers, both spin-down torque and disk wind rate increase dramatically with stellar spin. The equilibrium spin state occurs at $\omega_s\sim0.7$, with wind/jet speeds ($\sim$500 km/s) and mass loss rates ($\sim10\%$ accretion rate) aligning with observations. Most results are insensitive to disk thickness. Finally, we present testable predictions for how observables vary with stellar spin.",['Zhaohuan Zhu'],23.0,32.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08112,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,"['accretion disks - dynamo - magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) - instabilities - X-rays: binaries - protoplanetary disks 1', 'accretion']",2025-01-15
Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397,"We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.","['A.

Magnetic Field Structures In and Around Seyfert Galaxy Outflows,"We present radio polarimetric images of 12 Seyfert and Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER) galaxies belonging to the Centre for Astrophysics (CfA)+12 micron sample exhibiting kiloparsec-scale radio outflows (KSRs). These observations have been carried out at 10 GHz with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D-array and at 1.4 GHz with the BnA$\rightarrow$A array configurations. We find signatures of organized magnetic (B-) field structures in the cores, jets and lobes of these galaxies. The linear polarization fraction varies from a few per cent in the cores to $47\pm18$ per cent in the lobes. The inferred B-fields are toroidal in the cores of several sources making them consistent with the presence of either a sheath-like or a wind-like component surrounding the jet. The in-band spectral index images typically show the presence of flat/inverted spectrum cores and steep spectrum lobes. Radio cores with flatter spectra are found to have lower Eddington ratios while the steeper ones have higher. A strong correlation is observed between the Seyfert/LINER radio outflow properties and the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs); correlations with Eddington ratios are weaker. We find signatures of jet-medium interaction and both positive and negative AGN feedback in these sources. Overall, our study indicates that radio-quiet (RQ) AGN with KSRs possess radio outflows driven by magnetic fields anchored to their black holes - accretion disks, which significantly impact their environments.","['Salmoli Ghosh', 'P.

Farside helioseismology with Sun-as-a-star data: the solar cycle as seen with 7-day-long BiSON timeseries,"We present results from fitting $p$-mode spectra derived from 7-d segments of Sun-as-a-star helioseismic observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network covering 32 yr. The results show a clear dependence of the mode frequencies on solar activity, and the frequency dependence of the sensitivity to activity can also be seen. Because we use data segments that cover less than half of a solar rotation, we are able to test for the effect of activity on the solar far side. By fitting with a model that takes into account activity on the far side of the Sun, we show that the frequency shifts are sensitive to activity from the whole Sun, not just the side facing the observer. Our results suggest that there is potential to investigate activity-related asteroseismic frequency shifts in solar-like oscillators using short time series of observations.","['R. Howe', 'W.J.

Architecture Classification for Extrasolar Planetary Systems,"This paper presents a classification framework for the architectures of planetary systems based on a complete survey of the confirmed exoplanet population. With nearly 6000 confirmed exoplanets discovered, including more than 300 multiplanet systems with three or more planets, the current observational sample has reached the point where it is both feasible and useful to build a classification system that divides the observed population into meaningful categories. This framework provides a criterion to split planetary systems into inner and outer regimes, and then further divides inner systems into dynamical classes. The resulting categories include ""peas-in-a-pod systems"" with uniformly small planets and ""warm Jupiter systems"" with a mix of large and small planets, as well as ""closely-spaced systems"" and ""gapped systems,"" with further subdivisions based on the locations of gaps and other features. These categories can classify nearly all of the confirmed systems with three or more planets with minimal ambiguity. We qualitatively examine the relative prevalence of each type of system, subject to observational selection effects, as well as other notable features such as the presence of hot Jupiters. A small number of outlier systems are also discussed. Potential additional classes of systems yet to be discovered are proposed.","['Alex R. Howe', 'Juliette C. Becker', 'Christopher C.

The VMC Survey : LI. Classifying extragalactic sources using a probabilistic random forest supervised machine learning algorithm,"We used a supervised machine learning algorithm (probabilistic random forest) to classify ~130 million sources in the VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC). We used multi-wavelength photometry from optical to far-infrared as features to be trained on, and spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), galaxies and a range of stellar classes including from new observations with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and SAAO 1.9m telescope. We also retain a label for sources that remain unknown. This yielded average classifier accuracies of ~79% (SMC) and ~87% (LMC). Restricting to the 56,696,719 sources with class probabilities (P$_{class}$) > 80% yields accuracies of ~90% (SMC) and ~98% (LMC). After removing sources classed as 'Unknown', we classify a total of 707,939 (SMC) and 397,899 (LMC) sources, including > 77,600 extragalactic sources behind the Magellanic Clouds. The extragalactic sources are distributed evenly across the field, whereas the Magellanic sources concentrate at the centres of the Clouds, and both concentrate in optical/IR colour-colour/magnitude diagrams as expected.

Here, we report on 26 new Galactic radio transients, mostly rotating radio transients (RRATs) and also the detection of one RRAT and two pulsars that were independently discovered by other surveys. The dispersion measures of two of the new sources marginally exceed the Galactic contribution depending on the electron density model used. Using a simple method of fitting a Gaussian function to individual pulses, and obtaining positions of arcsecond accuracy from image-based localisations using channelised voltage data from our transient buffer, we have derived timing solutions spanning multiple years for five sources. The timing parameters imply ages of several Myr and low surface magnetic field strengths which is characteristic of RRATs. We were able to measure spin periods for eight more transients, including one source which appears to rotate every 17.5 seconds. A majority of the sources have only been seen in one observation, sometimes despite multiple return visits to the field. Some sources exhibit complex emission features like component switching and periodic microstructure.","['James Dennis Turner', 'Ben W. Stappers', 'Jun Tian', 'Mechiel C.

Little impact of mergers and galaxy morphology on the production and escape of ionizing photons in the early Universe,"Compact, star-forming galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) are often efficient Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at $z\leq 4.5$, likely as intense stellar feedback creates low-density channels that allow photons to escape. Irregular or disturbed morphologies, such as those resulting from mergers, can also facilitate LyC escape by creating anisotropic gas distributions. We investigate the influence of galaxy morphology on LyC production and escape at redshifts $5 \leq z \leq 7$ using observations from various \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) surveys. Our sample consists of 436 sources, which are predominantly low-mass ($\sim 10^{8.15} M_\odot$), star-forming galaxies with ionizing photon efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) values consistent with canonical expectations. Since direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ are not possible during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), we predict $f_{\rm esc}$ for high-redshift galaxies by applying survival analysis to a subsample of LyC emitters from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), selected to be direct analogs of reionization-era galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit on average modest predicted escape fractions ($\sim 0.04$). Additionally, we assess the correlation between morphological features and LyC emission. Our findings indicate that neither $\xi_{\rm ion}$ nor the predicted $f_{\rm esc}$ values show a significant correlation with the presence of merger signatures. This suggests that in low-mass galaxies at $z \geq 5$, strong morphological disturbances are not the primary mechanism driving LyC emission and leakage. Instead, compactness and star formation activity likely play a more pivotal role in regulating LyC escape.","['S. Mascia', 'L. Pentericci', 'M. Llerena', 'A. Calabrò', 'J. Matthee', 'S. Flury', 'F.

Vertical CO surfaces as a probe for protoplanetary disk mass and carbon depletion,"As the sample of mid-inclination disks with measured CO emission surfaces grows, a fundamental unanswered question is how these vertical profiles connect to their host properties. This project aims to relate the vertical extent of protoplanetary disks as traced by $^{12}$CO $2-1$ to key stellar and physical parameters. In order to produce a result that is applicable towards an observational analysis, we benchmark our results with ALMA observations of CO emission from nineteen disks. We produce a grid of disk models using the physical-chemical code DALI, for a template T Tauri and Herbig star. Our models use an iterative solver to calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium equations and determine a physically-motivated density structure. Key stellar and disk parameters such as stellar luminosity and temperature, total disk mass, carbon abundance and critical radius are varied to determine their effect on the CO emitting surface. Each vertical profile is fitted by an exponentially tapered power-law and characterized by the $z/r$ value that represents the structure inwards of 80% of the tapering radius. The CO emission surface location is primarily determined by the disk mass ($M_d$) and the level of volatile carbon depletion. T Tauri and Herbig systems show different vertical profiles, with disks around T Tauri stars being more vertically extended. We derive a $z/r$-$M_d$ relationship, which for each stellar type has a degeneracy with the volatile carbon abundance. In order to reconcile total disk mass estimates from the characteristic $z/r$ and the values obtained based on dust continuum analysis, a volatile carbon depletion of 10-100 (with respect to the ISM) is needed for the majority of our sources. Our carbon depletion values are in agreement with previous literature estimates, highlighting the potential of this method to rapidly calculate key disk parameters.","['T. Paneque-Carreño', 'A.

A Disintegrating Rocky World Shrouded in Dust and Gas: Mid-IR Observations of K2-22b using JWST,"The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.3-11.8 $\mu$m. We detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. We find that the data 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with some gas features, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.","['Nick Tusay', 'Jason T. Wright', 'Thomas G.

Parallel Electric Fields And Electron Heating Observed In The Young Solar Wind,"The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.","['Forrest Mozer', 'Oleksiy Agapitov', 'Kyung-Eu Choi', 'Richard Sydora']",5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08311,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,"Phys.

Calibration and Applications of the All-Sky Camera at the Ali Observatory in Tibet,"A high-precision calibration method for all-sky cameras has been realized using images from the Ali observatory in Tibet, providing application results for atmospheric extinction, night sky brightness, and known variable stars. This method achieves high-precision calibration for individual all-sky images, with the calibration process introducing deviations of less than 0.5pixels. Within a 70-degree zenith angle, the calibration deviation of the images is less than 0.25pixels. Beyond this angle, the calibration deviation increases significantly due to the sparser distribution of stars. Increasing the number of stars with zenith angles greater than 70degrees used for calibration can improve the calibration accuracy for areas beyond the 70-degree zenith angle, reducing the calibration deviation at an 85-degree zenith angle to 0.2pixels. Analysis of the all-sky images indicates that the atmospheric extinction coefficient at the Ali Observatory is approximately 0.20, and the night sky background brightness is about 21 magnitudes per square arcsecond, suggesting the presence of urban light pollution.","['Jia Yin', 'Yongqiang Yao', 'Xuan Qian', 'Liyong Liu', 'Xu Chen', 'Liuming Zhai']",15.0,11.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08358,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Detectors'],MNRAS,,['Astronomy data analysis – All-sky cameras – Calibration 1 INTRODUCTION All-sky images are captured by all-sky cameras equipped wit h ﬁsheye lenses'],2025-01-16
Euclid preparation LX. The use of HST images as input for weak-lensing image simulations,"Data from the Euclid space telescope will enable cosmic shear measurements with very small statistical errors, requiring corresponding systematic error control level. A common approach to correct for shear biases involves calibrating shape measurement methods using image simulations with known input shear. Given their high resolution, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) galaxies can, in principle, be utilised to emulate Euclid observations. In this work, we employ a GalSim-based testing environment to investigate whether uncertainties in the HST point spread function (PSF) model or in data processing techniques introduce significant biases in weak-lensing (WL) shear calibration. We used single Sérsic galaxy models to simulate both HST and Euclid observations. We then `Euclidised' our HST simulations and compared the results with the directly simulated Euclid-like images. For this comparison, we utilised a moment-based shape measurement algorithm and galaxy model fits. Through the Euclidisation procedure, we effectively reduced the residual multiplicative biases in shear measurements to sub-percent levels. This achievement was made possible by employing either the native pixel scales of the instruments, utilising the Lanczos15 interpolation kernel, correcting for noise correlations, and ensuring consistent galaxy signal-to-noise ratios between simulation branches. However, the Euclidisation procedure requires further analysis on the impact of the correlated noise, to estimate calibration bias. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the accuracy of TinyTim HST PSF models using star fields observed in the F606W and F814W filters. We observe that F606W images exhibit a broader scatter in the recovered best-fit focus, compared to those in the F814W filter.","['Euclid Collaboration', 'D. Scognamiglio', 'T. Schrabback', 'M.

Habitable Worlds Formed at Cosmic Dawn,"Primordial supernovae were the first, great nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Here we show that planetesimals, the precursors of terrestrial planets, formed around low-mass stars in the debris of the first cosmic explosions 200 Myr after the Big Bang, before the first galaxies and far earlier than previously thought. A dense core in one of these explosions collapsed to a protoplanetary disk in which several Earth masses of planetesimals formed 0.46 - 1.66 AU from their parent 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ star, where equilibrium temperatures varied from 269 K to 186 K, in water mass fractions that were only a factor of a few less than in the Solar System today.

Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars,"The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or ""stripped"" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and ""Blue-Bump"" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.","['A.

Complete Hamiltonian Framework of Relativistic Hierarchical Triple Systems: Capabilities and Limitations of Secular Perturbation Theory,"Relativistic secular perturbation theory has ignited significant interest in uncovering intricate cross-term effects, especially the interplay between 1PN and quadrupole terms. While most existing studies rely on the Lagrangian planetary perturbation method for computing cross terms, a comprehensive Hamiltonian framework for the field has been missing. In this work, we introduce a framework based on von Zeipel transformation, utilizing two sequential canonical transformations to systematically compute cross terms to arbitrary orders. Our results reveal secular cross terms up to quadrupole-squared order, showcasing remarkable consistency with both the Lagrangian method [1] and the effective-field-theory approach [2]. We present leading-order periodic cross terms arising from the interactions between 1PN and quadrupole, and present estimates of higher-order cross terms. It is demonstrated that this method not only accurately predicts the long-term evolution of hierarchical systems but also captures fast oscillations observed in N-body simulations. We identify and validate resonances caused by quadrupole-squared effects, highlighting both consistencies and discrepancies when compared to N-body simulations. These discrepancies underscore the importance of mean-motion resonances, a factor overlooked in current secular perturbation frameworks. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the subtleties and limitations inherent to secular perturbation theory, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field.","['Kaye Jiale Li', 'Kinwah Wu', 'Ziri Younsi', 'Tjonnie G.F.

Measuring the intracluster light fraction with machine learning,"The intracluster light (ICL) is an important tracer of a galaxy cluster's history and past interactions. However, only small samples have been studied to date due to its very low surface brightness and the heavy manual involvement required for the majority of measurement algorithms. Upcoming large imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time are expected to vastly expand available samples of deep cluster images. However, to process this increased amount of data, we need faster, fully automated methods to streamline the measurement process. This paper presents a machine learning model designed to automatically measure the ICL fraction in large samples of images, with no manual preprocessing required. We train the fully supervised model on a training dataset of 50,000 images with injected artificial ICL profiles. We then transfer its learning onto real data by fine-tuning with a sample of 101 real clusters with their ICL fraction measured manually using the surface brightness threshold method. With this process, the model is able to effectively learn the task and then adapt its learning to real cluster images. Our model can be directly applied to Hyper Suprime-Cam images, processing up to 500 images in a matter of seconds on a single GPU, or fine-tuned for other imaging surveys such as LSST, with the fine-tuning process taking just 3 minutes. The model could also be retrained to match other ICL measurement methods. Our model and the code for training it is made available on GitHub.","['Louisa Canepa', 'Sarah Brough', 'Francois Lanusse', 'Mireia Montes', 'Nina Hatch']",9.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08378,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],ApJ,,[],2025-01-16
Particle Acceleration and Nonthermal Emission at the Intrabinary Shock of Spider Pulsars. II: Fast-Cooling Simulations,"Spider pulsars are binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. Their X-ray emission, varying with orbital phase, originates from synchrotron radiation produced by high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. For fast-spinning pulsars in compact binary systems, the intrabinary shock emission occurs in the fast cooling regime. Using global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effect of synchrotron losses on the shock structure and the resulting emission, assuming that the pulsar wind is stronger than the companion wind (so, the shock wraps around the companion), as expected in black widows. We find that the shock opening angle gets narrower for greater losses; the lightcurve shows a more prominent double-peaked signature (with two peaks just before and after the pulsar eclipse) for stronger cooling; below the cooling frequency, the synchrotron spectrum displays a hard power-law range, consistent with X-ray observations.","['Jorge Cortés', 'Lorenzo Sironi']",7.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08387,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['acceleration of particles — magnetic reconnection — radiation mechanisms: non-thermal — shock waves 1 INTRODUCTION Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisec- ond pulsar and a low-mass companion—either a non-degenerate star with mass∼0'],2025-01-16
Phasing the Giant Magellan Telescope: Lab Experiments and First On-sky Demonstration,"The large apertures of the upcoming generation of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will enable unprecedented angular resolutions that scale as $\propto$ $\lambda$/D and higher sensitivities that scale as $D^4$ for point sources corrected by adaptive optics. However, all will have pupil segmentation caused by mechanical struts holding up the secondary mirror [European Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope] or intrinsically, by design, as in the Giant Magellan Telescope. These gaps will be separated by more than a typical atmospheric coherence length (Fried Parameter). The pupil fragmentation at scales larger than the typical atmospheric coherence length, combined with wavefront sensors with weak or ambiguous sensitivity to differential piston, can introduce differential piston areas of the wavefront known as ""petal modes"". Commonly used wavefront sensors, such as a pyramid WFS, also struggle with phase wrapping caused by >$\lambda$/2 differential piston WFE. We have developed the holographic dispersed fringe sensor, a single pupil-plane optic that employs holography to interfere the dispersed light from each segment onto different spatial locations in the focal plane to sense and correct differential piston between the segments. This allows for a very high and linear dynamic piston sensing range of approximately $\pm$10 $\mu$m. We have begun the initial attempts at phasing a segmented pupil utilizing the HDFS on the High Contrast Adaptive optics phasing Testbed and the Extreme Magellan Adaptive Optics instrument (MagAO-X) at the University of Arizona. Additionally, we have demonstrated use of the HDFS as a differential piston sensor on-sky for the first time. We were able to phase each segment to within $\pm\lambda$/11.3 residual piston WFE ($\lambda$ = 800 nm) of a reference segment and achieved ~50 nm RMS residual piston WFE across the aperture in poor seeing conditions.","['Maggie Y.

PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 II: radio analysis of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics,"We report upgraded Giant Metrewave radio telescope and Karl J. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations of a low-mass merging galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. This exceptional galaxy cluster hosts two megaparsec-scale diffuse sources, symmetrically located with respect to the cluster center and separated by about 2.6 Mpc. We detect these low surface brightness sources in our new high-frequency observations (0.3-2 GHz) and classify them as radio relics associated with merger-driven shock fronts. The southwest relic exhibits an inverted morphology and shows evidence of spectral steepening in the post-shock region, potentially tracing a high Mach number shock ($\sim 4$) under the framework of diffusive shock acceleration. The northeast relic is found to be highly polarized with a 22% average polarization fraction at 1.5 GHz and aligned magnetic field vectors. Its spectral and polarization properties, along with the presence of a nearby tailed galaxy, support re-acceleration scenarios. The merger axis defined by the two relics is tilted by $\sim 45$ degree with respect to the plane of the sky, which implies an unprecedented projected separation of $\sim 3.5$ Mpc. We also detect a possible faint radio halo, suggesting weak turbulence in the central cluster region. We conclude that the faint double relics can be best explained by two outward moving shock waves in which particles are (re-)accelerated and that the cluster is in an evolved merger state.

Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet,"Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.","['Forrest Mozer', 'Andrii Voshchepynets', 'Oleksiy Agapitov', 'Kyung-Eu Choi', 'Richard Sydora']",4.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08419,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,[],2025-01-16
The Impact of Extended CO$_2$ Cross Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres,"Our interpretation of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric spectra will always be limited by the accuracy of the data we use as input in our forward and retrieval models. Ultraviolet molecular absorption cross sections are one category of these essential model inputs; however, they are often poorly characterized at the longest wavelengths relevant to photo-dissociation. Photolysis reactions dominate the chemical kinetics of temperate terrestrial planet atmospheres. One molecule of particular importance is CO$_2$, which is likely present in all terrestrial planet atmospheres. The photolysis of CO$_2$ can introduce CO and O, as well as shield tropospheric water vapor from undergoing photolysis. This is important because H$_2$O photolysis produces OH, which serves as a major reactive sink to many atmospheric trace gases. Here, we construct CO$_2$ cross-section prescriptions at 195K and 300K extrapolated beyond 200 nm from measured cross sections. We compare results from the implementation of these new cross sections to the most commonly used CO$_2$ prescriptions for temperate, terrestrial planets with Archean-like atmospheres. We generally find that the observational consequences of CO$_2$ dissociation beyond 200 nm is minimal so long as our least conservative (highest opacity) prescription can be ruled out. Moreover, implementing our recommended extended CO$_2$ cross sections does not substantially alter previous results showing the consequential photochemical impact of extended H$_2$O cross sections.","['Wynter Broussard', 'Edward W.

Deep high-resolution L band spectroscopy in the $\beta$ Pictoris planetary system,"The beta Pictoris system, with its two directly imaged planets beta Pic b and beta Pic c and its well characterised debris disk, is a prime target for detailed characterisation of young planetary systems. Here, we present high-resolution and high-contrast LM band spectroscopy with CRIRES+ of the system, primarily for the purpose of atmospheric characterisation of beta Pic b. We developed methods for determining slit geometry and wavelength calibration based on telluric absorption and emission lines, as well as methods for PSF modelling and subtraction, and artificial planet injection, in order to extract and characterise planet spectra at a high S/N and spectral fidelity. Through cross-correlation with model spectra, we detected H2O absorption for planet b in each of the 13 individual observations spanning four different spectral settings. This provides a clear confirmation of previously detected water absorption, and allowed us to derive an exquisite precision on the rotational velocity of beta Pic b, v_rot = 20.36 +/- 0.31 km/s, which is consistent within error bars with previous determinations. We also observed a tentative H2O cross-correlation peak at the expected position and velocity of planet c; the feature is however not at a statistically significant level. Despite a higher sensitivity to SiO than earlier studies, we do not confirm a tentative SiO feature previously reported for planet b. When combining data from different epochs and different observing modes for the strong H2O feature of planet b, we find that the S/N grows considerably faster when sets of different spectral settings are combined, compared to when multiple data sets of the same spectral setting are combined. This implies that maximising spectral coverage is often more important than maximising integration depth when investigating exoplanetary atmospheres using cross-correlation techniques.","['Markus Janson', 'Jonas Wehrung-Montpezat', 'Ansgar Wehrhahn', 'Alexis Brandeker', 'Gayathri Viswanath', 'Paul Molliere', 'Thomas Stolker']",9.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08445,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['Planets and satellites: atmospheres – Planetary systems – Techniques: spectroscopic 1'],2025-01-16
The MAGPI Survey: the subtle role of environment and not-so-subtle impact of generations of stars on galaxy dynamics,"The stellar age and mass of galaxies have been suggested as the primary determinants for the dynamical state of galaxies, with environment seemingly playing no or only a very minor role. We use a sample of 77 galaxies at intermediate redshift (z~0.3) in the Middle-Ages Galaxies Properties with Integral field spectroscopy (MAGPI) Survey to study the subtle impact of environment on galaxy dynamics. We use a combination of statistical techniques (simple and partial correlations and principal component analysis) to isolate the contribution of environment on galaxy dynamics, while explicitly accounting for known factors such as stellar age, star formation histories and stellar masses. We consider these dynamical parameters: high-order kinematics of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (parametrised by the Gauss-Hermite coefficients $h_3$ and $h_4$), kinematic asymmetries $V_{\rm asym}$ derived using kinemetry and the observational spin parameter proxy $\lambda_{R_e}$. Of these, the mean $h_4$ is the only parameter found to have a significant correlation with environment as parametrised by group dynamical mass. This correlation exists even after accounting for age and stellar mass trends. Finally, we confirm that variations in the spin parameter $\lambda_{R_e}$ are most strongly (anti-)correlated with age as seen in local studies, and show that this dependence is well-established by z~0.3.","['Caroline Foster', 'Sabine Bellstedt', 'Francesco DEugenio', 'Adriano Poci', 'Ryan Bagge', 'Katherine Harborne', 'Thomas Venville', 'J.

Kinetic and photochemical disequilibrium in the potentially carbon-rich atmosphere of the warm-Jupiter WASP-69b,"High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas-giant WASP-69b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize non-equilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O=2 best match observations, but models with C/O=0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits towards carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.","['Nidhi Bangera', 'Christiane Helling', 'Gloria Guilluy', 'Patricio Cubillos', 'Luca Fossati', 'Paolo Giacobbe', 'Paul Rimmer', 'Daniel Kitzmann']",11.0,22.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08463,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Exoplanet atmospheres (487) — Planetary atmospheres (1244) — 1'],2025-01-16
An Updated Detection Pipeline for Precursor Emission in Type II Supernova 2020tlf,"We present a new photometric pipeline for the detection of pre-supernova (pre-SN) emission in the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) sky survey. The method described is applied to SN 2020tlf, a type II SN (SN II) with precursor emission in the last ~100 days before first light. We re-analyze the YSE griz-band light curves of SN 2020tlf and provide revised pre-explosion photometry that includes a robust list of confident detection and limiting magnitudes. Compared to the results of Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a, this new analysis yields fewer total r/i/z-band pre-SN detections at phases > -100 days. Furthermore, we discourage the use of the blackbody modeling of the pre-explosion spectral energy distribution, the pre-SN bolometric light curve and the blackbody model parameters presented in Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a. Nevertheless, binned photometry of SN 2020tlf confirms a consistent progenitor luminosity of ~10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before explosion.","['Wynn Jacobson-Galán', 'Sebastian Gonzalez', 'Shreyas Patel', 'Luc Dessart', 'David Jones', 'Deanne Coppejans', 'Georgios Dimitriadis', 'Ryan J.

The NEMESIS Catalogue of Young Stellar Objects for the Orion Star Formation Complex. I. General description of data curation,"The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.","['J.

Cosmological distance forecasts for the CSST Galaxy Survey using BAO peaks,"The measurement of cosmological distances using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) is crucial for studying the universe's expansion. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) galaxy redshift survey, with its vast volume and sky coverage, provides an opportunity to address key challenges in cosmology. However, redshift uncertainties in galaxy surveys can degrade both angular and radial distance estimates. In this study, we forecast the precision of BAO distance measurements using mock CSST galaxy samples, applying a two-point correlation function (2PCF) wedge approach to mitigate redshift errors. We simulate redshift uncertainties of $\sigma_0 = 0.003$ and $\sigma_0 = 0.006$, representative of expected CSST errors, and examine their effects on the BAO peak and distance scaling factors, $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_\parallel$, across redshift bins within $0.0 < z \leqslant 1.0$. The wedge 2PCF method proves more effective in detecting the BAO peak compared to the monopole 2PCF, particularly for $\sigma_0 = 0.006$. Constraints on the BAO peaks show that $\alpha_\perp$ is well constrained around 1.0, regardless of $\sigma_0$, with precision between 1% and 3% across redshift bins. In contrast, $\alpha_\parallel$ measurements are more sensitive to increases in $\sigma_0$. For $\sigma_0 = 0.003$, the results remain close to the fiducial value, with uncertainties ranging between 4% and 9%; for $\sigma_0 = 0.006$, significant deviations from the fiducial value are observed. We also study the ability to measure parameters $(\Omega_m, H_0r_\mathrm{d})$ using distance measurements, proving robust constraints as a cosmological probe under CSST-like redshift uncertainties.","['Feng Shi', 'Jieyi Tian', 'Zhejie Ding', 'Xiaohu Yang', 'Yizhou Gu', 'Christoph Saulder', 'Xiaoping Li', 'Yanming Liu', 'Zitong Wang', 'Hu Zhan', 'Ming Li', 'Xiaolei Li', 'Hong Guo', 'Yan Gong', 'Yunkun Han', 'Cheng Li', 'Yipeng Jing', 'Jipeng Sui', 'Run Wen', 'Gong-Bo Zhao', 'Hu Zou', 'Pengjie Zhang', 'Xianzhong Zheng', 'Xingchen Zhou']",12.0,16.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08503,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-16
Exploring the spatially resolved initial mass function in SAMI star-forming galaxies,"The initial mass function (IMF) is a construct that describes the distribution of stellar masses for a newly formed population of stars. It is a fundamental element underlying all of star and galaxy formation, and has been the subject of extensive investigation for more than 60 years. In the past few decades there has been a growing, and now substantial, body of evidence supporting the need for a variable IMF. In this light, it is crucial to investigate the IMF's characteristics across different spatial scales and to understand the factors driving its variability. We make use of spatially resolved spectroscopy to examine the high-mass IMF slope of star-forming galaxies within the SAMI survey. By applying the Kennicutt method and stellar population synthesis models, we estimated both the spaxel-resolved ($\alpha_{res}$) and galaxy-integrated ($\alpha_{int}$) high-mass IMF slopes of these galaxies. Our findings indicate that the resolved and integrated IMF slopes exhibit a near 1:1 relationship for $\alpha_{int}> -2.7$. We observe a wide range of $\alpha_{res}$ distributions within galaxies. To explore the sources of this variability, we analyse the relationships between the resolved and integrated IMF slopes and both the star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$). Our results reveal a strong correlation where flatter/steeper slopes are associated with higher/lower SFR and $\Sigma_{SFR}$. This trend is qualitatively similar for resolved and global scales. Additionally, we identify a mass dependency in the relationship with SFR, though none was found in the relation between the resolved slope and $\Sigma_{SFR}$. These findings suggest an scenario where the formation of high-mass stars is favoured in regions with more concentrated star formation. This may be a consequence of the reduced fragmentation of molecular clouds, which nonetheless accrete more material.","['Diego Salvador', 'Andrew Hopkins', 'Matt Owers', 'Themiya Nanayakkara', 'Scott Croom']",13.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08510,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-16
Photometric light curve studies: potential bias induced by exposure time,"In photometric observations, the flux averaged over the preset exposure time is usually used as the representation of an object's true flux at the middle of the exposure interval. For the study of transients and variables, it is also the default manner to build the light curves. In this work, we investigate the effect of this common practice on quantifying the photometric light curves. Our analysis shows that the flux averaged over the exposure time is not necessarily identical to the true flux so that potential bias may be introduced. The overall profile of the true light curve tends to be flattened by the exposure time. In addition, it is found that the peak position and photometric color can also be altered. We then discuss the impacts of the bias induced by exposure time on the light curves of stellar flares, periodic stars, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The bias can lead to an underestimate of the total fluxes of stellar flares which has been noticed in the observational data. For periodic stars that follow a sinusoidal light curve, the bias does not affect the period and peak position, but can result in the peak flux being underestimated. Meanwhile, the bias can result in steeper structure function at short timescales for AGN light curves. To obtain unbiased physical parameter estimates from the light curves, our analysis indicates that it is essential to account for this bias, particularly for transients and variables with very short timescales.","['Dezi Liu', 'Zuhui Fan']",6.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08517,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['often manifesting as variations in brightness or dramatic explosions over different timescales', 'methods: miscellaneous – stars: variables: general – stars: flare 1 INTRODUCTION Many astronomical objects in the Universe exhibit a variety of dy- namic phenomena']",2025-01-16
Deep inference of simulated strong lenses in ground-based surveys,"The large number of strong lenses discoverable in future astronomical surveys will likely enhance the value of strong gravitational lensing as a cosmic probe of dark energy and dark matter. However, leveraging the increased statistical power of such large samples will require further development of automated lens modeling techniques. We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $<$10\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model. This work takes important steps in the systematic comparison of methods for different levels of model complexity.","['Jason Poh', 'Ashwin Samudre', 'Aleksandra Ćiprijanović', 'Joshua Frieman', 'Gourav Khullar', 'Brian D.

Cold Gas and Star Formation in the Phoenix Cluster with JWST,"We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner $\sim$50 kpc of the cluster. We have developed a novel method for measuring the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H$_2$ line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of $2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$, which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.9 \pm 0.2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}\,({\rm K}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}$; an updated stellar mass of $M_* = 2.6 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 10} = 1340 \pm 100$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 100} = 740 \pm 80$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively. The H$_2$ emission seems to be powered predominantly by star formation within the central $\sim 20$ kpc, with no need for an extra particle heating component as is seen in other BCGs. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.","['Michael Reefe', 'Michael McDonald', 'Marios Chatzikos', 'Jerome Seebeck', 'Richard Mushotzky', 'Sylvain Veilleux', 'Steven Allen', 'Matthew Bayliss', 'Michael Calzadilla', 'Rebecca Canning', 'Megan Donahue', 'Benjamin Floyd', 'Massimo Gaspari', 'Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo', 'Brian McNamara', 'Helen Russell', 'Arnab Sarkar', 'Keren Sharon', 'Taweewat Somboonpanyakul']",13.0,21.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08527,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,['Galaxy clusters (584) — Infrared astronomy(786) — Cooling flows (2028) — Active galaxies (17) — Elliptical galaxies (456) — Starburst galaxies (1570) Corresponding author: Michael Reefe mreefe@mit'],2025-01-16

The spectroscopic data were obtained from two different sources: the P200/DBSP in California and publicly available datasets, including SDSS and DESI-EDR. The two lensed quasars (both pairs) have the following properties: $\theta_E$ = 1.208'', $z_s$ = 3.105; $\theta_E$ = 0.749, $z_s$ = 2.395.

The eleven projected quasars have projected separations ranging from 10.96 to 39.07 kpc, with a mean separation of 22.64 kpc. Additionally, there are three likely lensed quasars that cannot be definitively confirmed, contributed by two reasons. Firstly, their image separations (0.83'', 0.98'', and 0.93'') are small compared to the seeing conditions during our observations (around 1.2''). Secondly, no high SNR lensing galaxy can be detected in the Legacy Survey Imaging.

Broad primordial power spectrum and $\mu$-distortion constraints on primordial black holes,"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) might originate from supermassive primordial black holes (PBHs). However, the hypothesis that these PBHs formed through the enhancement of the primordial curvature perturbations has consistently faced significant challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by $\mu$-distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on $\mu$-distortion constraint in the context of broad power spectra. Our results show that, under the assumption of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations, a broad power spectrum may lead to weaker $\mu$-distortion constraints compared to the Gaussian cases. Our findings highlight the potential of the broad power spectrum to alleviate the $\mu$-distortion constraints on supermassive PBHs under large non-Gaussianity.","['Zhan-He Wang', 'Hai-Long Huang', 'Yun-Song Piao']",7.0,24.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08542,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-16
Unveiling the kinematics of a central region in the triple AGN host NGC 7733-7734 interacting group,"We present a detailed study of the interacting triple active galactic nuclear system NGC 7733-34, focusing on stellar kinematics, ionised gas characteristics and star formation within the central region and stellar bars of both galaxies. We performed a comprehensive analysis using archival data from MUSE, HST/ACS, and DECaLS, complemented by observations from UVIT and IRSF. We identified a disc-like bulge in both NGC 7733 and NGC 7734 through 2-D decomposition. A central nuclear structure, with a semi-major axis of $\sim$1.113 kpc, was detected in NGC 7733 via photometric and kinematic analysis, confirmed by the strong anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$, indicative of circular orbits in the centre. NGC 7734 lacks a distinct nuclear structure. The presence of disc-like bulge results in an anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$ along with diffuse light. However, it does show higher central velocity dispersion, possibly attributed to an interaction with a smaller clump, which is likely a fourth galaxy within the system. Both galaxies demonstrate ongoing star formation, evidenced by $FUV$ and $H\alpha$ observations. NGC 7734 shows recent star formation along its bar, while NGC 7733 experiences bar quenching. The star formation rate (SFR) analysis of NGC 7734 reveals that the bar region's SFR dominates the galaxy's overall SFR. Conversely, in NGC 7733, the lack of star formation along the bar and the presence of a Seyfert 2 active galactic nuclei at the galaxy centre leave the possibility of a connection between both facts. However, it does not affect the galaxy's overall star formation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stellar and gas kinematics, star formation processes, and active galactic nuclear feedback mechanisms in interacting galaxies hosting stellar bars.","['Saili Keshri', 'Sudhanshu Barway', 'Mousumi Das', 'Jyoti Yadav', 'Francoise Combes']",11.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08544,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: interaction - galaxies: active - galaxies: interacting - galaxies: individual: NGC 7733 – galaxies: individual: NGC 7734 - techniques: imaging spectroscopy 1'],2025-01-16

ODIN: Star Formation Histories Reveal Formative Starbursts Experienced by Lyman Alpha Emitting Galaxies at Cosmic Noon,"In this work, we test the conventional assumption that Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are experiencing their first major burst of star formation at the time of observation. To this end, we identify 74 LAEs from the ODIN Survey with rest-UV-through-NIR photometry from UVCANDELS. For each LAE, we perform non-parametric star formation history (SFH) reconstruction using the Dense Basis Gaussian process-based method of spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that a strong majority (67%) of our LAE SFHs align with the conventional archetype of a first major star formation burst, with at most modest star formation rates (SFRs) in the past. However, the rest of our LAE SFHs have significant amounts of star formation in the past, with 28% exhibiting earlier bursts of star formation with the ongoing burst having the highest SFR (dominant bursts), and the final 5% having experienced their highest SFR in the past (non-dominant bursts). Combining the SFHs indicating first and dominant bursts, 95% of LAEs are experiencing their largest burst yet -- a formative burst. This suggests that LAEs have more complicated stellar mass assembly than expected. We also find that the fraction of total stellar mass created in the last 200 Myr is ~1.33 times higher in LAEs than in control Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples, and that a majority of LBGs are experiencing dominant bursts, reaffirming that LAEs differ from other star forming galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that multiple evolutionary paths can produce galaxies with strong observed Ly$\alpha$ emission.","['Nicole M. Firestone', 'Eric Gawiser', 'Kartheik G.

Gamma-ray flares from the jet of the blazar CTA 102 in 2016-2018,"CTA 102 is a $\gamma$-ray bright blazar that exhibited multiple flares in observations by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope during the period of 2016-2018. We present results from the analysis of multi-wavelength light curves aiming at revealing the nature of $\gamma$-ray flares from the relativistic jet in the blazar. We analyse radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data obtained in a period from 2012 September 29 to 2018 October 8. We identify six flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve, showing a harder-when-brighter-trend in the $\gamma$-ray spectra. We perform a cross-correlation analysis of the multi-wavelength light curves. We find nearly zero time lags between the $\gamma$-ray and optical and X-ray light curves, implying a common spatial origin for the emission in these bands. We find significant correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves as well as negative/positive time lags with the $\gamma$-ray emission lagging/leading the radio during different flaring periods. The time lags between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission propose the presence of multiple $\gamma$-ray emission sites in the source. As seen in 43 GHz images from the Very Long Baseline Array, two moving disturbances (or shocks) were newly ejected from the radio core. The $\gamma$-ray flares from 2016 to 2017 are temporally coincident with the interaction between a traveling shock and a quasi-stationary one at $\sim$0.1 mas from the core. The other shock is found to emerge from the core nearly simultaneous with the $\gamma$-ray flare in 2018. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray flares originated from shock-shock interactions.","['Sanghyun Kim', 'Sang-Sung Lee', 'Juan Carlos Algaba', 'Bindu Rani', 'Jongho Park', 'Hyeon-Woo Jeong', 'Whee Yeon Cheong', ""Filippo D'Ammando"", 'Anne Lähteenmäki', 'Merja Tornikoski', 'Joni Tammi', 'Venkatessh Ramakrishnan', 'Iván Agudo', 'Carolina Casadio', 'Juan Escudero', 'Antonio Fuentes', 'Efthalia Traianou', 'Ioannis Myserlis', 'Clemens Thum']",15.0,14.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08574,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal – Gamma rays: galaxies – Galaxies: active – Galaxies: jets – quasars: individual: CTA 102 1'],2025-01-16
Impact of particle production during inflation on the detection of CMB B-mode polarization,"This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about three thousandths of that of primordial GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of a detected CMB B-mode polarization. However, to precisely confirm the energy scale of inflation and extract information about quantum gravity, distinguishing between the CMB B-mode polarization from different sources is crucial. We compare the total power spectrum with that of primordial GWs, revealing a characteristic peak in the total spectrum. This peak can be used to test the model and differentiate it from other inflationary sources.","['Xunliang Yang', 'Zhe Yu', 'Zhoujian Cao']",4.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08592,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-16
"The polarisation behaviour of OJ 287 viewed through radio, millimetre and optical observations between 2015 and 2017","OJ 287 is a bright blazar with century-long observations, and one of the strongest candidates to host a supermassive black hole binary. Its polarisation behaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting events that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric and polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light curves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength polarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing multifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of very-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86 GHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general relativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near the accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the onset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the additional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210 degrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link between these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of 0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015 flare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the quasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the very-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the mm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data but show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates that the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the cm-bands.","['J. Jormanainen', 'T. Hovatta', 'E. Lindfors', 'A. Berdyugin', 'W. Chamani', 'V.

Improvements to monoscopic analysis for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes: Application to H.E.S.S,"Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect gamma rays by measuring the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles in the air shower when the gamma rays hit the atmosphere. At low energies, the limited amount of Cherenkov light produced typically implies that the event is registered by one IACT only. Such events are called monoscopic events, and their analysis is particularly difficult. Challenges include the reconstruction of the event's arrival direction, energy, and the rejection of background events. Here, we present a set of improvements, including a machine-learning algorithm to determine the correct orientation of the image, an intensity-dependent selection cut that ensures optimal performance, and a collection of new image parameters. To quantify these improvements, we use the central telescope of the H.E.S.S. IACT array. Knowing the correct image orientation, which corresponds to the arrival direction of the photon in the camera frame, is especially important for the angular reconstruction, which could be improved in resolution by 57% at 100 GeV. The event selection cut, which now depends on the total measured intensity of the events, leads to a reduction of the low-energy threshold for source analyses by ~50%. The new image parameters characterize the intensity and time distribution within the recorded images and complement the traditionally used Hillas parameters in the machine learning algorithms. We evaluate their importance to the algorithms in a systematic approach and carefully evaluate associated systematic uncertainties. We find that including subsets of the new variables in machine-learning algorithms improves the reconstruction and background rejection, resulting in a sensitivity improved by 41% at the low-energy threshold.","['Tim Unbehaun', 'Rodrigo Guedes Lang', 'Anita Deka Baruah', 'Prajath Bedur Ramesh', 'Jelena Celic', 'Lars Mohrmann', 'Simon Steinmassl', 'Laura Olivera-Nieto', 'Jim Hinton', 'Stefan Funk']",15.0,22.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08671,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,[],2025-01-16
The putative center in NGC 1052,"Many active galaxies harbor powerful relativistic jets, however, the detailed mechanisms of their formation and acceleration remain poorly understood. To investigate the area of jet acceleration and collimation with the highest available angular resolution, we study the innermost region of the bipolar jet in the nearby low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy NGC 1052. We combined observations of NGC 1052 taken with VLBA, GMVA, and EHT over one week in the spring of 2017. For the first time, NGC 1052 was detected with the EHT, providing a size of the central region in-between both jet bases of 250 RS (Schwarzschild radii) perpendicular to the jet axes. This size estimate supports previous studies of the jets expansion profile which suggest two breaks of the profile at around 300 RS and 10000 RS distances to the core. Furthermore, we estimated the magnetic field to be 1.25 Gauss at a distance of 22 {\mu}as from the central engine by fitting a synchrotron-self absorption spectrum to the innermost emission feature, which shows a spectral turn-over at about 130 GHz. Assuming a purely poloidal magnetic field, this implies an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at the event horizon of 26000 Gauss, which is consistent with previous measurements. The complex, low-brightness, double-sided jet structure in NGC 1052 makes it a challenge to detect the source at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. However, our first EHT observations have demonstrated that detection is possible up to at least 230 GHz. This study offers a glimpse through the dense surrounding torus and into the innermost central region, where the jets are formed. This has enabled us to finally resolve this region and provide improved constraints on its expansion and magnetic field strength.","['Anne-Kathrin Baczko', 'Matthias Kadler', 'Eduardo Ros', 'Christian M.

"Final design of Cerberus, a three-headed instrument for the OARPAF telescope","Cerberus will be a new scientific instrument for the alt-az, 1m-class OARPAF telescope in Northern Italy.

Complex Structure around a Circumstellar Disk Caused by Interchange Instability,"We perform a three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a strongly magnetized cloud core and investigate the complex structure caused by the interchange instability. This is the first simulation that does not use a central sink cell and calculates the long term ($> 10^4$ yr) evolution even as the disk and outflow formation occur. The magnetic field dissipates inside the disk, and magnetic flux accumulates around the edge of the disk, leading to the occurrence of interchange instability. During the main accretion phase, the interchange instability occurs recurrently, disturbing the circumstellar region and forming ring, arc, and cavity structures. These are consistent with recent high-resolution observations of circumstellar regions around young protostars. The structures extend to $>1,000$ au and persist for at least 30,000 yr after protostar formation, demonstrating the dynamic removal process of magnetic flux during star formation. We find that the disk continues to grow even as interchange instability occurs, by accretion through channels between the outgoing cavities. The outflow is initially weak, but becomes strong after $\sim 10^3$ yr.","['Masahiro N.

Cyclical accretion regime change in the slow X-ray pulsar 4U 0114+65 observed with Chandra,"4U 0114+65 is a high-mass X-ray binary system formed by the luminous supergiant B1Ia, known as V{*} V662 Cas, and one of the slowest rotating neutron stars (NS) with a spin period of about 2.6 hours. This fact provides a rare opportunity to study interesting details of the accretion within each individual pulse of the compact object. In this paper, we analyze 200 ks of Chandra grating data, divided into 9 uninterrupted observations around the orbit. The changes in the circumstellar absorption column through the orbit suggest an orbital inclination of $\sim$ $40^{\circ}$ with respect to the observer and a companion mass-loss rate of $\sim$ 8.6 10$^{-7}$ solar masses yr$^{-1}$. The peaks of the NS pulse show a large pulse-to-pulse variability. Three of them show an evolution from a brighter regime to a weaker one. We propose that the efficiency of Compton cooling in this source fluctuates throughout an accumulation cycle. After significant depletion of matter within the magnetosphere, since the settling velocity is $\sim \times$ 2 times lower than the free-fall velocity, the source gradually accumulates matter until the density exceeds a critical threshold. This increase in density triggers a transition to a more efficient Compton cooling regime, leading to a higher mass accretion rate and consequently to an increased brightness.","['Graciela Sanjurjo-Ferrín', 'Jose Miguel Torrejón', 'Konstantin Postnov', 'Michael Nowak', 'Jose Joaquín Rodes-Roca', 'Lida Oskinova', 'Jessica Planelles-Villalva', 'Norber Schulz']",14.0,11.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08702,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['X-rays: binaries', 'individual 4U 0114 +65', 'X-rays 1', 'Physical data and processes: Accretion – (Stars:) pulsars Stars: magnetars']",2025-01-16
Pixelization effects in cosmic shear angular power spectra,"We conduct a comprehensive study into the impact of pixelization on cosmic shear, uncovering several sources of bias in standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators based on discrete catalogues. We derive models that can bring residual biases to the percent level on small scales. We elucidate the impact of aliasing and the varying shape of HEALPix pixels on power spectra and show how the HEALPix pixel window function approximation is made in the discrete spin-2 setting. We propose several improvements to the standard estimator and its modelling, based on the principle that source positions and weights are to be considered fixed. We show how empty pixels can be accounted for either by modifying the mixing matrices or applying correction factors that we derive. We introduce an approximate interlacing scheme for the HEALPix grid and show that it can mitigate the effects of aliasing. We introduce bespoke pixel window functions adapted to the survey footprint and show that, for band-limited spectra, biases from using an isotropic window function can be effectively reduced to zero. This work partly intends to serve as a useful reference for pixel-related effects in angular power spectra, which are of relevance for ongoing and forthcoming lensing and clustering surveys.","['Alex Hall', 'Nicolas Tessore']",17.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08718,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-16
Black hole accretion and radiation variability in GRMHD simulations with Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime,"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revealed the horizon-scale radiation of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), our galaxy's central supermassive black hole, offering a new platform to test gravitational theories. The next step involves studying accretion flows and spacetime structures near black holes using EHT time variability data and GRMHD simulations. We study accretion dynamics in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes deviating from general relativity, using 2D GRMHD simulations with Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime. This study systematically investigates how light curve variability amplitudes from non-Kerr GRMHD simulations depend on Schwarzschild spacetime deviations, based on the constraints from weak gravitational fields and Sgr A*'s shadow size. We find that the dynamics of accretion flows systematically depend on the deviation. In spacetimes with a deeper gravitational potential, fluid and Alfvén velocities consistently decrease relative to the Schwarzschild metric, indicating weaker dynamical behavior. We also examine the influence of spacetime deviations on radiation properties by computing luminosity fluctuations at 230 GHz using general relativistic radiative transfer simulations, in line with EHT observations. The amplitude of these fluctuations exhibits a systematic dependence on the deviation parameters, decreasing for deeper gravitational potentials compared to the Schwarzschild metric. These features are validated using one of the theoretically predicted metrics, the Hayward metric, a model that describes nonsingular black holes. This characteristic is expected to have similar effects in future comprehensive simulations that include more realistic accretion disk models and electron cooling in the future, potentially aiding in distinguishing black hole solutions that explain the variability of Sgr A*.","['Kotaro Moriyama', 'Alejandro Cruz-Osorio', 'Yosuke Mizuno', 'Indu K.

Interplay between tidal flows and magnetic fields in nonlinear simulations of stellar and planetary convective envelopes,"Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfvén waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.","['Aurélie Astoul', 'Adrian J.

A Quasi-Optimal Stacking Method for Up-the-Ramp Readout Images,"The non-destructive readout mode of a detector allows its pixels to be read multiple times during integration, generating a series of ""up-the-ramp"" images that keep accumulating photons between successive frames. Since the noise is correlated across these images, an optimal stacking generally requires weighting them unequally to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the target. Objects in the sky show wildly different brightness, and the counts in the pixels of the same object also span a wide range. Therefore, a single set of weights cannot be optimal for all cases. To keep the stacked image more easily calibratable, however, we choose to apply the same weight to all the pixels in the same frame. In practice, we find that the results of high-SNR cases degrade only slightly by adopting weights derived for low-SNR cases, whereas the low-SNR cases are more sensitive to the weights applied. We therefore propose a quasi-optimal stacking method that maximizes the stacked SNR for the case of SNR=1 per pixel in the last frame and demonstrate with simulated data that it always enhances the SNR more than the equal-weight stacking method and the ramp fitting method. Furthermore, we give an estimate of the improvement of limiting magnitudes for the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) based on this method. Compared with the conventional readout mode, which is equivalent to taking the last frame of the non-destructive readout, stacking 30 up-the-ramp images can improve the limiting magnitude by about 0.5 mag for CSST near-infrared observations, effectively reducing the readout noise by about 62%.","['Guanghuan Wang', 'Hu Zhan', 'Zun Luo', 'Chengqi Liu', 'Youhua Xu', 'Chun Lin', 'Yanfeng Wei', 'WenLong Fan']",4.0,10.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08732,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,['Astronomical Astronomical detectors(84) — Infrared observatories(791) — Astronomy data reduction(1861) — Astronomy image processing(2306) 1'],2025-01-16
An Ultra-Wideband Dual Polarization Antenna Array for the Detection and Localization of Bright Fast Radio Transients in the Milky Way,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extraordinary astrophysical phenomena characterized by short radio pulses that last only a few milliseconds, yet their power can surpass that of 500 million suns. To date, most detected FRBs originate from beyond our galaxy. However, if an FRB were to originate within the Milky Way, it could be detected using small antennas. In this paper, we propose a compact and ad-hoc antenna array designed for the efficient detection and localization of FRBs within the Milky Way. The antenna operates within the 1200-1800 MHz range and consists of three sub-arrays placed in an L-shape for source localization, occupying a total volume of 80x25x6 cm^3. Each sub-array consists of 4 miniaturized, dual-polarized, half-space radiation antenna elements, forming a one-dimensional array that allows shaping the radiation pattern to match the form of the Milky Way without exhibiting grating lobes. A prototype was constructed and characterized to validate the design. The measured results exhibit good agreement with the simulations. In addition to having a custom elongated radiation pattern, the array has attractive merits, such as low reflections at the input ports, high radiation efficiency, and a distribution that inhibits the existence of phase ambiguities, thus facilitating source localization.","['Diego Gallardo', 'Ricardo Finger', 'Francisca Solis', 'David Monasterio', 'Sebastián Jorquera', 'José Pizarro', 'Juan Riquelme', 'Franco Curotto', 'Francisco Pizarro', 'Leonardo Bronfman']",20.0,19.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08764,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,[': Antenna arrays'],2025-01-16
Growth of Diffuse Intragroup Light in Simulated Galaxy Groups,"The diffuse intragroup light (IGL) is a pervasive feature of galaxy groups consisting of an extended low-surface-brightness component that permeates the intergalactic medium of these galaxy associations. It is primarily formed by stars separated from their host galaxies and now drift freely, unbound to any particular galaxy. We used controlled numerical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of IGL in galaxy groups during the pre-virialization phase. Our study reveals that the emergence of this diffuse luminous component typically begins to form in significant amounts around the turnaround epoch, increasing steadily thereafter. We analyzed the correlation between the mass and fraction of IGL and other group properties. We found a sublinear relationship between the IGL mass and the brightest group galaxy, suggesting intertwined formation histories but with potentially differing growth rates and distinct driving mechanisms. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between the IGL fraction and the group's velocity dispersion, indicating that a lower velocity dispersion may enhance IGL formation through increased gravitational interaction effectiveness. Furthermore, our comparative analysis of the density profiles of IGL and total system mass revealed significant similarities, suggesting that the intragroup light serves as a reliable tracer of the gravitational potential of host groups, even when these galaxy aggregations are far from dynamic equilibrium.","['B.

Discovery of a years-delayed radio flare from an unusually slow-evolved tidal disruption event,"SDSS J1115+0544 is a unique low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy with energetic ultraviolet (UV), optical and mid-infrared outbursts occurring in its nucleus. We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period of ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of ~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level, suggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually slow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found. Three years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found with a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard equipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was launched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta<~0.1 and kinetic energy of E_K~>10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing plateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario involving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk. SDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical plateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations of these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the connection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.","['Zhumao Zhang', 'Xinwen Shu', 'Lei Yang', 'Luming Sun', 'Hucheng Ding', 'Lin Yan', 'Ning Jiang', 'Fangxia An', 'Walter Silima', 'Fabao Zhang', 'Yogesh Chandola', 'Zhongzu Wu', 'Daizhong Liu', 'Liming Dou', 'Jianguo Wang', 'Yibo Wang', 'Chenwei Yang', 'Di Li', 'Tianyao Zhou', 'Wenjie Zhang', 'Fangkun Peng', 'Tinggui Wang']",5.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08812,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Accretion (14)'],2025-01-16
The post-gas expulsion coalescence of embedded clusters as an origin of open clusters,"The mismatch between the mass function of the Milky Way's embedded clusters (ECs) and that of open clusters (OCs) raises the question of whether each OC originates from a single EC. In this work, we explore a scenario in which OCs form as a result of post-gas expulsion coalescence of ECs within the same parental molecular cloud. We model this process using N-body simulations of ECs undergoing expansion due to gas expulsion. Our initial conditions are based on the observed spatial, kinematic, and mass distributions of ECs in three representative massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). Initially, ECs are isolated. After further expansion, interactions between ECs begin, mutually influencing their evolution. We examine this process as a function of gas expulsion timescales, spatial separations between ECs, and their relative velocities. Our results demonstrate that, within a reasonable range of these parameters, the coalescence of ECs is robust and largely insensitive to initial conditions. The mass of ECs plays a critical role in the coalescence process. More massive ECs form stable gravitational cores, which greatly facilitate coalescence and help the resulting cluster resist expansion and Galactic tidal forces. Additionally, the number of ECs also enhances coalescence. The current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way suggests that directly forming massive ECs is challenging. However, the coalescence of multiple low-mass ECs can account for the observed parameter space of OCs in the Milky Way.","['J. W.

High Lithium Abundance Connection with the Chromospheric Helium in Red Giants: Spectroscopic and Asteroseismic analyses,"We present a study of correlations between high Li abundances and strong chromospheric He I 10830 Å absorption line strengths in Kepler field giant stars. Our sample includes 84 giants with detectable solar-like oscillations in their lightcurves, and their Li abundances come from the literature or were measured here using LAMOST medium-resolution spectra. Evolutionary phases are determined through asteroseismic analysis, with mixed-mode period spacing (\Delta P) used to infer the time evolution of RC giants. Near-infrared observations of the He I \lambda 10830 line were obtained with the high-resolution Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). We find high Li abundances and strong He I lines exclusively among red clump (RC) giants, with their absence in red giant branch stars suggesting a shared origin linked to the He-flash. Additionally, a steady decline in He I strength with decreasing Li abundance among RC giants indicates a correlation between these properties. Older, Li-normal RC giants are He-weak, while most younger super-Li-rich giants are He-strong, suggesting temporal evolution of both phenomena. We hypothesize that the core He-flash and subsequent sub-flashes may enhance Li abundances in RC giant photospheres and trigger heightened chromospheric activity, leading to stronger He I \lambda 10830 Å lines in younger RCs. Over time, post-He-flash, chromospheric activity diminishes, resulting in weaker He I lines in older, Li-normal RCs.","['Anohita Mallick', 'Christopher Sneden', 'Bacham E.

An investigation of the relationship between morphology and chemistry of the D-type spherules from the recovery expedition of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide: Implications for origins,"Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as ""D-type"" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: ""scoriaceous,"" ""stubby,"" ""blocky,"" and ""vesicular."" The specimens from the ""scoriaceous"" and ""stubby"" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting ""blocky"" and ""vesicular"" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.","['Eugenia Hyung', 'Juliana Cherston', 'Stein B.

On the abiotic origin of dimethyl sulfide: discovery of DMS in the Interstellar Medium,"Following the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (CH$_3$SCH$_3$, DMS) signatures in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we report the first detection of this organosulfur species in the interstellar medium, during the exploration of an ultradeep molecular line survey performed toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with the Yebes 40$\,$m and IRAM 30$\,$m telescopes. We derive a molecular column density of $N$ = (2.6 $\pm$ 0.3)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, yielding a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$1.9$\times$10$^{-10}$. This implies that DMS is a factor of $\sim$1.6 times less abundant than its structural isomer CH$_3$CH$_2$SH and $\sim$30 times less abundant than its O-analogue dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) toward this cloud, in excellent agreement with previous results on various O/S pairs. Furthermore, we find a remarkable resemblance between the relative abundance of DMS/CH$_3$OH in G+0.693-0.027 ($\sim$1.7$\times$10$^{-3}$) and in the comet ($\sim$1.3$\times$10$^{-3}$), further strengthening the connection between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and that of the minor bodies of the Solar System. Although the chemistry of DMS beyond Earth is yet to be fully disclosed, this discovery provides conclusive observational evidence on its efficient abiotic production in the interstellar medium, casting doubts about using DMS as a reliable biomarker in exoplanet science.","['Miguel Sanz-Novo', 'Víctor M.

The case for a low dark matter density in dynamical dark energy model from local probes,"In this work we investigate, through a Bayesian study, the ability of a local low matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$, in discrepancy with the value usually inferred from the CMB angular power spectrum, to accommodate observations from local probes without being in tension with the local values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ or the matter fluctuation $\sigma_8$ parameters. For that, we combine multiple local probes, with the criteria that they either can constrain the matter density parameter independently from the CMB constraints, or can help in doing so after making their relevant observations more model independent by relaxing their relevant calibration parameters. We assume however, either a dynamical dark energy model, or the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, when computing the corresponding theoretical observables. We also add, in almost all of our Monte Carlo runs, the latest Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI year one release to our core group. We found that, within $\Lambda$CDM model, for different combinations of our probes, we can accommodate a low matter density along with the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ values usually obtained from local probes, providing we promote the sound drag $r_s$ component in BAO calculations to a free parameter, and that even if we combine with the Pantheon+ Supernova sample. Assuming $w_0w_a$CDM, we also found that relaxing $r_s$ allow us to accommodate $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ within their local values, with still however a preference for $w_0w_a$ values far from $\Lambda$CDM. However, when including Pantheon+ Supernova sample, we found that the latter preference for high matter density pushes $\sigma_8$ to much smaller values, mitigating by then a low matter density solution to the two common tensions. We conclude that a low matter density value, helps in preserving the concordance within $\Lambda$CDM model.

Potential Contribution of Young Pulsar Wind Nebulae to Galactic High-Energy Neutrino Emission,"Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), especially the young ones, are among the most energetic astrophysical sources in the Galaxy. It is usually believed that the spin-down energy injected from the pulsars is converted into magnetic field and relativistic electrons, but the possible presence of proton acceleration inside PWNe cannot be ruled out. Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission from PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such results rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the contribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino emission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the ones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model the temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of protons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for young PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion fraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic process, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the neutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the measured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV. At higher energy around 1 PeV, the neutrino emission from the population highly depends on the injection spectral shape, and also on the emission of the nearby prominent sources.","['Xuan-Han Liang', 'Xiao-Bin Chen', 'Ben Li', 'Ruo-Yu Liu', 'Xiang-Yu Wang']",4.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08957,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Pulsar wind nebulae(2215) — Neutrino astronomy(1100) — Pulsars(1306) — High energy astrophysics(739) 1'],2025-01-16
Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey,"In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 <= z <= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.","['Takashi J.

Heavy Axions Can Disrupt $\gamma$-ray Bursts,"Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be produced in the hot dense plasma of fireballs that develop in the initial stage of $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) outflows. They can transport an enormous amount of energy away from the jet by propagating out of the fireball. The photons produced by the eventual decay of such ALPs do not reach a sufficient density to re-thermalize through pair production, preventing fireball re-emergence. Thus, the production of heavy ALPs disrupts the fireball and dims GRBs, allowing bright GRB observations to strongly constrain the existence of heavy ALPs. By adding ALP interactions to existing models of GRB fireballs, we set competitive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling down to $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \sim 4 \times 10^{-12}~{\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}}$ for ALPs in the mass range of 200 MeV - 5 GeV.","['Oindrila Ghosh', 'Sunniva Jacobsen', 'Tim Linden']",4.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08978,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-16
Empirical Constraints on Tidal Dissipation in Exoplanet Host Stars,"The orbits of short-period exoplanets are sculpted by tidal dissipation. However, the mechanisms and associated efficiencies of these tidal interactions are poorly constrained. We present robust constraints on the tidal quality factors of short-period exoplanetary host stars through the usage of a novel empirical technique. The method is based on analyzing structures in the population-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time remaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides. Using simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we show that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution with an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly evident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet population. We use this to constrain both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the stellar tidal quality factor and show that it must decrease sharply with planetary orbital period. Specifically, with $Q_{\star}' = Q_0 (P/2 \ \mathrm{days})^{\alpha}$, we find $10^{5.5} \lesssim Q_0 \lesssim 10^7$ and $-4.33 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -2$. Our results are most consistent with predictions from tidal resonance locking, in which the planets are locked into resonance with a tidally excited gravity mode in their host stars.","['Sarah C.

Searching for new variable white dwarfs: The discovery of the three new pulsating and three new binary systems,"In recent years, approximately 150 low-mass white dwarfs (WDs), typically with masses below 0.4 solar masses, have been discovered. Observational evidence indicates that most of these low-mass WDs are found in binary systems, supporting binary evolution scenarios as the primary formation pathway.A few extremely low-mass (ELM) WDs in this population have also been found to be pulsationally variable. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis aimed at identifying new variable low-mass WDs. From our candidate selection, we observed 16 objects identified within the ZZ Ceti instability strip. These objects were observed over multiple nights using high-speed photometry from the SOAR/Goodman and SMARTS-1m telescopes.Our analysis led to the discovery of three new pulsating WDs: one pulsating ELM, one low-mass WD, and one ZZ Ceti star. Additionally, we identified three objects in binary systems: two with ellipsoidal variations in their light curves, one of which is likely a pre-ELM star, and a third showing a reflection effect.","['Larissa Antunes Amaral', 'Maja Vučković', 'Ingrid Pelisoli', 'Alina Istrate', 'S.

Prompt gravitational-wave mergers aided by gas in Active Galactic Nuclei: The hydrodynamics of binary-single black hole scatterings,"Black hole binary systems embedded in AGN discs have been proposed as a source of the observed gravitational waves (GWs) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Studies have indicated binary-single encounters could be common place within this population, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the ambient gas affects the dynamics of these three-body encounters. We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of black hole binary-single encounters in an AGN disc. We find gas is a non-negligible component of binary-single interactions, leading to unique dynamics, including the formation of quasi-stable hierarchical triples. The gas efficiently and reliably dissipates the energy of the three-body system, hardening the triple provided it remains bound after the initial encounter. The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas densities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of magnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few AGN orbits, limited only by our resolution. We calculate that the gas hardening of the triple enhances the probability for a merger by a minimum factor of $3.5-8$ depending on our assumptions. In several cases, two of the black holes can execute periapses on the order of less than $10$ Schwarzschild radii, where the dynamics were fully resolved for previous close approaches. The likelihood of these prompt mergers increases when the gas density is larger. Our results suggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single induced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the prospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual eccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.","['Connar Rowan', 'Henry Whitehead', 'Gaia Fabj', 'Pankaj Saini', 'Bence Kocsis', 'Martin Pessah', 'Johan Samsing']",10.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09017,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['binaries: general – transients: black hole mergers – galaxies: nuclei – hydrodynamics – gravitational waves 1 INTRODUCTION The astrophysical mechanisms driving compact object mergers and observedgravitationalwave(GW)sourcesAbbottetal'],2025-01-16
Improving the stellar age determination through joint modeling of binarity and asteroseismology - Grid modeling of the seismic red-giant binary KIC 9163796,"Context. Typical uncertainties of ages determined for single star giants from isochrone fitting using single-epoch spectroscopy and photometry without any additional constraints are 30-50 %. Binary systems, particularly double-lined spectroscopic (SB2) binaries, provide an opportunity to study the intricacies of internal stellar physics and better determine stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. Aims. By using the constraints from binarity and asteroseismology, we aim to obtain precise age and stellar parameters for the red giant-subgiant binary system KIC 9163796, a system with a mass ratio of 1.015 but distinctly different positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Methods. We compute a multidimensional model grid of individual stellar models. From different combinations of figures of merit, we use the constraints drawn from binarity, spectroscopy, and asteroseismology to determine the stellar mass, chemical composition, and age of KIC 9163796. Results. Our combined-modeling approach leads to an age estimation of the binary system KIC 9163796 of 2.44$^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$ Gyr, which corresponds to a relative error in the age of 9 %. Furthermore, we found both components exhibiting equal initial helium abundance of 0.27 to 0.30, significantly higher than the primordial helium abundance, and an initial heavy metal abundance below the spectroscopic value. The masses of our models are in agreement with masses derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations. Conclusions. By exploiting the unique, distinct positions of KIC 9163796, we successfully demonstrated that combining asteroseismic and binary constraints leads to a significant improvement of precision in age estimation, that have a relative error below 10% for a giant star.","['D.

REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS): A population of 74 resolved planetesimal belts at millimetre wavelengths,"Planetesimal belts are ubiquitous around nearby stars, and their spatial properties hold crucial information for planetesimal and planet formation models. We present resolved dust observations of 74 planetary systems as part of the REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS) survey and archival reanalysis. We uniformly modelled interferometric visibilities for the entire sample to obtain the basic spatial properties of each belt, and combined these with constraints from multi-wavelength photometry. We report key findings from a first exploration of this legacy dataset: (1) Belt dust masses are depleted over time in a radially dependent way, with dust being depleted faster in smaller belts, as predicted by collisional evolution. (2) Most belts are broad discs rather than narrow rings, with much broader fractional widths than rings in protoplanetary discs. We link broad belts to either unresolved substructure or broad planetesimal discs produced if protoplanetary rings migrate. (3) The vertical aspect ratios (h = H/R) of 24 belts indicate orbital inclinations of 1-20 degrees, implying relative particle velocities of 0.1-4 km/s, and no clear evolution of heights with system age. This could be explained by early stirring within the belt by large bodies (with sizes of at least 140 km to the size of the Moon), by inheritance of inclinations from the protoplanetary disc stage, or by a diversity in evolutionary pathways and gravitational stirring mechanisms.

The COSMOS-Web deep galaxy group catalog up to $z=3.7$,"Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z>2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%.

Searching for Quiescent Galaxies over $3 < z < 6$ in JWST Surveys Using Manifold Learning,"Quiescent galaxies over $3<z<6$ are rare and puzzling. They formed and quenched within two billion years and simulations routinely struggle to predict their observed abundances. Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at $z\gtrsim3$. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only $\lesssim1\%$ of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over $3<z<6$ using observed NIRCam colors. From a parent sample of 43,926 galaxies in JADES, we ultimately find 44 quiescent candidates from a pool of $\approx2,300$ galaxies. This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as $\lesssim300$ Myr. We obtain number densities in agreement with the literature at $z<4$ and find generally higher abundances at $z>4$, although our measurements are consistent within errors. This technique may be applied to other JWST surveys.","['Alexander de la Vega', 'Mitchell D. Babcock', 'Bahram Mobasher', 'Dominik A. Riemann', 'Nima Chartab', 'Shoubaneh Hemmati', 'Arianna S.

Assuming Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos, the masses for the northern and southern subclusters are $M_{200c}^{N} = 0.88_{-0.30}^{+0.35} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200c}^{S} = 2.71_{-0.48}^{+0.51} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, respectively. By superposing the two NFW halos, we determine the total mass of the cluster to be $M_{200c} = 4.22_{-1.00}^{+1.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500c} = 2.90_{-0.69}^{+0.75} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Our mass estimate suggests that the two relics are located around the cluster $R_{200c}$, where the density of the intracluster medium is very low. Our idealized simulations find that an off-axis collision of a 3:1 major merger can simultaneously reproduce the observed relic and dark matter halo separations. From these findings, we suggest that the system is observed ~0.9 Gyr after the first pericenter passage and is returning from the first apocenter.","['Eunmo Ahn', 'Hyejeon Cho', 'M.

Spin-Orbit Alignment in Merging Binary Black Holes Following Collisions with Massive Stars,"Merging binary black holes (BBHs) formed dynamically in dense star clusters are expected to have uncorrelated spin--orbit orientations since they are assembled through many random interactions. However, measured effective spins in BBHs detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA hint at additional physical processes that may introduce anisotropy. Here we address this question by exploring the impact of stellar collisions, and accretion of collision debris, on the spin--orbit alignment in merging BBHs formed in dense star clusters. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we study the regime where the disruption of a massive star by a BBH causes the stellar debris to form individual accretion disks bound to each black hole. We show that these disks, which are randomly oriented relative to the binary orbital plane after the initial disruption of the star, can be reoriented by strong tidal torques in the binary near pericenter passages. Following accretion by the BHs on longer timescales, BBHs with small but preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.2$) are formed. Our results indicate that BBH collisions in young massive star clusters could contribute to the observed trend toward small positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and we suggest that the standard assumption often made that dynamically assembled BBHs should have isotropically distributed BH spins is not always justified.","['Fulya Kıroğlu', 'James C.

"Zapped then Napped? A rapidly quenched, remnant leaker candidate with a steep spectroscopic $\beta_{UV}$ slope at z=8.5","We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass ""mini-quenched"" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of >10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z ""remnant leaker"" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.","['William M.

Genesis of the James Webb Space Telescope Architecture: The Designers' Story,"The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is an infrared observatory of novel design: deployable, with active optics, fully open to space for radiative cooling and orbiting the Lagrange point no. 2. This article explains the rationale leading to this specific design and describes the various other architectures that were considered along the way: from a monolithic 10-meter telescope in geosynchronous orbit to a 6-meter one in High Earth Orbit, then a 16-meter observatory on the Moon, a 4- or 6-meter one in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, and a segmented 8-meter one passively cooled to 50 K at L2, which was finally descoped to 6.6 meters. It also addresses the optimization for scientific performance, the challenge of dealing with such an ultra-low operating temperature, cost issues, supporting technology, modifications made during final design and, finally, how the architecture performs on orbit.","['Pierre Y.

State-dependent signatures of jets and winds in the optical and infrared spectrum of the black hole transient GX 339$-$4,"GX 339$-$4 is one of the prototypical black hole X-ray transients, exhibiting recurrent outbursts that allow detailed studies of black hole accretion and ejection phenomena. In this work we present four epochs of optical and near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. The dataset includes two hard state spectra, collected during the 2013 and 2015 outbursts, and two soft state spectra observed during the 2021 outburst. Strong Balmer, Paschen, He I and He II emission lines are consistently observed in all spectra, while Brackett transitions and the Bowen blend are only prominent in the soft state. Although P-Cygni profiles are not identified, the presence of wind signatures, such as extended emission wings, flat-top and asymmetric red-skewed profiles, is consistently observed through most emission lines, suggesting the presence of wind-type ejecta. These features are particularly evident in the hard state, but they are also observed in the soft state, especially in the near-infrared. This strengthens the case for state-independent winds in black hole transients and increases the evidence for wind signatures in low-to-intermediate orbital inclination systems. We also study the spectral energy distribution, which provides evidence for the presence of synchrotron emission during the hard state. The jet significantly affects the near-infrared continuum, greatly diluting the emission features produced in the accretion flow. The simultaneous identification of both jet and wind signatures during the hard state reinforces the idea of a complex outflow scenario, in which different types of ejecta coexist.","['A.

A novel q-PED method: precise physical properties of a merger-origin binary Cepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347,"Recently, a double-lined binary (SB2) classical Cepheid, OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347, was discovered, with the orbital period (P$_{\rm orb} = 59$ days) five times shorter than of any binary Cepheid known before. The expected mass of the Cepheid was below $3.5$ M$_\odot$, which, if confirmed, would also probe the uncharted territory. The system configuration also pointed to the Cepheid as a merger. We present a novel method for determining precise physical parameters of binary Cepheids using both theory and observations. This q-PED method combines the measured mass ratio (q), pulsation (P), and evolutionary (E) models, and the known distance (D) supplemented with multi-band photometry. Applying it, we determined the mass of the Cepheid of $3.42 \pm 0.09$ M$_\odot$, its radius of $13.65 \pm 0.27$ R$_\odot$, the companion mass of $1.89 \pm 0.04$ M$_\odot$ and radius of $12.5 \pm 0.62$ R$_\odot$. With the current configuration, the apparent evolutionary age difference of almost $1$ Gyr between the components strongly favors the Cepheid merger origin scenario. If so, the actual age of the Cepheid would be $1.1$ Gyr, on the edge of Population II stars, indicating a significant fraction of Cepheids may be much older than typically assumed. We also applied our method to an eclipsing binary Cepheid with accurately determined physical parameters, obtaining a close agreement, which confirmed our method's reliability.","['Felipe Espinoza-Arancibia', 'Bogumił Pilecki']",3.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09076,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],ApJL,,['Cepheid variable stars (218) — Double-mode Cepheid variable stars (402) — Spectroscopic binary stars (1557) 1'],2025-01-17
Assessing the dark matter content of two quasar host galaxies at z~6 through gas kinematics,"We conduct a study of the gas kinematics of two quasar host galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$ traced by the [CII] emission line using ALMA. By combining deep observations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission, resolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of the galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both galaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the galaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 2$ and inferred circular velocities out to $\sim$6-8 kpc scales, well beyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of each component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark matter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their effective radii ($f_{\rm DM}(R<R_e)$ = $0.61_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ and $0.53_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$, respectively), which are significantly larger than those extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under different input parameters verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The large $f_{\rm DM}(R<R_e)$ corresponds to halo masses of $\sim 10^{12.5}-10^{12.8}\, M_\odot$, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts. Notably, while the masses of these SMBHs are approximately 1 dex higher than the low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH and halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation of these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes in the early universe.","['Qinyue Fei', 'John D.

Ion densities of cold clouds driven by galactic outflows,"Observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) often display coincident absorption from species with widely varying ionization states, providing direct evidence for complex, multiphase interactions. Motivated by these measurements, we perform a series of cloud-crushing simulations that model cold clouds traveling through the hot CGM. We analyze the ion distributions of these clouds, generate mock absorption spectra, and study their implications on quasar (QSO) absorption observations. Our results show interesting multiphase features, in which ions with significantly different ionization potentials exist in the same absorber and share similar spectral features. However, our simulations are unable to explain high ions like O \textsc{vi} and their coexistence with lower ions that appear in many observed QSO absorption systems.","['Lisiyuan Yang', 'Neal Katz', 'Evan Scannapieco', 'Marcus Brüggen']",15.0,22.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09083,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['quasars: absorption lines – hydrodynamics 1 INTRODUCTION The circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) are believed to play an important role in the evolution of galaxies (Putman et al'],2025-01-17
TeV afterglow emission from a multi-component GRB jet using the kinetic approach,"Recent years have seen a growing sample of TeV emission detections in gamma-ray burst afterglows, as well as an increasing role for structured jets in afterglow modelling. Using a kinetic approach, we show that the structure of an afterglow jet impacts its TeV emission, with jets where the energy falls off more sharply with angle showing a decrease in Inverse Compton (IC) peak flux relative to synchrotron peak flux. We use a modified version of the code katu, to which we have added adiabatic expansion and a fully self-consistent treatment of IC cooling both for the electron and photon populations. We compare our results to the semi-analytical code afterglowpy, finding a good agreement with our model except at early times off axis where the effects of baryon loading are important. We compare electron cooling in the cases where there is no IC cooling, Thomson cooling and an inclusion of Klein-Nishina effects, finding that the spectra can only be distinguished if the Compton potential is significantly increased. The smooth and gradual transition of our KN cooling also leads to a disparity in the cooling between our results and semi-analytical solutions based on asymptotic limits. Finally, we combine best fit parameters from afterglowpy to reproduce the light curves of GRB 170817A in our model. For our choice of parameters, we find that GRB 170817 would not have been detected in the TeV domain if seen on-axis, even by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.","['John P.

A Pair of Dynamically Interacting Sub-Neptunes Around TOI-6054,"We confirm the planetary nature of a pair of transiting sub-Neptune exoplanets orbiting the bright F-type sub-giant star TOI-6054 ($V=8.02$, $K=6.673$) as a part of the OrCAS radial velocity survey using WIYN/NEID observations. We find that TOI-6054b and TOI-6054c have radii of $2.65 \pm 0.15$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $2.81 \pm 0.18$ $R_{\oplus}$, respectively, and masses of $12.4 \pm 1.7$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $9.2 \pm 2.0$ $M_{\oplus}$. The planets have zero-albedo equilibrium temperatures of $1360 \pm 33$ K and $1144 \pm 28$ K. The host star has expanded and will evolve off of the Main Sequence within the next $\sim$500 Myr, and the resulting increase in stellar luminosity has more than doubled the stellar flux the two planets receive compared to the start of the host star's main sequence phase. Consequently, TOI-6054b may be losing some of its primordial H/He atmosphere -- if it has one. Based on dynamical simulations performed using the orbital parameters of the two planets, TOI-6054b, and TOI-6054c are very likely in a 5:3 mean motion resonance. The TOI-6054 system thus has the potential to be an excellent candidate for future atmospheric follow-up observations, with two similarly sized sub-Neptunes around a bright star. We also estimate that if TOI-6054b is currently losing its H/He atmosphere this should be observable from space and from the ground.","['Maxwell A. Kroft', 'Thomas G. Beatty', 'Ian J. M.

Boosting Supermassive Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe by Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons,"Observations of massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe challenge existing black hole formation models. We propose that soliton cores in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) offer a potential solution to this timing problem. Our FDM cosmological zoom-in simulations confirm that for a particle mass $m_{\rm FDM}\sim 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$, solitons are well developed at redshift $z \sim 7$ with masses of $\sim10^9~M_\odot$, comparable to the observed SMBHs. We then demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations that, compared to cold dark matter, these high-$z$ massive FDM solitons with mass $M_s$ can provide additional gravitational potential to accrete gas and boost the Bondi accretion rate of a growing black hole seed with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ by up to two to four orders of magnitude, in the regime of efficient cooling and negligible radiation pressure. This accretion boosting mechanism is effective for $10^{-22}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm FDM} \lesssim 10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$ and potentially beyond as long as $M_s > M_{\rm BH}$.

Blazars Jets and prospects for TeV-PeV neutrinos & gamma-rays through cosmic-ray interactions,"This study explores the origins of cosmic rays and their secondary messengers, focusing on the potential role of four BL Lacs W Comae, 1ES 1959+650, PKS 2005-489, and PKS 2155-304 as potential sources of astrophysical neutrinos and gamma rays. We analyzed a single-zone model to understand the interactions between high-energy protons and ambient photons within blazar jets, leading to neutrino production observables and gamma-ray emission. This modeling contextualizes the emissions within multiwavelength observations and evaluates the capabilities of the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) in detecting these emissions.

Mantis Shrimp: Exploring Photometric Band Utilization in Computer Vision Networks for Photometric Redshift Estimation,"We present Mantis Shrimp, a multi-survey deep learning model for photometric redshift estimation that fuses ultra-violet (GALEX), optical (PanSTARRS), and infrared (UnWISE) imagery. Machine learning is now an established approach for photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design complexities: it is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different instruments which have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated and the point estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2) and catastrophic outlier rate ($\eta$=17.53$\%$). We find that early fusion approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments) match the performance of late fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the user. Finally, we study how the models learn to use information across bands, finding evidence that our models successfully incorporates information from all surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of galaxies is limited by the speed of downloading cutouts from external servers; however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as generating priors over redshift for stellar population synthesis.","['Andrew Engel', 'Nell Byler', 'Adam Tsou', 'Gautham Narayan', 'Emmanuel Bonilla', 'Ian Smith']",13.0,31.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09112,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Artificial Intelligence'],,,"['Galaxy redshifts(1378) — Neural networks(1933) — Astronomy data analysis(1858) 1', 'defined in each survey']",2025-01-17
The emission of interpulses by a 6.45-hour period coherent radio transient,"Long-period radio transients are a novel class of astronomical objects characterised by prolonged periods ranging from 18 minutes to 54 minutes. They exhibit highly polarised, coherent, beamed radio emission lasting only 10--100 seconds. The intrinsic nature of these objects is subject to speculation, with highly magnetised white dwarfs and neutron stars being the prevailing candidates. Here we present ASKAP J183950.5-075635.0 (hereafter, ASKAP J1839-0756), boasting the longest known period of this class at 6.45 hours. It exhibits emission characteristics of an ordered dipolar magnetic field, with pulsar-like bright main pulses and weaker interpulses offset by about half a period are indicative of an oblique or orthogonal rotator. This phenomenon, observed for the first time in a long-period radio transient, confirms that the radio emission originates from both magnetic poles and that the observed period corresponds to the rotation period. The spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of ASKAP J1839-0756 are consistent with a neutron star origin, and this object is a crucial piece of evidence in our understanding of long-period radio sources and their links to neutron stars.","['Y.

Cosmology from UNIONS weak lensing profiles of galaxy clusters,"Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters. In Universes with less matter and larger initial density perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region. Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectrsopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.29\pm 0.05$ and $\sigma_8=0.80 \pm 0.04$. We also measure mean (comoving) splashback radii for SPIDERS, M2C and DESI Legacy Imaging Survey clusters of $1.59^{+0.16}_{-0.13} {\rm cMpc}/h$, $1.30^{+0.25}_{-0.13} {\rm cMpc}/h$ and $1.45\pm0.11 {\rm cMpc}/h$ respectively. Performing this analysis with the final UNIONS shape catalogue and the full sample of spectroscopically observed clusters in DESI, we can expect to improve on the best current constraints from cluster abundance studies by a factor of 2 or more.","['Charlie T.

JERALD produces maps with dark matter, stellar and neutral hydrogen power spectra in excellent agreement with full-hydrodynamic simulations with $8\times$ higher resolution, at large and intermediate scales; in particular, JERALD's neutral hydrogen power spectra agree with their higher-resolution full-hydrodynamic counterparts within 90% up to $k\simeq1\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and within 70% up to $k\simeq10\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$. JERALD provides a fast, accurate and physically motivated approach that we plan to embed in a statistical inference pipeline, such as Simulation-Based Inference, to constrain dark matter properties from large- to intermediate-scale structure observables.","['Mauro Rigo', 'Roberto Trotta', 'Matteo Viel']",10.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09168,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-17
Direct evidence for $r$-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare,"The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.","['Anirudh Patel', 'Brian D.

XMM/HST monitoring of the ultra-soft highly accreting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 RBS 1332,"Ultra-soft narrow line Seyfert 1 (US-NLSy) are a poorly observed class of active galactic nuclei characterized by significant flux changes and an extreme soft X-ray excess. This peculiar spectral shape represents a golden opportunity to test whether the standard framework commonly adopted for modelling local AGN is still valid. We thus present the results on the joint XMM-Newton and HST monitoring campaign of the highly accreting US-NLSy RBS 1332. The optical-to-UV spectrum of RBS 1332 exhibits evidence of both a stratified narrow-line region and an ionized outflow, that produces absorption troughs over a wide range of velocities (from ~1500 km s-1 to ~1700 km s-1) in several high-ionization transitions (Lyalpha, N V, C IV). From a spectroscopic point of view, the optical/UV/FUV/X-rays emission of this source is due to the superposition of three distinct components which are best modelled in the context of the two-coronae framework in which the radiation of RBS 1332 can be ascribed to a standard outer disk, a warm Comptonization region and a soft coronal continuum. The present dataset is not compatible with a pure relativistic reflection scenario. Finally, the adoption of the novel model reXcor allowed us to determine that the soft X-ray excess in RBS 1332 is dominated by the emission of the optically thick and warm Comptonizing medium, and only marginal contribution is expected from relativistic reflection from a lamppost-like corona.","['R.

Simons Observatory: Characterization of the Large Aperture Telescope Receiver,"The Simons Observatory (SO) is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment that currently consists of three 0.42m small-aperture telescopes (SATs) and one 6m large- aperture telescope (LAT), located at an elevation of 5200m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. At the LAT's focal plane, SO will install >62,000 transition-edge sensor detectors across 13 optics tubes (OTs) within the Large Aperture Telescope Receiver (LATR), the largest cryogenic camera ever built to ob- serve the CMB. Here we report on the validation of the LATR in the laboratory and the subsequent dark testing and validation within the LAT. We show that the LATR meets cryogenic, optical, and detector specifications required for high-sensitivity measurements of the CMB. At the time of writing, the LATR is installed in the LAT with six OTs (corresponding to >31,000 detectors), and the LAT mirrors and remaining seven OTs are undergoing development.","['Tanay Bhandarkar', 'Saianeesh K.

A universal break in energy functions of three hyperactive repeating fast radio bursts,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration pulses occurring at cosmological distances with a mysterious origin. Observations show that at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars. All magnetar-powered FRB models require some triggering mechanisms, among which the most popular is the crust cracking of a neutron star, which is called starquake. However, so far there has been no decisive evidence for this speculation. Here we report the energy functions of the three most active repeating FRBs, which show a universal break around $10^{38}$ erg. Such a break is similar to that of the frequency-magnitude relationship of earthquakes. The break and change of the power-law indices below and above it can be well understood within the framework of FRBs triggered by starquakes in the magnetar models. The seed of weak FRBs can grow both on the magnetar surface and in the deeper crust. In contrast, the triggering of strong FRBs is confined by the crustal thickness and the seed of strong FRBs can only grow on the surface. This difference in dimensionality causes a break in the scaling properties from weak to strong FRBs, occurring at a point where the penetration depth of starquakes equals the crustal thickness. Our result, together with the earthquake-like temporal properties of these FRBs, strongly supports that FRBs are triggered by starquakes, providing a new opportunity to study the physical properties of the neutron star crust.","['Q.

Probing Cosmology with 92 Localized Fast Radio Bursts and DESI BAO,"Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) with $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. Given the cosmological origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the combination of their dispersion measures and host galaxy redshifts makes localized FRBs a valuable tool for probing cosmology. Using an updated sample of 92 localized FRBs, along with DESI BAO, PlantheonPlus and CMB data, we constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) under the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We find that even without incorporating CMB data, DDE remains preferred with $w_0 = -0.855 ^{+0.084}_{-0.084}$ and $w_a = -1.174^{+0.462}_{-0.491}$ at a confidence level of $\sim2.5 \sigma$. A joint analysis constrains these to be $w_0 = -0.784^{+0.064}_{-0.064}$ and $w_a = -0.872^{+0.269}_{-0.278}$, showing a discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM at a $\sim3.1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, using localized FRBs alone, we estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ to be $69.04^{+2.30}_{-2.07}$ and $75.61^{+2.23}_{-2.07} \, \rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$, assuming the Galactic electron density models to be NE2001 (Cordes \& Lazio) and YMW16 (Yao et al.), respectively. Thus, accurate accounting of the Galactic dispersion measure is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension with FRBs. Future BAO measurements, next-generation CMB experiments, and more localized FRBs will further constrain the DE EoS and the cosmological parameters.","['Yi-Ying Wang', 'Shi-Jie Gao', 'Yi-Zhong Fan']",5.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09260,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,[],2025-01-17
Search for neutrino doublets and triplets using 11.4 years of IceCube data,"We report a search for high-energy astrophysical neutrino multiplets, detections of multiple neutrino clusters in the same direction within 30 days, based on an analysis of 11.4 years of IceCube data. A new search method optimized for transient neutrino emission with a monthly time scale is employed, providing a higher sensitivity to neutrino fluxes. This result is sensitive to neutrino transient emission, reaching per-flavor flux of approximately $10^{-10}\ {\rm erg}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}\ {\rm sec}^{-1}$ from the Northern sky in the energy range $E\gtrsim 50$~TeV. The number of doublets and triplets identified in this search is compatible with the atmospheric background hypothesis, which leads us to set limits on the nature of neutrino transient sources with emission timescales of one month.","['R.

A long-term study of Mrk 50 : Appearance and disappearance of soft excess,"We present an extensive temporal and spectral study of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 50 using 15 years (2007-2022) of multiwavelength observations from XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR for the first time. From the timing analysis, we found that the source exhibited variability of $\sim$20 % during the 2007 observation, which reduced to below 10 % in the subsequent observations and became non-variable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we found that the spectra are nearly featureless. Non-detection of absorption in the low-energy domain during the 15 years of observation infers the absence of obscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a `bare' type. A prominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum during the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later observations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical models, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk. Both the physical models explain the nature and origin of the soft excess in this source. Our analysis found that Mrk~50 accretes at sub-Eddington accretion rate ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.13-0.02$) during all the observations used in this work.","['Narendranath Layek', 'Prantik Nandi', 'Sachindra Naik', 'Arghajit Jana']",11.0,27.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09300,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,APJ,,['galaxies: active – galaxies: Individual: Mrk 50 – galaxies: nuclei – galax ies: Seyfert – X-rays: galaxies 1'],2025-01-17
Exploring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Isotopic Ratios of Supernova Nucleosynthesis Products in Presolar Grains,"We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) neutrino-flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La or $^6$Li/$^7$Li and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from core-collapse supernovae could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell-model and the model of quasi-particle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, $\nu+^{16}$O, $\nu+^{20}$Ne, and $\nu+^{138}$Ba are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated $^{7}$Li/$^{6}$Li ratio by a factor of five compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers where $^{138}$La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of $^{10,11}$B and $^{6,7}$Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La and $^6$Li/$^7$Li vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.","['Xingqun Yao', 'Toshitaka Kajino', 'Yudong Luo', 'Takehito Hayakawa', 'Toshio Suzuki', 'Heamin Ko', 'Myung-Ki Cheoun', 'Seiya Hayakawa', 'Hidetoshi Yamaguchi', 'Silvio Cherubini']",4.0,21.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09329,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,[],2025-01-17
Long-term Simultaneous Monitoring Observations of SiO and H2O Masers toward the Mira Variable WX Serpentis,"We present the results from long-term simultaneous monitoring observations of SiO and H2O masers toward the Mira variable star WX Serpentis. This study has been conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network from 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.","['Jang-Ho Lim', 'Jaeheon Kim', 'Se-Hyung Cho', 'Hyosun Kim', 'Dong-Hwan Yoon', 'Seong-Min Son', 'Kyung-Won Suh']",10.0,24.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09369,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,"The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 275:20 (24pp), 2024 December",['Silicon monoxide masers (1458 )'],2025-01-17
Structure formation in O-type stars and Wolf-Rayet stars,"Turbulent small-scale structures in the envelopes and winds of massive stars have long been suggested as the cause for excessive line broadening that could not be explained by other mechanisms such as thermal broadening. However, the origin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been extensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified stellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Particularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is consistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin of this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick envelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could drive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear simulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and tracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the analytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to two possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic instability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different instabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the growth rate $\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct $\omega \sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra analysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather increases with $k$ - tentatively as $\omega \sim \sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest that structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop from the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible with either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains inconclusive for now.","['Cassandra Van der Sijpt', 'Jon Sundqvist', 'Dwaipayan Debnath', 'Florian Driessen', 'Nicolas Moens']",4.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09378,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Stars: massive – Methods: analytical - Methods: numerical - Hydrodynamics - Instabilities - Turbulence 1'],2025-01-17

Void spin distribution as a powerful probe of $\sigma_{8}$,"We present a numerical proof of the concept that the void spin distributions can in principle provide a tight constraint on the amplitude of matter density fluctuation on the scale of $8\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ ($\sigma_{8}$) without being severely deteriorated by the degeneracies of $\sigma_{8}$ with cold dark matter density parameter multiplied by the dimensionless Hubble parameter square ($\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$), total neutrino mass ($M_{\nu}$) and dark energy equation of state ($w$). Applying the Void-Finder algorithm to a total of $15$ AbacusSummit $N$-body simulations of $15$ different cosmological models, we identify the giant voids to measure their spins, defined as the magnitudes of rescaled specific angular momenta of void halos. The $15$ cosmologies include the Planck $\Lambda$CDM and $14$ non-Planck models, each of which differs among one another only in one of $\{\sigma_{8},\ \Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2},\ M_{\nu},\ w\}$. The probability density distribution of void spins is determined for each model and found to be well approximated by the generalized Gamma distribution with two characteristic parameters, $k$ and $\theta$. It turns out that the best-fit values of $k$ and $\theta$ exhibit very sensitive dependences only on $\sigma_{8}$, being almost insensitive to $\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$, $M_{\nu}$, $w$. This exclusive $\sigma_{8}$-dependence of the void spin distributions is confirmed to be robust against the variation of the mass and number cuts of void halos. We also test an observational feasibility of estimating the void spins from real data on the galaxy redshifts.","['Geonwoo Kang', 'Jounghun Lee']",12.0,21.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09476,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-17

Spectro-polarimetry of GRB 180427A: evidence for distinct emission sites with varying polarisation,"The dynamics of the origin of gamma-ray emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an enigma. Through a joint analysis of GRB 180427A, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AstroSat's Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager, we identify emissions from two distinct regions with varying polarisation properties. Time-resolved polarisation analysis reveals a synchronous evolution of the polarisation angle (PA) and fraction (PF) with two emission pulses, peaking with a delay of $4.82 \pm 0.12\, \mathrm{s}$. Spectral analysis indicates that the first pulse is dominated by blackbody radiation, while the second pulse exhibits a non-thermal spectrum (power law with an exponential cutoff). Using a bottom-to-top approach through simulations, we decouple the polarisation properties of the individual spectral components, revealing polarisation fractions of 25\% - 40\% for the blackbody spectrum and 30\% - 60\% for the non-thermal spectrum. At a redshift of $z \sim 0.05$, the blackbody emission originates from the jet photosphere at $10^{11}\, \mathrm{cm}$, whereas the non-thermal emission arises from an optically thin region at $10^{15}\, \mathrm{cm}$. The changing dominance of these emissions explains the observed PA shift of $60^\circ \pm 22.3^\circ$. The spectral cutoff at 1 MeV suggests pair opacity due to the jet's low bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim$ tens). The high polarisation and hard spectral slopes ($\alpha > -0.5$) imply a top-hat jet structure observed off-axis, near the jet's edge. This off-axis viewing introduces anisotropy in the radiation within the viewing cone ($1/\Gamma$), accounting for the observed polarisation.","['Rushikesh Sonawane', 'Shabnam Iyyani', 'Soumya Gupta', 'Tanmoy Chattopadhyay', 'Dipankar Bhattacharya', 'Varun.

On the robustness of exoplanet atmospheric detections: insights from extensive simulations,"The classical picture of our Solar System being the archetypal outcome of planet formation has been rendered obsolete by the astonishing diversity of extrasolar-system architectures. From rare hot-Jupiters to abundant super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, most detected exoplanets have no analogs in our system, and their interior and atmospheric compositions remain largely unknown. Fortunately, new methodologies enable us to analyze exoplanet atmospheres, inferring their compositions, temperatures, dynamics, and even formation pathways. Specifically, ground-based high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy (HRDS) can disentangle spectral-line profiles of weak exo-atmospheric signals from the dominating features of Earth's atmosphere in the observed flux. For over a decade, HRDS has focused on hot Jupiters (close-orbiting gas giants) due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, which makes them ideal laboratories for advancing our knowledge. However, there have been concerns regarding potential biases in exo-atmospheric-detection methods, hindering comparative planetology. Here we propose a modeling framework based on extensive simulations of HRDS exo-atmospheric observations to systematically explore in-silico underlying biases in commonly-used pipelines, particularly under the presence of observational noise. Our findings show that exo-atmospheric detection-significances are highly contingent on details of the analysis-pipeline used, with different techniques responding differently to noise: A given technique may fail to recover a true-signal that is detected by another. Noise effects in the computed significances are non-trivial and pipeline-dependent. Statistical analyses provide a complementary tool to contextualize signal-significances, which will gain in relevance as we move towards studying the atmospheres of smaller, potentially habitable exoplanets with even weaker signals.","['A.

Resolving the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation among Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Evidence for AGN-driven Hierarchical Mergers,"The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation vanishes for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation likely originating from hierarchical mergers. The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function cuts off at $\sim 45M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2}=0.35^{+0.18}_{-0.22}$, consistent with the expectation of hierarchical mergers formed in the disks of active galactic nucleus (AGNs). We infer $\mu_{\chi,2}>0$ at 98.7\% credible level, and a symmetric $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the second subpopulation is disfavored by $\mathcal{B}\sim5$. However, negative values of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are also measured, indicating that the hierarchical mergers may take place within both star clusters and AGN disks. We find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ for two distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions relative to single $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution that conditioned on mass ratios. Therefore we conclude that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the entire population can be explained as the superposition of two subpopulations. Additionally, we suggest to use a flexible mass function to reduce the bias in $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation that may be introduced by model mis-specification.","['Yin-Jie Li', 'Yuan-Zhu Wang', 'Shao-Peng Tang', 'Tong Chen', 'Yi-Zhong Fan']",7.0,13.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09495,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Binary Black Holes'],2025-01-17
Populations of Neutron Star Ultraluminous X-ray Sources: Mind your b's and B's,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with neutron star (NS) accretors challenge traditional accretion models, and have sparked a debate regarding the role of geometrical beaming and strong magnetic fields (B). The reduction of the Thomson cross-section in the presence of strong B, leads to a modification of the Eddington limit, and therefore is expected to affect significantly the observational appearance of NS-ULXs. We investigate the role of this modification using population synthesis models, and explore its effects on the X-ray luminosity functions, spin-up rates, and outflow energetics of the observed NS-ULXs. Our results show that the new prescription allows NS-ULXs to achieve super-Eddington luminosities with milder beaming compared to before, improving the agreement with observations. In addition, it broadens the range of spin-up rates allowing for more diverse conditions in NS-ULXs in terms of accretion rates and magnetic fields. More importantly, the reduced beaming increases the likelihood of observing the NS-ULXs within wind-powered nebulae such as NGC 5907 ULX-1. Our findings highlight the necessity of taking into account B effects independently of the approach: geometrical beaming or strong B, and call for magnetospheric accretion prescriptions that can be integrated in population synthesis codes.","['Konstantinos Kovlakas', 'Devina Misra', 'Roberta Amato', 'Gian Luca Israel']",3.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09526,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters,,"['accretion disks — X-rays: binaries — Magnetic fields — Stars: evolution — Stars: neutron — Stars: black holes 1', 'Accretion']",2025-01-17
WALLABY Pilot Survey & ASymba: Comparing HI Detection Asymmetries to the SIMBA Simulation,"An avenue for understanding cosmological galaxy formation is to compare morphometric parameters in observations and simulations of galaxy assembly. In this second paper of the ASymba: Asymmetries of HI in SIMBA Galaxies series, we measure atomic gas HI asymmetries in spatially-resolved detections from the untargetted WALLABY survey, and compare them to realizations of WALLABY-like mock samples from the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We develop a Scanline Tracing method to create mock galaxy HI datacubes which minimizes shot noise along the spectral dimension compared to particle-based methods, and therefore spurious asymmetry contributions. We compute 1D and 3D asymmetries for spatially-resolved WALLABY Pilot Survey detections, and find that the highest 3D asymmetries A3D>0.5 stem from interacting systems or detections with strong bridges or tails. We then construct a series of WALLABY-like mock realizations drawn from the SIMBA 50 Mpc simulation volume, and compare their asymmetry distributions. We find that the incidence of high A3D detections is higher in WALLABY than in the SIMBA mocks, but that difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.05). The statistical power of quantitative comparisons of asymmetries such as the one presented here will improve as the WALLABY survey progresses, and as simulation volumes and resolutions increase.","['Mathieu Perron-Cormier', 'Nathan Deg', 'Kristine Spekkens', 'Mark L.

A stellar census in globular clusters with MUSE. Metallicity spread and dispersion among first-population stars,"Multiple populations are ubiquitous in the old massive globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. It is still unclear how they arose during the formation of a GC. The topic of iron and metallicity variations has recently attracted attention with the measurement of iron variations among the primordial population (P1) stars of Galactic GCs. We use the spectra of more than 8000 RGB stars in 21 Galactic GCs observed with MUSE to derive individual stellar metallicities [M/H]. For each cluster, we use the HST photometric catalogs to separate the stars into two main populations (P1 and P2). We measure the metallicity spread within the primordial population of each cluster by combining our metallicity measurements with the stars $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color. We also derive metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) for the P1 and P2 stars of each GC. In all but three GCs, we measure a significant correlation between the metallicity and the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ pseudo-color of the P1 stars such that stars with larger $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ have higher metallicities. We measure metallicity spreads that range from 0.03 to 0.24 dex and correlate with the GC masses. As for the intrinsic metallicity dispersions, when combining the P1 and P2 stars, we measure values ranging from 0.02 dex to 0.08 dex that correlate very well with the GC masses. We compared the metallicity dispersion among the P1 and P2 stars and found that the P2 stars have metallicity dispersions that are smaller or equal to that of the P1 stars. We find that both the metallicity spreads of the P1 stars (from the $\Delta_{\rm F275W,F814W}$ spread in the chromosome maps) and the metallicity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm [M/H]}$) correlate with the GC masses, as predicted by some theoretical self-enrichment models presented in the literature.","['M.

Velocity fields and turbulence from cosmic filaments to galaxy clusters,"Galaxy clusters are currently the endpoint of the hierarchical structure formation; they form via the accretion of dark matter and cosmic gas from their local environment. In particular, filaments contribute grandly by accreting gas from cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions and feeding it to the galaxy clusters. Along the way, the gas in filaments is shocked and heated, which, together with the velocity structure within the filament, induces swirling and, thus, turbulence. In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical simulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in the two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high resolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted from the simulation. We study the temperature, the velocity field, and derived quantities in longitudinal cuts to study the general structure of the filaments and in transverse cuts to study their inner organisation and connection to cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions. Then, we conduct a quantitative study of velocities in Virgo's filaments by computing the 2D energy spectrum from 1 and 5~Mpc square maps extracted from the slices and centred on the core of the filaments. We show that the velocity field goes from mostly compressive far in the filaments to mostly solenoidal in Virgo's core. Moreover, we observe that the total energy spectrum in the filaments gains in amplitude and steepens towards Virgo.","['Théo Lebeau', 'Saleem Zaroubi', 'Nabila Aghanim', 'Jenny G.

An Intermediate-mass Black Hole Lurking in A Galactic Halo Caught Alive during Outburst,"Stellar-mass and supermassive black holes abound in the Universe, whereas intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of ~10^2-10^5 solar masses in between are largely missing observationally, with few cases found only. Here we report the real-time discovery of a long-duration X-ray transient, EP240222a, accompanied by an optical flare with prominent H and He emission lines revealed by prompt follow-up observations. Its observed properties evidence an IMBH located unambiguously in the halo of a nearby galaxy and flaring by tidally disrupting a star -- the only confirmed off-nucleus IMBH-tidal disruption event so far. This work demonstrates the potential of sensitive time-domain X-ray surveys, complemented by timely multi-wavelength follow-ups, in probing IMBHs, their environments, demographics, origins and connections to stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.","['C.-C.

New Methods of Identifying AGN in the Early Universe using Spectroscopy and Photometry in the JWST Era,"We explore spectroscopic and photometric methods for identifying high-redshift galaxies containing an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with JWST observations. After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII $\lambda$1640, OIII] $\lambda$1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII $\lambda$4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII $\lambda$1640 and CIII] / HeII $\lambda$1640, as well as the EW of HeII $\lambda$1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII $\lambda$1640 and OIII] $\lambda$1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII $\lambda$1640/H$\beta$ ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at $z > 6$. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.","['Flor Arevalo Gonzalez', 'Titanilla Braun', 'James Trussler', 'Christopher J.

The White Dwarf Pareto: Tracing Mass Loss in Binary Systems,"The white dwarf mass distribution has been studied primarily at two extremes: objects that presumably evolved as single stars and members of close binaries that likely underwent substantial interaction. This work considers the intermediate separation regime of ~1 au and demonstrates how binary interaction affects white dwarf masses. The binary mass ratio distribution is utilized for this purpose. Modeled as a truncated Pareto profile, this distribution provides insights into the populations' properties and evolutionary history. When applied to homogeneous samples of binaries with giant primaries of similar age, the distribution's shape constrains the fraction of white dwarf companions, the white dwarf mass distribution, and the properties of their progenitors. As a test case, this method is applied to a small spectroscopic sample of binaries in open clusters with red giant primaries and orbital periods between 0.5 and 20 years. The analysis reveals that white dwarfs in these systems are ~20% less massive than their isolated counterparts, with a typical mass of ~0.55 Msun. Their progenitors likely lost 80-85% of their mass, with binary interactions enhancing mass loss by an additional ~0.2 Msun. These findings highlight the utility of this approach for studying binary evolution and improving population models, particularly with future datasets from Gaia and other large-scale surveys.",['Sahar Shahaf'],8.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09586,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ,,['White dwarf stars (1799) — Red giant stars (1372) — Binary stars (154) — Spectroscopic binary stars (1557) — Mass ratio (1012) — Astrostatistics (1882) 1'],2025-01-17
Constraints on Cosmic Rays Acceleration in Bright Gamma-ray Bursts with Observations of Fermi,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely suggested as potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The kinetic energy of the jets dissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of $\gamma$-ray photons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons will interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and Bethe-Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This process can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray regime. The expected $\gamma$-ray flux from cascades depends on properties of the GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius $R_{\rm diss}$, the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, and the baryon loading factor $\eta_p$. Therefore, observations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters. In this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV-MeV fluence and constrain the baryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor and the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings indicate a strong constraint of $\eta_p<10$ for most selected GRBs over a large parameter space except for large dissipation radii ($\gtrsim 10^{15}\rm cm$) and high bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 600$). The constraint is comparable to, and in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for stacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for typical bulk Lorentz factor of several hundreds, the dissipation radii of GRBs need be large to avoid overshooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs, which can be used to constrain GRBs.","['Xing-Fu Zhang', 'Ruo-Yu Liu', 'Hai-Ming Zhang', 'Yi-Yun Huang', 'B.

The NuSTAR view of five changing-look active galactic nuclei,"Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) are known to change their spectral type between 1 and 2 (changing-state) or change their absorption between Compton-thick and Compton-thin (changing-obscuration) on timescales of years or less. The physical mechanism and possible connection between the two types of CLAGNs are still unclear. We explore the evolution of the broadband X-ray spectra from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (\nustar\,) and column density in five CLAGNs with moderate inclination viewing angles, which have shown significant variations of both optical types and X-ray absorption. Based on a phenomenological and two clumpy torus models, we find that the X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington-scaled X-ray $2-10$ keV luminosity ($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$) are positively correlated for the five sources, which are similar to other bright AGNs and optical CLAGNs at type 1 phase. We find a significant negative correlation between log$N_\mathrm{H,los}$ and log$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ except for ESO 362-G18. Similar to changing-state AGNs, changing-obscuration AGNs may be also triggered by the evolution of the accretion disc. Our results support the disc wind scenario, where the disc wind proportional to the accretion rate and formed at moderate inclination angles would push the obscuration material further away and decrease the column density from the line of sight observed in the changing-look AGNs.","['Bing Lyu', 'Zhen Yan', 'Xue-bing Wu', 'Qingwen Wu', 'Wenfei Yu', 'Hao Liu']",5.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09602,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['e', 'X-rays: galaxies – galaxies: nuclei – galaxies:Seyfert –accretion 1 INTRODUCTION An Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy', 'which is powered by the material accreting onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH']",2025-01-17
Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to an isocurvature field,"The Chern-Simons gravitational term during inflation is usually coupled to the inflaton field. The resulting theory suffers from ghost-field formation in the tensor sector, which limits the observational effects of P-violation on cosmological correlators. In this work, we consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to an isocurvature component in a multi-field model of inflation. Since the resulting theory does not affect the quadratic action of tensor perturbations, ghost fields do not appear. This operator provides (P-violating) interactions between the isocurvature perturbation and the curvature and tensor perturbations. We show that combining these couplings with interactions between the curvature and isocurvature components coming from a turning trajectory, the resulting $\langle sst \rangle_{PV}$ non-Gaussianities can reach $f^{sst, PV}_{\rm NL}=B_{PV}^{\zeta\zeta h}(k,k,k)/P^2_{\zeta}(k)\sim \mathcal O(1)$ within the parameter space of the theory.

Planetary Rhythms: Synchronous Circulation on Variably Irradiated Asynchronous Planets,"Tidal locking of planets to their host stars results in an atmospheric circulation with a hotspot fixed to the frame of reference of the planet. On the other hand, asynchronously rotating planets feature moving hotspots either lagging or leading the corresponding substellar point as it translates along the surface. We show that a planet falling in the latter category could mimic the circulation of tidally synchronous planets under the influence of time-varying instellation, possibly provided by pulsating or multiple star systems. This happens when the planets diurnal period is in resonance with the period of instellation variation, leading to a planet-frame-fixed hotspot. Slight differences in the above periods lead to East-West or West-East creeping hotspots with a period significantly longer than both. The rate of hotspot motion is given by the difference between the diurnal and instellation variation rates, similar to the lower envelope frequency of beat patterns formed by two superposed waves in linear wave theory. We call this phenomenon beating. A combination of the radiative, rotational, wave propagation, and drag timescales establishes dynamical constraints on beating. Based on this we classify a set of Kepler and TESS circumbinary planets with two candidates exhibiting climatic departures from the no-variation scenario. In general, hotter and faster-spinning planets are more susceptible to climatic departures. Beating, if it occurs, may additionally create optimistic extensions of habitable zones for corresponding systems.",['Deepayan Banik'],6.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09644,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Atmospheric dynamics(2300) — Variable irradiation(xxx) — Tidally synchronous(xxxx) — Hotspot(xxxx) — Exoplanet atmospheres(487) 1'],2025-01-17
SHORES: Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources with the ATCA.

Simulations determined that our procedure and final catalog is 95% reliable above $497.5\, \mu$Jy and $95\%$ complete to the $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$ significance level. By exploiting ATCA E-W 6 km configuration we reached resolutions of $3.2\times 7.2$ arcsec, to which level $81\%$ of our sources are unresolved.

Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution,"We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.","['Ron Schreier', 'Shlomi Hillel', 'Noam Soker']",8.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09663,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['(stars:) binaries (including multiple): close'],2025-01-17
Unveiling the origin of XMM-Newton soft proton flares: I. Design and validation of a response matrix for proton spectral analysis,"Low-energy (<300 keV) protons entering the field of view of XMM-Newton are observed in the form of a sudden increase in the background level, the so-called soft proton flares, affecting up to 40% of the mission observing time. In-flight XMM-Newton's observations of soft protons represent a unique laboratory to validate and improve our understanding of their interaction with the mirror, optical filters, and X-ray instruments. At the same time, such models would link the observed background flares to the primary proton population encountered by the telescope, converting XMM-Newton into a monitor for soft protons. We built a Geant4 simulation of XMM-Newton, including a verified mass model of the X-ray mirror, the focal plane assembly, and the EPIC MOS and pn-CCDs. We encoded the energy redistribution and proton transmission efficiency into a redistribution matrix file (RMF) and an auxiliary response file (ARF). For the validation, three averaged soft proton spectra, one for each filter configuration, were extracted from a collection of 13 years of MOS observations of the focused non X-ray background and analysed with Xspec.

25 years of XMM-Newton observations of the Sgr A complex: 3D distribution and internal structure of the clouds,"Sgr A* is currently very faint. However, X-ray radiation reflected by the Sgr A complex, a group of nearby molecular clouds, suggests that it went through one or more periods of high activity some hundreds of years ago. We aim to determine whether previously proposed physical scenarios are consistent with the observed X-ray variability over the past 25 years, and to characterize the spatial distribution, shape, and internal structure of the clouds. We exploit the full set of XMM-Newton observations, extending the previously studied dataset on variability by at least 12 years. Starting from the recent IXPE result that places the so-called Bridge cloud 26 pc behind Sgr A*, we reconstruct the LOS position of the other clouds, assuming that they were illuminated by a single flare. Additionally, we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the molecular density. We also study the 3D geometry of the complex in case two flares illuminate the clouds. As of spring 2024, the lightfront is still illuminating the Sgr A complex, with the Bridge currently being the brightest cloud. The other clouds in the complex have faded significantly. In the single flare scenario, the Sgr A complex is located $\simeq$ 25 pc behind Sgr A*. In the past 25 years, the illuminated region spans 10-15 pc along the LOS. The derived PDF is roughly log-normal, consistent with previous Chandra results, with a possible high-density excess. Both a single and a multiple flares scenario can explain the observed X-ray variability. Previous concerns about the single flare scenario, raised by shorter monitoring, are now overcome in the 25 years of monitoring. If two flares illuminate the clouds, they must be separated by at least $\sim$ 30 years. We speculate that these clouds are closer to Sgr A* than the nuclear molecular ring at $\simeq$ 100-200 pc and possibly drifting from the ring to the inner region of the Galaxy.","['G. Stel', 'G.

Stellar occultation observations of (38628) Huya and its satellite: a detailed look into the system,"The physical and orbital parameters of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) provide valuable information about the Solar System's formation and evolution. In particular, the characterization of binaries provides insights into the formation mechanisms that may be playing a role at such large distances from the Sun. Studies show two distinct populations, and (38628) Huya occupies an intermediate position between the unequal-size binaries and those with components of roughly equal sizes. In this work, we predicted and observed three stellar occultation events by Huya. Huya and its satellite - S/2012 (38628) 1 - were detected during occultations in March 2021 and again in June 2023. Additionally, an attempt to detect Huya in February 2023 resulted in an additional single-chord detection of the secondary. A spherical body with a minimum diameter of D = 165 km can explain the three single-chord observations and provide a lower limit for the satellite size. The astrometry of Huya's system, as derived from the occultations and supplemented by observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Observatory, provided constraints on the satellite orbit and the mass of the system. Therefore, assuming the secondary is in an equatorial orbit around the primary, the limb fitting was constrained by the satellite orbit position angle. The system density, calculated by summing the most precise measurement of Huya's volume to the spherical satellite average volume, is $\rho_{1}$ = 1073 $\pm$ 66 kg m$^{-3}$. The density that the object would have assuming a Maclaurin equilibrium shape with a rotational period of 6.725 $\pm$ 0.01 hours is $\rho_{2}$ = 768 $\pm$ 42 kg m$^{-3}$. This difference rules out the Maclaurin equilibrium assumption for the main body shape.","['F. L. Rommel', 'E. Fernández-Valenzuela', 'B. C. N. Proudfoot', 'J. L. Ortiz', 'B. E. Morgado', 'B.

PyPLUTO: a data analysis Python package for the PLUTO code,"In recent years, numerical simulations have become indispensable for addressing complex astrophysical problems. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework represents a key tool for investigating the dynamical evolution of astrophysical plasmas, which are described as a set of partial differential equations that enforce the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with Maxwell's equation for the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code (Mignone et al., 2007; Mignone et al., 2012). PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. PyPLUTO also supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling users to load and visualize particles, such as cosmic rays (Mignone et al., 2018), Lagrangian (Vaidya et al., 2018), or dust (Mignone et al., 2019) particles, from hybrid simulations. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) simplifies the generation of single-subplot figures, making PyPLUTO a powerful yet user-friendly toolkit for astrophysical data analysis.","['Giancarlo Mattia', 'Daniele Crocco', 'David Melon Fuksman', 'Matteo Bugli', 'Vittoria Berta', 'Eleonora Puzzoni', 'Andrea Mignone', 'Bhargav Vaidya']",3.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09748,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,JOSS,"Phys.

MUSE observations of V1425 Aql reveal an arc-shaped nova shell,"Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.","['L. Celedón', 'C. Tappert', 'L. Schmidtobreick', 'F.

Evolution of SMBHs in light of PTA measurements: implications for growth by mergers and accretion,"We study the growth of supermassive black holes accounting for both accretion and mergers. The former is informed by observations of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and the latter by the gravitational wave-background (GWB) recently detected by PTAs, while estimates of the present-day black hole mass function provide a boundary condition. The GWB is dominated by the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\odot}$). We show that their evolution can be simplified into a two-step process: mergers dominate at $z\leq1$, while accretion peaks at $1.4\leq z\leq2$. The large amplitude of the observed GWB suggests a significant number of mergers. We show that this generically implies a higher average Eddington ratio for quasars relative to a scenario in which mergers are negligible. In the absence of mergers, matching local estimates of BH abundance to the QLF implies a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_r=0.12$ and Eddington ratio $\lambda=0.2$. With mergers, a progenitor of mass $M_i$ is boosted to a final total mass $M_f$ and there is a direct relation between the mass gained in mergers and the average Eddington ratio of the quasar population, given by $M_f/M_i\sim\lambda/0.2$. There is thus a tension between the observed GWB, quasar properties, and the BH mass function: estimates of the mass function consistent with Eddington ratios inferred in quasars and $\epsilon_r\sim0.1$ underpredict the GWB; multiple/equal mass mergers can boost the GWB, but lead to a high Eddington ratio. If the local mass function is on the high end of current estimates, the GWB is more readily explained, but requires low efficiencies $\epsilon_r\sim10^{-2}$ not expected in standard luminous accretion models. The significant merger rate implied by the GWB also strongly suggests that the most massive BHs in the local universe have significant spin due to the orbital angular momentum from mergers, perhaps $a\sim0.5$.","['Gabriela Sato-Polito', 'Matias Zaldarriaga', 'Eliot Quataert']",8.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09786,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,[],2025-01-20
Detecting dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory,"Numerous observations confirm the existence of dark matter (DM) at astrophysical and cosmological scales. Theory and simulations of galaxy formation predict that DM should cluster on small scales in bound structures called sub-halos or DM clumps. While the most massive DM sub-halos host baryonic matter, less massive, unpopulated sub-halos could be abundant in the Milky Way (MW), as well and yield high-energy gamma rays as final products of DM annihilation. Recently, it has been highlighted that the brightest halos should also have a sizeable extension in the sky. In this study, we examine the prospects offered by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray instrument, for detecting and characterizing such objects. Previous studies have primarily focused on high-latitude observations; here, we assess the potential impact of the CTAO's Galactic Plane Survey, which will provide unprecedentedly deep survey data for the inner five degrees of the Galactic plane. Our modeling accounts for tidal effects on the sub-halo population, examining the conditions under which DM sub-halos can be detected and distinguished from conventional astrophysical sources. We find that regions a few degrees above or below the Galactic plane offer the highest likelihood for DM sub-halo detection. For an individual sub-halo -- the brightest from among various realizations of the MW subhalo population -- we find that detection at the 5$\sigma$ level is achievable for an annihilation cross section of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 3\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV-scale DM annihilating into $b\bar{b}$. For a full population study, depending on the distribution and luminosity model of Galactic sub-halos, yet unconstrained cross sections in the range $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-23}-10^{-22}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV DM candidates are necessary for the brightest sub-halos to be detected.","['Christopher Eckner', 'Veronika Vodeb', 'Tejas Satheesh', 'Francesca Calore', 'Moritz Hütten', 'Pierrick Martin', 'Gabrijela Zaharijas']",10.0,24.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09789,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-20
Star-Forming Nuclear Clusters in Dwarf Galaxies Mimicking AGN Signatures in the Mid-Infrared,"Effectively finding and identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is an important step in studying black hole formation and evolution. In this work, we examine four mid-IR-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between $M_\star \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$ , and find that the galaxies are host to nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that are notably rare in how young and massive they are. We perform photometric measurements on the central star clusters in our target galaxies galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR imaging and compare their observed properties to models of stellar population evolution. We find that these galaxies are host to very massive ($\sim10^7 M_\odot$), extremely young ($\lesssim 8$ Myr), dusty ($0.6 \lesssim \mathrm{A_v} \lesssim 1.8$) nuclear star clusters. Our results indicate that these galactic nuclei have ongoing star-formation, are still at least partially obscured by clouds of gas and dust, and are most likely producing the extremely red AGN-like mid-IR colors. Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color-color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.","['Megan R.

Dust dynamics in radially convective regions of protoplanetary disks,"Hydrodynamic instabilities likely operate in protoplanetary disks. One candidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a negative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures are expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction between dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the unstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal flows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust densities increase at most by a factor of $O(10)$ over its background value due to the zonal flows' unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon \sim O(0.1)$. We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift towards pressure maxima. Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure gradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust concentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to $\epsilon \lesssim 1$. Whether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed with stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.","['Min-Kai Lin', 'Marius Lehmann']",24.0,22.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09792,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-20
Cepheids in spectroscopic binary systems -- current status and recent discoveries,"We present a summary of the current knowledge about Cepheids in binary systems. We focus on the most recent findings and discoveries, such as the highly increasing number of confirmed and candidate spectroscopic binary Cepheids and the progress in determining their physical parameters. This includes new and newly analyzed binary Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We will provide an update on the project to increase the number of the most valuable Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to more than 100. To date, we have confirmed 60 SB2 systems, including detecting a significant orbital motion for 37. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest period reported before and systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past binary interactions, including merger events). Both features are essential to understanding how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and how this influences global Cepheid properties. We will also present nine new systems composed of two Cepheids.

11 New Transiting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars from TESS,"We present the discovery of 11 new transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs from NASA's TESS mission: TOI-2844, TOI-3122, TOI-3577, TOI-3755, TOI-4462, TOI-4635, TOI-4737, TOI-4759, TOI-5240, TOI-5467, and TOI-5882. They consist of 5 brown dwarf companions and 6 very low mass stellar companions ranging in mass from $25 M_{\rm J}$ to $128 M_{\rm J}$. We used a combination of photometric time-series, spectroscopic, and high resolution imaging follow-up as a part of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) in order to characterize each system. With over 50 transiting brown dwarfs confirmed, we now have a large enough sample to directly test different formation and evolutionary scenarios. We provide a renewed perspective on the transiting brown dwarf desert and its role in differentiating between planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Our analysis of the eccentricity distribution for the transiting brown dwarf sample does not support previous claims of a transition between planetary and stellar formation at $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$. We also contribute a first look into the metallicity distribution of transiting companions in the range $7 - 150$ $M_{\rm J}$, showing that this too does not support a $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$ transition. Finally, we also detect a significant lithium absorption feature in one of the brown dwarf hosts (TOI-5882) but determine that the host star is likely old based on rotation, kinematic, and photometric measurements. We therefore claim that TOI-5882 may be a candidate for planetary engulfment.","['Noah Vowell', 'Joseph E. Rodriguez', 'David W. Latham', 'Samuel N. Quinn', 'Jack Schulte', 'Jason D.

Kinematically induced dipole anisotropy in line-emitting galaxy number counts and line intensity maps,"The motion of the solar system against an isotropic radiation background, such as the cosmic microwave background, induces a dipole anisotropy in the background due to the Doppler effect. Flux-limited observation of the continuum radiation from galaxies also has been studied extensively to show a dipole anisotropy due to the Doppler effect and the aberration effect. We show that a similar dipole anisotropy exists in spectral-line intensity maps, represented as either galaxy number counts or the diffuse intensity maps. The amplitude of these dipole anisotropies is determined by not only the solar velocity against the large-scale structures but also the temporal evolution of the monopole (sky-average) component. Measuring the dipole at multiple frequencies, which have mutually independent origins due to their occurrence from multiple redshifts, can provide a very accurate measure of the solar velocity thanks to the redundant information. We find that such a measurement can even constrain astrophysical parameters in the nearby universe. We explore the potential for dipole measurement of existing and upcoming surveys, and conclude that the spectral number count of galaxies through SPHEREx will be optimal for the first measurement of the dipole anisotropy in the spectral-line galaxy distribution. LIM surveys with reasonable accuracy are also found to be promising. We also discuss whether these experiments might reveal a peculiar nature of our local universe, that seems to call for a non-standard cosmology other than the simple LambdaCDM model as suggested by recent measures of the baryon acoustic oscillation signatures and the Alcock-Paczynski tests.",['Kyungjin Ahn'],3.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09800,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['Sky S urveys 1', 'Cosmic microwave background', 'Cosmology', 'Dark energy']",2025-01-20
On the seismic modelling of subgiant stars: testing different grid interpolation methods,"Context. The emergence of mixed modes during the subgiant phase, whose frequencies are characterized by a fast evolution with age, can potentially enable a precise determination of stellar properties, a key goal for future missions like PLATO. However, current modelling techniques often consider grids that lack the resolution to properly account for the fast mode frequency evolution, consequently requiring the use of interpolation algorithms to cover the parameter space in between the grid models when applying model-data comparison methods. Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\ell$=1 mode frequencies within the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors ($\sim$0.1 $\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models. Methods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation algorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and different age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results. The best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines interpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central density $\rho_\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average, an absolute error of 0.14 $\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the interpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical observational errors. Furthermore, we investigated the impact on the accuracy of the interpolation from changes in the physical properties of the stars, showing, in particular, how the addition of core overshoot can affect significantly the interpolation results.","['Miguel Clara', 'Margarida S.

The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1,"Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$\% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $> 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. Using this information, we expect next-generation radio telescopes to detect a few dozen bursts per year at $z \gtrsim 6$. A radio telescope with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 1$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 14 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 200$ square degrees should be able to detect $1.4^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\times 10^3$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $234^{+250}_{-162}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.","['Om Gupta', 'Paz Beniamini', 'Pawan Kumar', 'Steven L.

Galaxy Morphological Classification with Zernike Moments and Machine Learning Approaches,"Classifying galaxies is an essential step for studying their structures and dynamics. Using GalaxyZoo2 (GZ2) fractions thresholds, we collect 545 and 11,735 samples in non-galaxy and galaxy classes, respectively. We compute the Zernike moments (ZMs) for GZ2 images, extracting unique and independent characteristics of galaxies. The uniqueness due to the orthogonality and completeness of Zernike polynomials, reconstruction of the original images with minimum errors, invariances (rotation, translation, and scaling), different block structures, and discriminant decision boundaries of ZMs' probability density functions for different order numbers indicate the capability of ZMs in describing galaxy features. We classify the GZ2 samples, firstly into the galaxies and non-galaxies and secondly, galaxies into spiral, elliptical, and odd objects (e.g., ring, lens, disturbed, irregular, merger, and dust lane). The two models include the support vector machine (SVM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), which use ZMs, compared with the other three classification models of 2D-CNN, ResNet50, and VGG16 that apply the features from original images. We find the true skill statistic (TSS) greater than 0.86 for the SVM and 1D-CNN with ZMs for the oversampled galaxy-non-galaxy classifier. The SVM with ZMs model has a high-performance classification for galaxy and non-galaxy datasets. We show that the SVM with ZMs, 1D-CNN with ZMs, and VGG16 with vision transformer are high-performance (accuracy larger than 0.90 and TSS greater than 0.86) models for classifying the galaxies into spiral, elliptical, and odd objects. We conclude that these machine-learning algorithms are helpful tools for classifying galaxy images.","['Hamed Ghaderi', 'Nasibe Alipour', 'Hossein Safari']",15.0,23.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09816,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Galaxy classification systems(582)'],2025-01-20
Dual-component stellar assembly histories in local elliptical galaxies via MUSE,"Elliptical galaxies often exhibit complex assembly histories, and are presumed to typically form through a combination of rapid, early star formation and subsequent accretion of material, often resulting from mergers with other galaxies. To investigate theories of spheroidal galaxy formation, the objective of this work is to analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of three isolated elliptical galaxies in the local Universe observed with MUSE at $z<0.06$. With BUDDI, we decompose the integral field unit (IFU) datacubes into two components with Sérsic profiles, which roughly correspond to the two phases of in-situ and ex-situ star formation. To constrain the mode of growth in these galaxies, we derived the mass and light-weighted stellar ages and metallicities, and created the 2D stellar population maps of each component using pPXF. We reconstructed the mass and light-weighted SFHs to constrain the contribution of different stellar populations to the mass and luminosity of the components through cosmic time. Our results show that the ellipticals in this sample have experienced an early and rapid phase of star formation either through a rapid dissipative collapse or gas-rich major mergers concentrated in the inner component, which contributes to $\sim50$% of the galaxy stellar mass. The co-dominant outer component, however, had assembled the bulk of its stellar mass shortly after the inner component did, through accretion via dry mergers and possible gas accretion. This premise is supported by our observations of the inner component being primarily composed of old and metal-rich stars. The outer component has a combination of old and intermediate-age stars, with a moderate spread in metallicities. These results are analysed through the lens of the two-phase scenario, a framework developed over the years to explain the formation histories of elliptical galaxies.","['Keerthana Jegatheesan', 'Evelyn J.

Observation of discontinuities in the periodic modulation of PSR B1828-11,"PSR B1828-11 is a radio pulsar that undergoes periodic modulations (~500 days) of its spin-down rate and beam width, providing a valuable opportunity to understand the rotational dynamics of neutron stars. The periodic modulations have previously been attributed to planetary companion(s), precession, or magnetospheric effects and have several interesting features: they persist over 10 cycles, there are at least two harmonically related components, and the period is decreasing at a rate of about 5 days per cycle. PSR B1828-11 also experienced a glitch, a sudden increase in its rotation frequency, at 55 040.9 Modified Julian Day(MJD). By studying the interaction of the periodic modulations with the glitch, we seek to find evidence to distinguish explanations of the periodic modulation. Using a phenomenological model, we analyse a recently published open data set from Jodrell Bank Observatory, providing the longest and highest resolution measurements of the pulsar's spin-down rate data. Our phenomenological model consists of step changes in the amplitude, modulation frequency, and phase of the long-term periodic modulation and the usual spin-down glitch behaviour. We find clear evidence with a (natural-log) Bayes factor of 1486 to support that not only is there a change to these three separate parameters but that the shifts occur before the glitch. Finally, we also present model-independent evidence which demonstrates visually how and when the modulation period and amplitude change. Discontinuities in the modulation period are difficult to explain if a planetary companion sources the periodic modulations, but we conclude with a discussion on the insights into precession and magnetospheric switching.","['Adriana Dias', 'Gregory Ashton', 'Julianna Ostrovska', 'David Ian Jones', 'Michael Keith']",9.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09834,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['PSR B1828 −11 – pulsars – glitches 1 INTRODUCTION Pulsars provide a unique astrophysical laboratory to probe physics at the extreme'],2025-01-20
"Chasing the Light: Shadowing, Collimation, and the Super-Eddington Growth of Infant Black Holes in JWST-Discovered AGNs","Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.",['Piero Madau'],8.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09854,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,[],2025-01-20
"So long Kolmogorov: the forward and backward turbulence cascades in a supernovae-driven, multiphase interstellar medium","The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is turbulent, and yet the fundamental nature of ISM turbulence, the energy cascade, is not understood in detail. In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of kinetic energy flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\mathbf{u}_c$ and incompressible $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\mathbf{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\mathbf{u}_s$ mode. But the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\mathbf{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction -- an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades happen on scales that have a power law $\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum, highlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical processes. We directly show that the inverse cascade comes from $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes interacting with expanding SNe remnants (SNRs) and that $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes are generated to leading order via baroclinic, highly corrugated cooling layers between warm $(T\lesssim 10^4\,\rm{K})$ and hot $(T\gg10^4\,\rm{K})$ gas in these SNRs. Finally, we outline a complete phenomenology for SNe-driven turbulence in a galactic disk, estimate a $10^{-16}\,\rm{G}$ Biermann field generated from SNR cooling layers, and highlight the strong deviations that SNe-driven turbulence has from the conventional Kolmogorov model.","['James R.

Similar-mass versus diverse-mass planetary systems in wind-driven accretion discs,"Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where neighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others, including the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution. Classical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the latter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies suggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than viscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate varies radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We investigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet formation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations via pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency via the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \lambda $ and studied outcomes by considering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our simulations show that higher $ \lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead to faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems. Lower $ \lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more diverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \lambda $ cases when planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is larger for lower $ \lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form more frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our simulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately separated at $ \lambda \sim 2\text{--}3 $.","['Yunpeng Zhao', 'Soko Matsumura']",13.0,16.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09882,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,Astronomy & Astrophysics (16 pages,,"['Methods: miscellaneous', 'Planets and satellites: formation', 'Protoplanetary disks', 'Accretion', 'Planets and satellites: general', 'Methods: numerical', 'accretion disks 1']",2025-01-20
Identification of 4876 Bent-Tail Radio Galaxies in the FIRST Survey Using Deep Learning Combined with Visual Inspection,"Bent-tail radio galaxies (BTRGs) are characterized by bent radio lobes. This unique shape is mainly caused by the movement of the galaxy within a cluster, during which the radio jets are deflected by the intra-cluster medium. A combined method, which involves a deep learning-based radio source finder along with visual inspection, has been utilized to search for BTRGs from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey images. Consequently, a catalog of 4876 BTRGs has been constructed, among which 3871 are newly discovered. Based on the classification scheme of the opening angle between the two jets of the galaxy, BTRGs are typically classified as either wide-angle-tail (WAT) sources or narrow-angle-tail (NAT) sources. Our catalog comprises 4424 WATs and 652 NATs. Among these, optical counterparts are identified for 4193 BTRGs. This catalog covers luminosities in the range of $1.91\times10^{20} \leq L_{\rm 1.4\,GHz} \leq 1.45\times10^{28}$ ${\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$ and redshifts from $z = 0.0023$ to $z = 3.43$. Various physical properties of these BTRGs and their statistics are presented.

Intensity Interferometer Results on Sirius with 0.25 m Telescopes,"We present the successful measurement of the squared visibility of Sirius at a telescope separation of 3.3 m using small 0.25 m Newtonian-style telescopes in an urban backyard setting. The primary science goal for small-scale intensity interferometers has been to measure the angular diameters of stars. Recent advances in low jitter time-tagging equipment and Single Photon Avalanche Detectors have made the detection of second-order photon correlation signals feasible with small low-cost telescopes. Using Sirius as a target star, we observe a photon count rate of $\sim$1.9 Mcps per detector with matched 1.2 nm wide filters at 589.3 nm and measured the spatial squared visibility at a telescope separation of 3.3 m to be $|V_{12}(3.3\text{m})|^2 = 0.94\pm0.16$. The measured detection significance is $\sim7 \sigma$ after 13.55 h of integration. The uncertainty in the measured visibility includes uncertainty in the instrument responsethis http URLsquared visibility agrees closely with the expected value of $0.94\pm0.01$. These results demonstrate that using small low-cost telescopes is feasible for intensity interferometry of bright stars. This enables a simple scaling in sensitivity by further realistic improvements in the instrument response jitter as well as increasing both the number of spectral bands and the number of telescopes towards systems capable of resolving objects such as quasars, white dwarfs, and galactic Cepheid variable stars.","['Thomas J.

Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy Merger: The Champagne Cluster,"We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for 103 member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We used cosmological simulations to find analogous systems to constrain the time since pericenter (74-250 Myr) and the angle the merger axis makes with the plane of the sky (62$^\circ$-90$^\circ$) at the 68$\%$ confidence level.

"Elliptical (E) and ellicular (ES) galaxies in the M_bh-M_*,sph diagram, and a merger-driven explanation for the origin of ES galaxies, anti-truncated stellar discs in lenticular galaxies, and the Sersicification of E galaxy light profiles","In a recent series of papers, supermassive black holes were used to discern pathways in galaxy evolution. By considering the black holes' coupling with their host galaxy's bulge/spheroid, the progression of mass within each component has shed light on the chronological sequence of galaxy speciation. Offsets between the galaxy-morphology-dependent M_bh-M_*,sph scaling relations trace a pattern of 'punctuated equilibrium' arising from merger-driven transitions between galaxy types, such as from spirals to dust-rich lenticulars and further to `ellicular' and elliptical galaxies. This study delves deeper into the distinction between the ellicular galaxies - characterised by their intermediate-scale discs - and elliptical galaxies. Along the way, it is shown how some anti-truncated large-scale discs in lenticular galaxies can arise from the coexistence of a steep intermediate-scale disc and a relatively shallow large-scale disc. This observation undermines application of the popular exponential-disc plus Sérsic-bulge model for lenticular galaxies and suggests some past bulge mass measurements have been overestimated. Furthermore, it is discussed how merger-driven disc-heating and blending likely leads to the spheroidalisation of discs and the conglomeration of multiple discs leads to the (high n) Sersicification of light profiles. The ellicular and elliptical galaxy distribution in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm\star,sph}$ diagram is explored relative to major-merger-built lenticular galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies. The (super-)quadratic $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm\star}$ relations, presented herein, for merger-built systems should aid studies of massive black hole collisions and the gravitational wave background. Finally, connections to dwarf compact elliptical and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, with their 100-1000 times higher $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm\star,sph}$ ratios, are presented.",['Alister W.

Unveiling the Interior Structure and Thermal Evolution of Super-Earth GJ 486b,"Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as ""super-Earths,"" are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.","['Chandan K.

Unveiling the nature of donor stars of ULXs in NGC 1559,"X-ray data provide insights into accretion processes and the compact objects of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), while optical and infrared (IR) observations help identify the donor star and surrounding environment. Together, these approaches shed light on the origins of the high X-ray luminosities observed in ULXs. This study examines the optical and infrared properties of eight ULXs in NGC 1559 using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To constrain the nature of the donor stars of the ULXs, photometric results were obtained from the temporal, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Furthermore, the long-term and spectral characteristics of only a ULX X-1 were investigated. ULX counterparts were determined from astrometric calculations. The long-term light curves and SEDs were constructed to interpret the origin of the optical and IR emissions. The masses and ages of donor star candidates were determined using CMDs. To constrain the mechanism of X-ray emission, the time-averaged spectrum and long-term light curve of the X-1 were obtained. Unique optical and IR counterparts for ULXs X-14 and X-24 were determined, while only optical counterparts were detected for X-1 and X-18. Our findings indicate that the optical emission originates from the donor stars of X-14 and X-24, whereas for X-1 and X-18, it is dominated by the accretion disk. In addition, the X-1 exhibits long-term X-ray variability spanning orders of magnitude.","['S. Allak', 'A.

An in-depth study of Gamma rays from the Starburst Galaxy M 82 with VERITAS,"Assuming Galactic cosmic rays originate in supernovae and the winds of massive stars, starburst galaxies should produce very-high-energy (VHE; E$>$100 GeV) gamma-ray emission via the interaction of their copious quantities of cosmic rays with the large reservoirs of dense gas within the galaxies. Such VHE emission was detected by VERITAS from the starburst galaxy M 82 in 2008-09. An extensive, multi-year campaign followed these initial observations, yielding a total of 254 h of good quality VERITAS data on M 82. Leveraging modern analysis techniques and the larger exposure, these VERITAS data show a more statistically significant VHE signal ($\sim$6.5 standard deviations ($\sigma$)). The corresponding photon spectrum is well fit by a power law ($\Gamma = 2.3 \pm 0.3_{stat} \pm0.2_{sys}$) and the observed integral flux is F($>$450 GeV) = $(3.2 \pm0.6_{stat} \pm 0.6_{sys}) \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}~s}^{-1}$, or $\sim$0.4\% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy threshold. The improved VERITAS measurements, when combined with various multi-wavelength data, enable modeling of the underlying emission and transport processes. A purely leptonic scenario is found to be a poor representation of the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). A lepto-hadronic scenario with cosmic rays following a power-law spectrum in momentum (index $s\simeq 2.25$), and with significant bremsstrahlung below $1$~GeV, provides a good match to the observed SED. The synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons indicates that efficient non-radiative losses of cosmic-ray electrons may be related to advective escape from the starburst core.","['Atreya Acharyya', 'Colin B.

Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface,"The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.","['Anne Virkki', 'Maxim Yurkin']",24.0,23.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10019,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Materials Science'],,,"['both in planetary and geo- sciences', ': Surface particles Discrete dipole approximation Radar PolyhedraABSTRACT Theelectromagnetic(EM)scatteringbynon-symmetricwavelength-scaleparticlesonaplanarsurface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies']",2025-01-20
Constraining the Nuclear Equation of State of neutron star via high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short gamma-ray bursts,"The determination of the equation of state (EOS) of a neutron star (NS) and its maximum mass is very important for understanding the formation and properties of NSs under extreme conditions, but they remain open questions. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the merger of binary NSs or giant flares (GFs) of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). Recently, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been claimed to be identified from two short GRBs (931101B and 910711). In this paper, we propose that the observed high-frequency QPOs in these two short GRBs result from torsional oscillations in the GFs of SGRs associated with cold NSs, or from radial oscillations of hypermassive NSs (HMNSs) as the hot remnants of binary NS mergers, and then to constrain the EOS of NSs. For torsional oscillations, the six selected EOSs (TM1, NL3, APR, SLy4, DDME2, and GM1) of NSs suitable for the zero-temperature condition exhibit significant overlap in mass ranges, suggesting that we cannot constrain the EOS of NSs. For radial oscillations, the six selected EOSs (IUF, TM1, TMA, FSG, BHBLp, and NL3) of NSs suitable for the high-temperature condition cannot be ruled out when redshift is considered. However, it is found that the EOS can only be constrained if the redshift and temperature of the remnant can be measured.","['Jun-Xiang Huang', 'Hou-Jun Lü', 'En-Wei Liang']",7.0,16.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10034,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-20
The role of dry mergers in shaping the scaling relations of galaxies,"In the context of the hierarchical formation of galaxies, we investigated the role played by mergers in shaping the scaling relations of galaxies, that is the projections of their Fundamental Plane onto the Ie-Re, Ie-Sigma, Ms-Re and L-Sigma planes. To this aim, based on the scalar Virial Theorem, we developed a simple theory of multiple dry mergers to read both the large scale simulations and the companion scaling relations. The aim was to compare the results of this approach with the observational data and with two of the most recent and detailed numerical cosmo-hydro-dynamical simulations, that is Illustris-TNG and EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments). We derived the above scaling relations for the galaxies of the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) and WINGS (Wide-field Imaging of Nearby Galaxy-Clusters Survey) databases and compared them with the observational data, the numerical simulations, and the results of our simple theory of dry mergers. The multiple dry merging mechanism is able to explain all the main characteristics of the observed scaling relations of galaxies, such as slopes, scatters, curvatures and zones of exclusion. The distribution of galaxies in these planes is continuously changing across time because of the merging activity and other physical processes, such as star formation, quenching, energy feedback, and so forth. The simple merger theory presented here yields the correct distribution of galaxies in the main scaling relations at all cosmic epochs. The precision is comparable with that obtained by the modern cosmo-hydro-dynamical simulations, with the advantage of providing a rapid exploratory response on the consequences engendered by different physical effects.","[""Mauro D'Onofrio"", 'Cesare Chiosi', 'Francesco Brevi']",18.0,20.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10047,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies formation and evolution – galaxies’ structure – sc aling relations 1'],2025-01-20

Disk in the circumstellar envelope of carbon Mira V Cygni,"AGB stars are the primary source of dust and complex molecules in the interstellar medium. The determination of outflow parameters is often hindered by the unknown geometry of the circumstellar environment, creating a demand for high-angular resolution observations. We use our NIR spectra and photometry of the carbon AGB star V Cyg, along with literature data, to construct its SED over a wide range of wavelengths. The dust envelope responsible for the IR excess was also resolved in scattered polarized light at angular scales of 50-80 mas using differential speckle polarimetry. We present an interpretation of the thermal and scattered radiation of the dust using models of a spherical dusty outflow (Mdust = 5.3e-7 M_sun) and an inclined equatorial density enhancement, either in the form of a disk (Mdust = 7.6e-3 M_earth) or a torus (Mdust = 5.7e-3 M_earth), which material is concentrated at stellocentric distances less than 25 AU. The dust material consists of amorphous carbon and SiC, with 84% of the dust being amorphous carbon. Dust particle radii range from 5 to 950 nm and follow a power law with an exponent of -3.5. Modeling of the envelope allowed us to improve the accuracy of stellar luminosity estimations: 21000 L_sun and 8300 L_sun at maximum and minimum brightness, respectively. The relation between the disk and the high water content in the envelope is also discussed.","['Boris S. Safonov', 'Sergey G. Zheltoukhov', 'Andrey M. Tatarnikov', 'Ivan A. Strakhov', 'Victor I.

Variabilities driven by satellite black hole migration in AGN discs,"The physical origin of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability remains unclear. Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection driven by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disc can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the co-moving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, the plasma, which is accelerated by the magnetic reconnection, will successfully escape from the disc at Alfven velocity and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$ sBH (including its binding gas) in the inner regions of the disc surrounding a supermassive black hole with $\sim 10^{7}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$, the reconnection process occurred in the space out of the disc can produce X-ray emission, which can last $\sim 10^4-10^6~\rm s$ with the luminosity $\sim 10^{39}- 10^{43}~\rm{erg ~s^{-1}}$.","['Jing-Tong Xing', 'Tong Liu', 'Bao-Quan Huang', 'Mouyuan Sun']",2.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10095,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['accretion', 'accretion discs - black hole physics - galaxies: nuclei - ma gnetic reconnection 1 INTRODUCTION Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit sig- niﬁcant ﬂux variations across multiple wavebands (e']",2025-01-20
Thermal Conduction and Thermal-Driven Winds in Magnetized Viscous Accretion Disk Dynamics,"This paper investigates the effects of saturated thermal conduction (TC) and thermal-driven winds (TDWs) on magnetized advection-dominated accretion onto a rotating black hole (BH). We incorporate dissipative processes in the magnetized accretion flow and expect the accretion disk to be threaded by predominantly toroidal and turbulent magnetic fields. We solve the magnetohydrodynamics equations and construct a self-consistent steady model of the magnetized accretion flow surrounding a rotating BH, which includes TC and TDWs. We seek global accretion solutions spanning from the BH horizon to a large distance and analyze the solution's characteristics as a function of dissipation parameters. Accretion solutions with multiple critical points may exhibit shock waves if they meet the standing shock criteria. We found steady, global transonic, and shocked accretion solutions around the rotating BH. In particular, the wind parameter ($m$) and the saturated conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}$) significantly influence the dynamical behavior of shocks. The shock location moves away from the BH horizon as $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ increase, assuming fixed conditions at the disk's outer edge. Our formalism explains the declining phase of BH outbursts, characterized by a monotonic decrease in QPO frequency as the burst decays. Based on our findings, we conclude that the combined effect of $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters substantially alters the steady shock specific energy vs angular momentum parameter space and also modifies the corresponding post-shock luminosity vs QPO frequency parameter space. We propose, based on our theoretical model, that the $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters may significantly influence the evolution of the BH outbursts.","['Biplob Sarkar', 'Indu Kalpa Dihingia', 'Ranjeev Misra']",13.0,27.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10108,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['accretion'],2025-01-20
Discovery of Jet-Bubble-Disk Interaction: Jet Feedback on a Protoplanetary Disk via an Expanding Bubble in WSB 52,"While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$~erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.","['Masataka Aizawa', 'Ryuta Orihara', 'Munetake Momose']",6.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10121,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['Protoplanetary disks (1300)'],2025-01-20
The promise of deep-stacking for neutrino astronomy,"The detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube has opened new windows for neutrino astronomy, but their sources remains largely unresolved. We study a methodology to address this - deep-stacking - that exploits correlations between observed neutrinos and comprehensive catalogs of potential source populations, including faint, high-redshift sources. By stacking signals from numerous weak sources and optimizing source weighting, significant gains in sensitivity can be achieved, particularly in the low-background regime where individual high-energy neutrinos dominate. We provide a semi-analytic framework to estimate sensitivity improvements for populations of sources under various background scenarios and redshift evolutions. Our analysis demonstrates that deep-stacking can increase detection sensitivity by a factor of 3 to 5, enabling detailed population studies. Furthermore, we discuss the potential to resolve the diffuse neutrino flux and investigate the redshift evolution of source populations. This approach offers a direct path toward identifying the primary sites of cosmic-ray acceleration and the mechanisms responsible for high-energy neutrino production.","['Marek Kowalski', 'Markus Ackermann', 'Imre Bartos']",5.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10213,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-20
DeepSSM: an emulator of gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions,"We present DeepSSM, an open-source code powered by neural networks (NNs) to emulate gravitational wave (GW) spectra produced by sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions in the radiation-dominated era. The training data is obtained from an enhanced version of the Sound Shell Model (SSM), which accounts for the effects of cosmic expansion and yields more accurate spectra in the infrared regime. The emulator enables instantaneous predictions of GW spectra given the phase transition parameters, while achieving agreement with the enhanced SSM model within 10\% accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. The emulator is highly computationally efficient and fully differentiable, making it particularly suitable for direct Bayesian inference on phase transition parameters without relying on empirical templates, such as broken power-law models. We demonstrate this capability by successfully reconstructing phase transition parameters and their degeneracies from mock LISA observations using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler.

High flow speeds and transition-region like temperatures in the solar chromosphere during flux emergence,"Context: Flux emergence in the solar atmosphere is a complex process that causes a release of magnetic energy as heat and acceleration of solar plasma at a variety of spatial scales. Methods: We analysed imaging spectropolarimetric data taken in the He 1083 nm line. This line is sensitive to temperatures larger than 15 kK, unlike diagnostics such as \MgIIhk, \CaIIHK, and \Halpha, which lose sensitivity already at 15 kK. The He I data is complemented by imaging spectropolarimetry in the \CaIIK, \Feline, and \Caline\ lines. We employed inversions to determine the magnetic field and vertical velocity in the solar atmosphere. We computed He 1083 nm profiles from a radiation-MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere to help interpretation of the observations. Results: We find fast-evolving blob-like emission features in the He 1083 nm triplet at locations where the magnetic field is rapidly changing direction, and these are likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We fit the line with a model consisting of an emitting layer located below a cold layer representing the fibril canopy. The modelling provides evidence that this model, while simple, catches the essential characteristics of the line formation. The morphology of the emission in the He 1083 nm line is localized and blob-like, unlike the emission in the \CaIIK\ line, which is more filamentary. Conclusions: The modelling shows that the \Heline\ emission features and their Doppler shifts can be caused by opposite-polarity reconnection and/or horizontal current sheets below the canopy layer in the chromosphere. Based on the high observed Doppler width and the blob-like appearance of the emission features, we conjecture that at least a fraction of them are produced by plasmoids. We conclude that transition-region-like temperatures in the deeper layers of the active region chromosphere are more common than previously thought.","['J.

Evidence for the gravity-driven and magnetically-regularized gas flows feeding the massive protostellar cluster in Cep A,"The hierarchical interplay among gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulent gas flows in delivering the necessary material to form massive protostellar clusters remains enigmatic. We have performed high-resolution (beam size $\sim$14 arcsec $\simeq$ 0.05 pc at a distance 725 pc) 850 $\mu$m dust polarization and C$^{18}$O molecular line observations of Cepheus A (Cep A), the second closest massive star-forming region, using the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) along with the SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. Our key analyses reveal that (i) morphologically, all three fields--gravitational (G), magnetic (B), and kinetic (K) fields--are aligned with each other, and (ii) energetically, they exhibit a hierarchical relationship with gravitational ($E_{\mathrm{G}}$) > magnetic ($E_{\mathrm{B}}$) > kinetic ($E_{\mathrm{K}}$). Gravity dominates in Cep A clump and, as a primary active player, dictates the other two agents. Consequently, gravity plays two active roles: (i) induces gas flows and (ii) drags B-field lines toward the gravitational trough. Since magnetic energy dominates kinetic energy, $E_{\mathrm{B}}$ > $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the ""dragged-in"" B-field as a secondary active player can mitigate turbulence and instabilities, thereby regularizing gas flows into a more ordered configuration. At the $\sim$0.60 pc clump scale, these flows deliver material at a substantially high rate of $\sim$ 2.1$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ toward the cluster center. Our study, for the first time, presents new insights into how B-fields and turbulent gas flows passively assist the active role of gravity in the formation of a protostellar cluster, contrasting with the standard notion that these agents primarily oppose gravitational collapse.","['Panigrahy Sandhyarani', 'Chakali Eswaraiah', 'Enrique Vázquez-Semadeni', 'Gilberto C.

No evidence that the binary black hole mass distribution evolves with redshift,"The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted to evolve with redshift, reflecting systematic changes in their astrophysical environment, stellar progenitors, and/or dominant formation channels over cosmic time. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave data, however, remains an open question, with some contradictory results present in the literature. In this paper, we study the ensemble of binary black holes within the latest GWTC-3 catalog released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, systematically surveying for possible evolution of their mass distribution with redshift. We specifically focus on two key features present in the binary black hole primary mass distribution -- (1) an excess of $35\,M_\odot$ black holes and (2) a broad power-law continuum ranging from 10 to $\gtrsim 80 M_\odot$ -- and ask if one or both of these features are observed to vary with redshift. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian peak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with redshift. In some cases, we place somewhat stringent bounds on the degree of allowed redshift evolution. Most notably, we find that the mean location of the $35\,M_\odot$ peak and the slope of the power-law continuum are constrained to remain approximately constant below redshift $z\approx 1$. The data remain more agnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the height of the $35\,M_\odot$ excess or the minimum and maximum black hole masses. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum remains possible, but that it is not required by current data.","['Max Lalleman', 'Kevin Turbang', 'Thomas Callister', 'Nick van Remortel']",14.0,21.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10295,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-20
Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for Resolving Cosmological Tensions,"The $\Lambda$CDM model has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations, but is increasingly challenged by the emergence of cosmological tensions, particularly the Hubble Tension $H_0$ and the $S_8$ tension. The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\sigma$, and the $S_8$ tension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\sigma$, highlight inconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or vice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark species are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3 samples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis shows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data. However, we show that the IDE model features positive Bayesian evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM only when Cepheid distance calibration in the SH0ES sample is used to calibrate SNIa data from PantheonPlus.","['Miguel A.

I Zw 1 and H0557-385: The Dusty Tori of Two High Eddington AGNs Observed in the MATISSE LM-Bands,"The torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a complex dynamical structure of gas and dust. It is thought to be composed of an equatorial dusty disk and a polar dusty wind launched by radiation pressure. However, this picture is based on studies of moderately accreting AGN. Models suggest that the disk/wind structure will change with specific accretion rate. Here we examine the wind launching region in two high accretion rate objects, I Zw 1 (super-Eddington) and H0557-385 (high-Eddington), using high spatial resolution interferometric observations in the $K$-band from VLTI/GRAVITY and $LM$-bands VLTI/MATISSE. We recover wavelength-dependent sizes of the dust emission using a Gaussian and power law fit to the visibilities. Both objects are partially resolved and have radial sizes in the $KLM$-bands between 0.3 - 1.5 mas, with no signs of elongation. Combining our measurements with VLTI/MIDI $N$-band data gives a full multi-wavelength picture of the dust structure. We find that in H0557-385, the dust sizes between $3.5-8\:\mu\mathrm{m}$ are independent of the wavelength, roughly constant at $3-10$ sublimation radii. We argue that this indicates a direct view of the wind launching region and, together with an absence of polar elongation, this implies that any wind would be launched in a preferentially equatorial direction or blown out by strong radiation pressure. The size-wavelength relation for both objects shows a preferentially disky equatorial dust distribution. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the Eddington ratio shapes the inner dust structure, most notably the wind-launching region and wind direction.","['Farin Drewes', 'James H.

Enhancing the Reliability in Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Attention-Based Models,"We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.","['Hibiki Iwanaga', 'Mahoro Matsuyama', 'Yousuke Itoh']",14.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10486,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Machine Learning', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,[],2025-01-22
Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. III. Search for companions to members of young associations,"Absolute astrometry with Gaia is expected to detect and characterize the orbits of thousands of exoplanets in the coming years. A tool, GaiaPMEX, was recently developed to characterize multiple systems based on Gaia-only data, and, when possible, the Gaia-Hipparcos proper motion anomaly. We compare the detection capabilities of absolute astrometry and spectroscopy (RV), and to detect and characterize planetary-mass companions, combining the astrometric data with direct imaging and RV data. For companion masses possibly in the planetary range, we use direct imaging and when possible, RV data as well, to further constrain their nature and orbital properties.For each target, a diagnosis on its binarity based on absolute astrometry is given. When no binary is detected, we provides detection limits in the (sma, mass) space. We identify several companions with possible masses down to the brown dwarfs (BD; 50+) or planetary masses (13). We detect a new giant planet at less than 1-2 au from the M-type star G80-21. For AB Pic and HD 14082 B, we confirm the presence of substellar companions, and provide robust solutions for their mass and orbital properties. We further identify 9 planetary mass companions candidates. Finally, a detailed treatment of noises in Gaia astrometric measurements shows that there are no evidence at a 2-sigma level of two exoplanet detections previously announced.Combining GaiaPMEX and RV data is therefore perfectly adaptIn the 0.5 to 5 au domain, GaiaPMEX has an excellent sensitivity to BDs, and a good sensitivity to planetary mass planets for this sample.","['A.-M.

A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS,"The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500Å) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.","['Lauren Halstead Willett', 'Joe P.

Connection between steep radio spectral slopes and dust extinction in QSOs: evidence for outflow-driven shocks in dusty QSO,"Recent studies have found a striking positive correlation between the amount of dust obscuration and enhanced radio emission in quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). However, what causes this connection remains unclear. In this paper we analyse uGMRT Band-3 (400 MHz) and Band-4 (650 MHz) data of a sample of 38 $1.0 < z < 1.5$ QSOs with existing high-resolution $0.2''$ e-MERLIN 1.4 GHz imaging. In combination with archival radio data, we have constructed sensitive 4-5 band radio SEDs across 0.144-3 GHz to further characterize the radio emission in dusty QSOs. We find that the dusty QSOs (those with E(B-V) $> 0.1$ mag) are more likely to exhibit steep spectral slopes ($\alpha < -0.5$; $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) than the non-dusty QSOs (E(B-V) $< 0.1$ mag), with fractions of 46$\pm$12 and 12$\pm$4 per cent, respectively. A higher fraction of the non-dusty QSOs have peaked radio SEDs (48$\pm$9 per cent) compared to the dusty QSOs (23$\pm$8 per cent). We discuss the origin of the radio emission, finding that the majority of the peaked, predominantly non-dusty, QSOs have consistent sizes and luminosities with compact jetted radio galaxies. However, the connection between steepness and dust obscuration implies an outflow-driven shock origin for the enhanced radio more commonly found in dusty QSOs. These results add to the emerging picture whereby dusty QSOs are in an earlier blow-out phase, with shocks that heat and destroy the surrounding dust, eventually revealing a typical non-dusty QSO.","['V.

MAGIS (Measuring Abundances of red super Giants with Infrared Spectroscopy) project I. Establishment of an abundance analysis procedure for red supergiants and its evaluation with nearby stars,"[Abbreviated] Context. Given their high luminosities (L>~10^4Lsun), red supergiants (RSGs) are good tracers of the chemical abundances of the young stellar population in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. However, previous abundance analyses tailored to RSGs suffer some systematic uncertainties originating in, most notably, the synthesized molecular spectral lines for RSGs. Aims. We establish a new abundance analysis procedure for RSGs that circumvents difficulties faced in previous works, and test the procedure with ten nearby RSGs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph WINERED (0.97--1.32 micron, R=28,000). Results. We determined the [X/Fe] of ten elements (Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Cr I, Ni I, and Y II). We estimated the relative precision in the derived abundances to be 0.04--0.12 dex for elements with more than two lines analyzed (e.g., Fe I and Mg I) and up to 0.18 dex for the other elements (e.g., Y II). We compared the resultant abundances of RSGs with the well-established abundances of another type of young star, namely the Cepheids, in order to evaluate the potential systematic bias in our abundance measurements, assuming that the young stars (i.e., both RSGs and Cepheids) in the solar neighborhood have common chemical abundances. We find that the determined RSG abundances are highly consistent with those of Cepheids within <~0.1 dex for some elements (notably [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]), which means the bias in the abundance determination for these elements is likely to be small. In contrast, the consistency is worse for some other elements (e.g., [Si/Fe] and [Y/Fe]). Nevertheless, the dispersion of the chemical abundances among our target RSGs is comparable with the individual statistical errors on the abundances. Hence, the procedure is likely to be useful to evaluate the relative difference in chemical abundances among RSGs.","['Daisuke Taniguchi', 'Noriyuki Matsunaga', 'Naoto Kobayashi', 'Mingjie Jian', 'Brian Thorsbro', 'Kei Fukue', 'Satoshi Hamano', 'Yuji Ikeda', 'Hideyo Kawakita', 'Sohei Kondo', 'Shogo Otsubo', 'Hiroaki Sameshima', 'Takuji Tsujimoto', 'Chikako Yasui']",1.0,29.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10502,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,"A&A, 693, A163 (2025)",['stars: abundances – stars: massive – stars: late-type – infrared: stars – Galaxy: abundances – methods: data analysis 1'],2025-01-22
High-Significance Detection of Correlation Between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and the Large Scale Cosmic Structure,"Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has improved dramatically in the past decade, however, the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) still has a potential wealth of information about the faintest $\gamma$-ray sources pervading the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations with tracers of cosmic structure can indirectly identify the populations that most characterize the $\gamma$-ray background. In this study, we analyze the angular correlation between the $\gamma$-ray background and the matter distribution in the Universe as traced by gravitational lensing, leveraging more than a decade of observations from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) and 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We detect a correlation at signal-to-noise ratio of 8.9. Most of the statistical significance comes from large scales, demonstrating, for the first time, that a substantial portion of the UGRB aligns with the mass clustering of the Universe as traced by weak lensing. Blazars provide a plausible explanation for this signal, especially if those contributing to the correlation reside in halos of large mass ($\sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) and account for approximately 30-40 % of the UGRB above 10 GeV. Additionally, we observe a preference for a curved $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum, with a log-parabolic shape being favored over a power-law. We also discuss the possibility of modifications to the blazar model and the inclusion of additional $gamma$-ray sources, such as star-forming galaxies or particle dark matter.","['B. Thakore', 'M.

Gamma-ray burst prompt emission spectra at high energies,"Despite more than fifty years of gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations, several questions regarding the origin of the prompt emission, particularly at high energies, remain unresolved. We present a comprehensive analysis of 35 GRBs observed by \textit{Fermi}/GBM and \textit{Fermi}/LAT over the past 15 years, focusing on the nature of high-energy (HE, E$>$100 MeV) emission during the prompt emission phase. Our study combines temporal and spectral analyses to investigate the synchrotron origin of the observed emission spanning the energy range from 10 keV to 100 GeV and explore the possible contribution of additional spectral components. Temporal modeling of \textit{Fermi}/LAT light curves for 12 GRBs in our sample reveals deviations from standard afterglow scenarios during the early phases, suggesting a significant contamination from prompt emission. We find that most GRB spectra align with synchrotron emission extending to GeV energies, with the slope $p$ of the non-thermal electron distribution clustering around $p\sim2.7$, consistently with theoretical predictions. For three GRBs, an additional power law component is required to explain the high-energy emission, but the nature and temporal evolution of this component remain unclear due to the limited quality of \textit{Fermi}/LAT data. When the power law component is needed, the synchrotron spectrum shows a sharp MeV suppression. It could be explained by the pair loading effects in the early afterglow. These findings emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength observations in unveiling the mechanisms driving early HE prompt emission in GRBs. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for future very-high-energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, and address the detection prospects of additional non-thermal components in GRB spectra.","['Samanta Macera', 'Biswajit Banerjee', 'Alessio Mei', 'Pawan Tiwari', 'Gor Oganesyan', 'Marica Branchesi']",9.0,30.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10507,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-ray bursts – astroparticle physics – high energy astrophysics 1'],2025-01-22
REBELS-IFU: Dust Build-up in Massive Galaxies at Redshift 7,"In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond $z\gtrsim6$. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve $6.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7$ galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average $\log(\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \pm 0.23$, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average $\log(\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \pm 0.42$ is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at $z\approx7$ likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.","['Hiddo Algera', 'Lucie Rowland', 'Mauro Stefanon', 'Marco Palla', 'Laura Sommovigo', 'Hanae Inami', 'Rychard Bouwens', 'Manuel Aravena', 'Rebecca Bowler', 'Pratika Dayal', 'Ilse De Looze', 'Andrea Ferrara', 'Rebecca Fisher', 'Luca Graziani', 'Cindy Gulis', 'Kasper Heintz', 'Jacqueline Hodge', 'Ivana van Leeuwen', 'Andrea Pallottini', 'Siân Phillips', 'Sander Schouws', 'Renske Smit', 'Daniel Stark', 'Paul van der Werf']",5.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10508,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: evolution – galaxies: high-redshift – submillimeter: galaxies ★E-mail: hsbalgera@asiaa'],2025-01-22
Stellar Stripping and Disruption in Disks around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Repeating nuclear transients prior to LISA events,"If supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are driven together by gas disks in galactic nuclei, then a surrounding nuclear star cluster or in-situ star-formation should deliver stars to the disk plane. Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary disk tidal disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Wether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.","[""Daniel J.

The rapid formation of macromolecules in irradiated ice of protoplanetary disk dust traps,"Organic macromolecular matter is the dominant carrier of volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and noble gases in chondrites -- the rocky building blocks from which Earth formed. How this macromolecular substance formed in space is unclear. We show that its formation could be associated with the presence of dust traps, which are prominent mechanisms for forming planetesimals in planet-forming disks. We demonstrate the existence of heavily irradiated zones in dust traps, where small frozen molecules that coat large quantities of microscopic dust grains could be rapidly converted into macromolecular matter by receiving radiation doses of up to several 10s of eV molecule$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$. This allows for the transformation of simple molecules into complex macromolecular matter within several decades. Up to roughly 4$\%$ of the total disk ice reservoir can be processed this way and subsequently incorporated into the protoplanetary disk midplane where planetesimals form. This finding shows that planetesimal formation and the production of organic macromolecular matter, which provides the essential elemental building blocks for life, might be linked.","['Niels F. W.

A highly magnetized long-period radio transient exhibiting unusual emission features,"Long-period radio transients are a new class of astrophysical objects that exhibit periodic radio emission on timescales of tens of minutes. Their true nature remains unknown; possibilities include magnetic white dwarfs, binary systems, or long-period magnetars; the latter class is predicted to produce fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, we conducted follow-up observations of the long-period radio transient GPM J1839-10. Here we report that the source exhibits a wide range of unusual emission properties, including polarization characteristics indicative of magnetospheric origin, linear-to-circular polarization conversion, and drifting substructures closely resembling those observed in repeating FRBs. These radio characteristics provide evidence in support of the long-period magnetar model and suggest a possible connection between long-period radio transients, magnetars, and FRBs.","['Yunpeng Men', 'Sam McSweeney', 'Natasha Hurley-Walker', 'Ewan Barr', 'Ben Stappers']",4.0,55.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10528,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-22
PAH Feature Ratios Around Stellar Clusters and Associations in 19 Nearby Galaxies,"We present a comparison of observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature ratios in 19 nearby galaxies with a grid of theoretical expectations for near- and mid-infrared dust emission. The PAH feature ratios are drawn from Cycle 1 JWST observations and are measured for 7224 stellar clusters and 29176 stellar associations for which we have robust ages and mass estimates from HST five-band photometry. Though there are galaxy-to-galaxy variations, the observed PAH feature ratios largely agree with the theoretical models, particularly those that are skewed toward more ionized and larger PAH size distributions. For each galaxy we also extract PAH feature ratios for 200 pc-wide circular regions in the diffuse interstellar medium, which serve as a non-cluster/association control sample. Compared to what we find for stellar clusters and associations, the 3.3um/7.7um and 3.3um/11.3um ratios from the diffuse interstellar medium are $\sim 0.10-0.15$ dex smaller. When the observed PAH feature ratios are compared to the radiation field hardness as probed by the [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, we find anti-correlations for nearly all galaxies in the sample. These results together suggest that the PAH feature ratios are driven by the shape intensity of the radiation field, and that the smallest PAHs -- observed via JWST F335M imaging -- are increasingly 'processed' or destroyed in regions with the most intense and hard radiation fields.","['Daniel A.

REBELS-IFU: Dust attenuation curves of 12 massive galaxies at $z\simeq7$,"We present measurements of the dust attenuation curves of 12 massive ($9~<~\log$($M_{\star}/{M}_{\odot})$ $<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$ derived from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. The galaxies are drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) large program. The dust attenuation curves were obtained by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models with a flexible dust law to the full galaxy spectra over observed wavelengths $0.6-5.3$ $\mu$m. These attenuation curves show a range of recovered slopes ($-0.39\leq\delta\leq0.08$) that are on average slightly flatter than seen in local sources of the same stellar masses, with none exhibiting very steep slopes. Three galaxies exhibit evidence for a 2175 Å dust bump ($>4\sigma$) and we find SED fitting excluding the bump can overestimate derived stellar masses by up to $0.4$ dex. Correcting for the dust attenuation with our best-fit attenuation curves we recover a range of intrinsic UV-slopes ($-2.5\leq\beta_0\leq-2.2$). The galaxies show moderate reddening ($A_V~=~0.1-0.6$ mag) and the $A_V$ to stellar mass relation is consistent with local sources. The attenuation law slope is found to correlate with $A_V$, while we see no strong correlation with stellar mass, ${M_{\rm UV}}$, or gas-phase metallicity. Overall, our results show little evolution in dust properties in the REBELS sources compared to the local Universe. Comparing our recovered trends to empirical models suggests that the most important factor driving the variation in the attenuation curves in our sample is the dust-star geometry, not the properties of the dust grains themselves.","['Rebecca Fisher', 'Rebecca A.

REBELS-IFU: Evidence for metal-rich massive galaxies at z~6-8,"Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive ($\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})>9$) galaxies at $z\sim 6$-$8$ from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]$\lambda$3727,9 to [SII]$\lambda$6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average $\sim3.7$) and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (average ${EW_{[OIII]}}\sim390$Å) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at $z>6$, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at $z>6$ (average $Z_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim 0.4 Z_{\odot}$), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average $\log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}\sim9.5$). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at $6<z<8$. In contrast to recent studies of lower-mass galaxies, we find no evidence for negative offsets to the $z=0$ FMR for the REBELS galaxies. This work demonstrates the existence of chemically-enriched galaxies just $\sim1$ Gyr after the Big Bang, and indicates that the MZR is already in place at these early times, in agreement with other recent $z>3$ studies.","['Lucie E.

WALLABY Pilot Survey: kNN identification of perturbed galaxies through HI morphometrics,"Galaxy morphology in stellar light can be described by a series of ""non-parametric"" or ""morphometric"" parameters, such as concentration-asymmetry-smoothness, Gini, $M_{20}$, and Sersic fit. These parameters can be applied to column density maps of atomic hydrogen (HI). The HI distribution is susceptible to perturbations by environmental effects, e.g. inter-galactic medium pressure and tidal interactions. Therefore, HI morphology can potentially identify galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions. We explore three fields in the WALLABY Pilot HI survey and identify perturbed galaxies based on a k-nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm using an HI morphometric feature space. For training, we used labeled galaxies in the combined NGC 4808 and NGC 4636 fields with six HI morphometrics to train and test a kNN classifier. The kNN classification is proficient in classifying perturbed galaxies with all metrics -- accuracy, precision and recall -- at 70-80%. By using the kNN method to identify perturbed galaxies in the deployment field, the NGC 5044 mosaic, we find that in most regards, the scaling relations of perturbed and unperturbed galaxies have similar distribution in the scaling relations of stellar mass vs star formation rate and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but the HI and stellar mass relation flatter than of the unperturbed galaxies. Our results for NGC 5044 provide a prediction for future studies on the fraction of galaxies undergoing interaction in this catalogue and to build a training sample to classify such galaxies in the full WALLABY survey.","['B.W.

Near-circular orbits for planets around M/K-type stars with Earth-like sizes and instellations,"Recent advances have enabled the discovery of a population of potentially Earth-like planets, yet their orbital eccentricity, which governs their climate and provides clues about their origin and dynamical history, is still largely unconstrained. We identify a sample of 17 transiting exoplanets around late-type stars with similar radii and irradiation to that of Earth and use the ""photoeccentric effect"" - which exploits transit durations - to infer their eccentricity distribution via hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Our analysis establishes that these worlds further resemble Earth in that their eccentricities are nearly circular (mean eccentricity $=0.060_{-0.028}^{+0.040}$ and $\leq0.15$), with the exception of one outlier of moderate eccentricity. The results hint at a subset population of dynamically warmer Earths, but this requires a larger sample to statistically confirm. The planets in our sample are thus largely subject to minimal eccentricity-induced seasonal variability and are consistent with emerging via smooth disk migration rather than violent planet-planet scattering.","['David Kipping', 'Diana Solano-Oropeza', 'Daniel A.

A Large Systematic Search for Close Supermassive Binary and Rapidly Recoiling Black Holes -- IV. Ultraviolet spectroscopy,"We present Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet (UV) of 13 quasars at z<0.7, along with contemporaneous optical spectra from ground-based telescopes. The targets were selected to have broad H-beta emission lines with substantial velocity offsets relative to the rest frame of their host galaxy. By analogy to single-line spectroscopic binary stars, these objects have been regarded as supermassive black hole binary (SBHB) candidates where the offset emission lines may be caused by bulk orbital motion. The best alternative explanation is that the H-beta line profile is the result of non-axisymmetric emission from a disk-like broad-line region associated with a single supermassive black hole. We use the broad UV line profiles to discriminate between these two scenarios. We describe our methodology for isolating the broad optical and UV line profiles and the criteria we apply for comparing them. Of the 13 SBHB candidates, three have strong evidence in support of the SBHB hypothesis, five have tentative support, one is disfavored, and four have such severely absorbed UV line profiles that the results are inconclusive.","['Jessie C.

Selecting samples of galaxies with fewer Fingers-of-God,"The radial positions of galaxies inferred from their measured redshift appear distorted due to their peculiar velocities. We argue that the contribution from stochastic velocities -- which gives rise to `Fingers-of-God' (FoG) anisotropy in the inferred maps -- does not lend itself to perturbative modelling already on scales targeted by current experiments. To get around this limitation, we propose to remove FoG using data-driven indicators of their abundance that are local in nature and thus avoid selection biases. In particular, we show that the scale where the measured power spectrum quadrupole changes sign is tightly anti-correlated with both the satellite fraction and the velocity dispersion, and can thus be used to select galaxy samples with fewer FoG. In addition, we show that maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich distortion of the cosmic microwave background frequency spectrum can be used to identify and discard many of the most problematic galaxies. These techniques could potentially extend the reach of perturbative models for galaxy clustering and improve reconstructions of the large-scale velocity and displacement fields from the redshift-space positions of galaxies.","['Antón Baleato Lizancos', 'Uroš Seljak', 'Minas Karamanis', 'Marco Bonici', 'Simone Ferraro']",19.0,33.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10587,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-22
Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching,"Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions.

The excess emission of the H$_\alpha$ line in the LAMOST spectra of this object was analyzed, indicating its chromospheric activity. The $O-C$ diagram showed a long-term orbital period increase, which is due to the mass transfer between the two component stars.

CWTHF: Identifying Dark Matter Halos with Continuous Wavelet Transform,"Cosmological simulations are an important method for investigating the evolution of the Universe. In order to gain further insight into the processes of structure formation, it is necessary to identify isolated bound objects within the simulations, namely, the dark matter halos. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is an effective tool used as a halo finder due to its ability to extract clustering information from the input data. In this study, we introduce CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder), the first wavelet-based, MPI-parallelized halo finder, marking a novel approach in the field of cosmology. We calculate the CWT from the cloud-in-cell (CIC) grid and segment the grid based on the local CWT maxima. We then investigate the effects of the parameters that influence our program and identify the default settings. A comparison with the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) method demonstrates the viability of CWT for halo finding. Although the actual performance is not faster than FOF, the linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ of our identification scheme indicates its significant potential for future optimization and application.","['Minxing Li', 'Yun Wang', 'Ping He']",15.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10622,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-22
A pioneering experiment combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data to measure Faraday rotation with GMIMS and the CGPS,"Structures in the magneto-ionic medium exist across a wide range of angular sizes due to large-scale magnetic fields coherent over the Galactic spiral arms combined with small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density resulting from energy injection processes such as supernovae. For the first time, we produce diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission Faraday rotation maps covering all spatial scales down to $3'$ resolution for Galactic magnetic field studies. These maps complement standard total and polarized intensity maps combining single-antenna and interferometric data that have been produced, for example, for the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). Such combined maps have sensitivity to large scales from the single-antenna component, and the resolution from the interferometric component. We combine Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey High-Band-North (GMIMS-HBN) single-antenna and CGPS aperture-synthesis polarization data after spatial filtering, producing Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps individually for the four CGPS frequency channels. We calculate Rotation Measures (RM) for all pixels using a linear fit to polarization angle versus wavelength squared. The RM maps show magnetic field structures on the full range of scales probed by this dataset. Regions of smooth polarized emission require the large-scale sensitivity of the single-antenna data to illuminate the Faraday depths, while the aperture-synthesis data reveal small-scale variability in the Faraday rotation. Despite the limitation of the 35 MHz bandwidth of the CGPS, we demonstrate that useful information on Faraday rotation structures can be obtained by combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data, highlighting the important synergy between future broadband interferometric and single-antenna polarization surveys.","['Anna Ordog', 'Jo-Anne C.

Evidence for Jet/Outflow Shocks Heating the Environment Around the Class I Protostellar Source Elias 29: FAUST XXI,"We have observed the late Class I protostellar source Elias~29 at a spatial-resolution of 70~au with the Atacama~Large~Millimeter/submillimeter~Array (ALMA) as part of the FAUST Large Program. We focus on the line emission of SO, while that of $^{34}$SO, C$^{18}$O, CS, SiO, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, and DCO$^{+}$ are used supplementally. The spatial distribution of the SO rotational temperature ($T_{\rm rot}$(SO)) is evaluated by using the intensity ratio of its two rotational excitation lines. Besides in the vicinity of the protostar, two hot spots are found at a distance of 500 au from the protostar; $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) locally rises to 53$^{+25}_{-15}$~K at the interaction point of the outflow and the southern ridge, and 72$^{+66}_{-29}$~K within the southeastern outflow probably due to a jet-driven bow shock. However, the SiO emission is not detected at these hot spots. It is likely that active gas accretion through the disk-like structure and onto the protostar still continues even at this evolved protostellar stage, at least sporadically, considering the outflow/jet activities and the possible infall motion previously reported. Interestingly, $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) is as high as 20$-$30~K even within the quiescent part of the southern ridge apart from the protostar by 500$-$1000~au without clear kinematic indication of current outflow/jet interactions. Such a warm condition is also supported by the low deuterium fractionation ratio of HCO$^+$ estimated by using the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and DCO$^{+}$ lines. The B-type star HD147889 $\sim$0.5 pc away from Elias~29, previously suggested as a heating source for this region, is likely responsible for the warm condition of Elias~29.","['Yoko Oya', 'Eri Saiga', 'Anna Miotello', 'FAUST members']",8.0,47.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10634,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['ISM: individual (Elias 29', 'star-formation', 'WL15)', 'low-mass', 'Jet/outflow', 'protostar']",2025-01-22
Preliminary results from 5 years' spectral monitoring of Antares,"We present preliminary results of 5 years' monitoring of the radial velocity of Alpha Sco, performed at the Astronomical Observatory of the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. The data include 580 spectra acquired on 153 nights between March 2015 and March 2020. The aim of this study is to probe the dynamics of the star's atmosphere on all possible time-scales through the variations in observed radial velocity. At present, our findings are consistent with previous results from other observers, and the combination of older and new data make it possible to assess the several periodicities. A detailed study of these results, including the convective motions in the photosphere, is still in progress.","['Benjamin Oostra', 'Maria Gracia Batista']",4.0,5.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10646,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Spectroscopy — Red Supergiant — Radial Velocity — Stellar At mospheres 1'],2025-01-22
GPU Accelerated Image Quality Assessment-Based Software for Transient Detection,"Fast imaging localises celestial transients using source finders in the image domain. The need for high computational throughput in this process is driven by next-generation telescopes such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which, upon completion, will be the world's largest aperture synthesis radio telescope. It will collect data at unprecedented velocity and volume. Due to the vast amounts of data the SKA will produce, current source finders based on source extraction may be inefficient in a wide-field search. In this paper, we focus on the software development of GPU-accelerated transient finders based on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods -- Low-Information Similarity Index (LISI) and augmented LISI (augLISI). We accelerate the algorithms using GPUs, achieving kernel time of approximately 0.1 milliseconds for transient finding in 2048X2048 images.","['X. Li', 'K. Adamek', 'W.

An Unexplained Origin for the Unusual Globular Cluster System in the Ultra-diffuse Galaxy FCC 224,"We study the quiescent ultra-diffuse galaxy FCC 224 in the Fornax cluster using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, motivated by peculiar properties of its globular cluster (GC) system revealed in shallower imaging. The surface brightness fluctuation distance of FCC 224 measured from HST is $18.6 \pm 2.7$ Mpc, consistent with the Fornax Cluster distance. We use Prospector to infer the stellar population from a combination of multi-wavelength photometry (HST, ground-based, WISE) and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy. The galaxy has a mass-weighted age of $\sim$ 10 Gyr, metallicity [M/H] of $\sim -1.25$ dex, and a very short formation $e$-folding time of $\tau \sim 0.3$ Gyr. Its 12 candidate GCs exhibit highly homogeneous $g_{\rm 475}-I_{\rm 814}$ colors, merely 0.04 mag bluer than the diffuse starlight, which supports a single burst formation scenario for this galaxy. We confirm a top-heavy GC luminosity function, similar to the two dark matter deficient galaxies NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4. However, FCC 224 differs from those galaxies with relatively small GC sizes of $\sim$ 3 pc ($\sim 35\%$ smaller than typical for other dwarfs), and with radial mass segregation in its GC system. We are not yet able to identify a formation scenario to explain all of the GC properties in FCC 224. Follow-up measurements of the dark matter content in FCC 224 will be crucial because of the mix of similarities and differences among FCC 224, DF2, and DF4.","['Yimeng Tang', 'Aaron J.

The bolometric light curve modeling of 98 Type I superluminous supernovae using the magnetar- and the circumstellar interaction models reveals surprisingly high ejecta masses,"We present the bolometric light curve modeling of 98 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) using three types of power inputs: the magnetar model and two kinds of circumstellar interaction models, applying the constant density and the steady wind scenario. The quasi-bolometric luminosities of the objects were calculated from the ZTF g- and r-band data using the methodology of \citet{chen23b}, and then they were modeled with the Minim code. It was found that the light curves of 45 SLSNe-I can be fitted equally well with both the magnetar and the CSM models, 14 objects prefer the magnetar model and 39 SLSNe-I favor the CSM model. The magnetar modeling yielded a mean spin period of $P~=~4.1 \pm 0.20$ ms and a magnetic field of $B~=~5.65 \pm 0.43 \cdot 10^{14}$ G, consistently with the literature. However, the ejected mass was estimated to be significantly larger compared to previous studies presenting either multi-color light curve modeling with MOSFiT or bolometric light curve modeling: we obtained a mean value and standard error of 34.26 and 4.67 $M_\odot$, respectively. The circumstellar interaction models resulted in even larger ejecta masses with a mean and standard error of 116.82 and 5.97 $M_\odot$ for the constant density model, and 105.99 and 4.50 $M_\odot$ for the steady wind model. Although the ejected mass depends strongly on the electron scattering opacity (assumed to be $\kappa~=~$0.2 in this work) and the ejecta velocity, which were estimated to be globally larger compared to earlier studies, our results suggest that SLSNe-I are indeed the explosions of the most massive stars.",['Réka Könyves-Tóth'],29.0,23.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10671,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['supenovae: general – 1'],2025-01-22
Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disk I: Gas-Enhanced Binary Orbital Hardening,"Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei may contribute to gravitational wave\,(GW) events detected by grounded-based GW detectors. In particular, the interaction between a BBH and a single stellar-mass black hole\,(sBH), known as the binary-single interaction\,(BSI) process, can potentially lead to GW events with detectable non-zero eccentricity. Previous studies of the BSI process, which neglected the effects of gas, showed that BSIs contribute non-negligibly to GW events in a coplanar disk environment. In this work, we conduct a series of 2-dimensional hydrodynamical and N-body simulations to explore the BSI in a gas environment by coupling REBOUND with Athena++. We perform 360 simulation runs, spanning parameters in disk surface density \(\Sigma_0\) and impact parameter \(b\). We find that the gas-induced energy dissipation within the three-body system becomes significant if the encounter velocity between the sBHs is sufficiently large\,($\gg c_s$). Our simulation results indicate that approximately half of the end states of the BSI are changed by gas. Furthermore, at higher gas density, the number of encounters during the BSI process will increase and the end-state BBHs tend to be more compact. Consequently, the presence of gas may shorten the GW merger timescale for end-state BBHs and increase the three-body merger rate.","['Mengye Wang', 'Yiqiu Ma', 'Hui Li', 'Qingwen Wu', 'Ya-Ping Li', 'Xiangli Lei', 'Jiancheng Wu']",12.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10703,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,The Astrophysical Journal,,['black hole physics– accretion disk – GW – BBH 1'],2025-01-22

Diurnal and Seasonal variations of Gravity Waves in the lower atmosphere of Mars as observed by Insight,"We investigate Gravity Waves (GWs) in the lower atmosphere of Mars based on pressure timeseries acquired by the InSight lander. We compile a climatology showing that most GW activity detected at the InSight landing site takes place after the sunrise and sunset, they are almost absent during the aphelion season, and more prominent around the equinoxes, with variations during dust events and interannual variations. We find GWs with coherent phases in different sols, and a previously unnoticed coincidence of GW activity with those moments in which the diurnal cycle (of tidal origin) exhibits the fastest increases in absolute pressure. We explore the possibility that some of these GWs might actually be high-order harmonics of thermal tides transiently interfering constructively to produce relevant meteorological patterns, and discuss other interpretations based on wind patterns.

Studying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations using photometric redshifts from the DESI Legacy Imaging survey DR9,"Context. The DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, with its extensive dataset of galaxy locations and photometric redshifts, presents an opportunity to study Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the region covered by the ongoing DESI spectroscopic survey.Aims. We aim to investigate differences between different parts of the DR9 footprint. Furthermore, we want to measure the BAO scale for luminous red galaxies within them. Our selected redshift range of 0.6 to 0.8 corresponds to the bin in which a tension between DESI Y1 and eBOSS was found.Methods. We calculated the anisotropic two-point correlation function in a modified binning scheme to detect the BAO in DR9 data. We then use template fits based on simulations to measure the BAO scale in the imaging data.Results. Our analysis revealed the expected correlation function shape in most of the footprint areas, showing a BAO scale consistent with Planck's observations. Aside from identified mask-related data issues in the southern region of the South Galactic Cap, we also find a notable variance between the different footprints.Conclusions. We find that this variance is consistent with the difference between the DESI Y1 and eBOSS data and it supports the argument that that tension is caused by sample variance. Additionally, we also uncovered systematic biases not previously accounted for in photometric BAO studies. We emphasize the necessity of adjusting for the systematic shift in the BAO scale associated with typical photometric redshift uncertainties to ensure accurate measurements.","['Christoph Saulder', 'Yong-Seon Song', 'Minji Oh', 'Yi Zheng', 'Ashley J.

The outer gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section,"Toroidal structures are a common feature in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, including dusty tori in AGNs, rings in galaxies, protoplanetary disks, and others. The matter distribution in such structures is not homogeneous and can be flattened by self-gravity or become elongated in the vertical direction, as is the case with obscuring tori in AGNs. This led us to consider the more general case of the gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. We begin by showing that the outer potential of a homogeneous elliptical torus can be effectively approximated with less than 1\% error by the potentials of two infinitely thin rings with a minor correction term. These two rings have masses each equal to half the total mass of the torus. The most notable feature is that each such infinitely thin ring is positioned at precisely the halfway point between the center and the focus of the elliptical cross-section, regardless of the torus' other parameters. The result, which holds for both oblate and prolate geometries, allows us to find a new expression to handle the outer potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. The confocal density distribution is a special case. We have found that the outer potential of such a torus is only weakly dependent of the density distribution law. Consequently, even for the confocal inhomogeneous case, the outer potential is well represented by two infinitely thin rings. This approach can simplify problems of dynamics for the systems consisting of toroidal structures. We have also derived the expressions for the external force components exerted by a homogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section, both for the exact form of the potential and for our approximation by two infinitely thin rings. Comparison of the two shows that our model fits the true trend of the force well.","['Elena Bannikova', 'Serhii Skolota', 'Massimo Capaccioli']",15.0,28.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10771,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Classical Physics'],,,and others gravitation – methods: analytical – methods: numerical ,2025-01-22
Cosmological search for sterile neutrinos after DESI 2024,"The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.","['Guo-Hong Du', 'Tian-Nuo Li', 'Peng-Ju Wu', 'Lu Feng', 'Sheng-Han Zhou', 'Jing-Fei Zhang', 'Xin Zhang']",4.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10785,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-22
Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei: Implications for Cosmological Simulations of Galaxy Formation,"Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a very important role in constraining modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here, we utilize an advanced supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk model to compute the accretion flow structure and AGN SED across a wide range of black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) and dimensionless accretion rates $\dot{m}(\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm acc}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd})$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is the mass flow rate through the disk and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. We find that the radiative efficiency is mainly influenced by $\dot m$, while contributions of $M_{\rm SMBH}$ and $\dot{m}$ to the bolometric luminosity are comparably important. We have developed new scaling relationships that relate the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to its luminosities in the hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical bands. Our results align with existing literature at high luminosities but suggest lower luminosities in the hard and soft X-ray bands for AGNs with low bolometric luminosities than commonly reported values. Combining with the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation \textsc{L-Galaxies} and Millennium dark matter simulation for the distribution of ($M_{\rm SMBH}, \dot{m}$) at different redshift, we find the model predictions align well with observational data at redshifts below 1 but deviates for higher redshifts regarding AGN detection fraction and luminosity functions. This deviation may arise from improper treatment of SMBH growth at high redshifts in the model or bias from limited observational data. This AGN SED calculation can be readily applied in other cosmological simulations.","['Tong Su', 'Qi Guo', 'Erlin Qiao', 'Wenxiang Pei', 'Luis C. Ho', 'Cedric G.

A Non-Stop Aurora? The Intriguing Radio Emission from the Rapidly Rotating Magnetic Massive Star HR 5907,"HR 5907 (HD 142184) stands out among magnetic OB stars for its rapid rotation, exceptionally hard X-ray emission, and strong magnetic field. High-frequency (>5 GHz) radio emission from the star exhibits an approximately flat spectrum that can be attributed to gyrosynchrotron emission from a dense centrifugal magnetosphere. In a survey of radio emission from massive stars at sub-GHz frequencies, we noticed remarkable low-frequency radio emission from this star, characterized by high circular polarization and brightness temperature, which is inconsistent with the gyrosynchrotron model. We present a follow-up low-frequency radio study of this star with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in search of emission mechanisms that can go undiagnosed at higher frequencies. We detect variable radio emission characterized by varying degrees of circular polarization (15-45%) throughout the rotation cycle. The broad-band spectral fitting also suggests additional emission components at lower frequencies. We show that the observed emission is likely auroral emission via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), and identify this star as a Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitter (MRP). For MRPs, ECME is usually observed as short polarized enhancements near the magnetic nulls of the star. The detection of a high degree of circular polarization (>15%) at all times makes HR 5907 unique among MRPs. This is only the second MRP after $\rho$ Oph C (detected polarization fraction: 0-60%) that exhibits persistent coherent radio emission attributed to the nearly aligned stellar magnetic and rotational axes.","['Ayan Biswas', 'Barnali Das', 'James A.

Solar oblateness & asphericities temporal variations: outstanding some unsolved issues,"Solar oblateness has been the subject of several studies dating back to the nineteenth century. Despite diffculties, both theoretical and observational, tangible results have been achieved. However, variability of the solar oblateness with time is still poorly known. How the solar shape evolves with the solar cycle has been a challenging problem. Analysis of the helioseismic data, which are the most accurate measure of the solar structure up to now, leads to the determination of asphericity coeffcients which have been found to change with time. We show here that by inverting even coeffcients of f-mode oscillation frequency splitting to obtain the oblateness magnitude and its temporal dependence can be inferred. It is found that the oblateness variations lag the solar activity cycles by about 3 years. A major change occurred between solar cycles 23 and 24 is that the oblateness was greater in cycle 24 despite the lower solar activity level. Such results may help to better understand the near-subsurface layers as they strongly impacts the internal dynamics of the Sun and may induce instabilities driving the transport of angular momentum.","['Jean P.

Collisional study of Hilda and quasi-Hilda asteroids,"The Hilda asteroids are located in the outer main belt in a stable 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter, while the quasi-Hildas (qH) have similar orbits but are not directly under the effect of the MMR. Moreover, cometary activity has been detected in qH. In this study, we investigate the collisional evolution of Hilda asteroids and apply it to study the cratering on asteroid 334 Chicago, as well as to determine whether impacts between Hildas and qH can serve as a viable mechanism for inducing cometary activity. We simulated the collisional evolution of Hilda asteroids over a period of 4 Gyr. We considered three initial size-frequency distributions (SFD) and two scaling laws for the collisional outcomes and performed a large set of simulations for each scenario which we used to construct median SFDs of the Hilda population. We also derived impactor SFD on asteroid 334 Chicago and used it to calculate the crater SFD on 334 Chicago. Additionally, we evaluated the subcatastrophic impact timescale between Hilda and qH objects. The observed SFD of Hilda asteroids larger than 3 km is best matched by scenarios assuming that such SFD is mostly primordial, implying minimal collisional activity over time. For smaller sizes, although unconstrained, the SFD steepens significantly due to the catastrophic fragmentation of a small number of multikilometer-sized bodies. We determined that the largest impactor on 334 Chicago measures a few kilometers in size, resulting in a maximum crater size of approximately 30 km. Furthermore, the slope of the crater SFD mirrors that of the initial SFD for subkilometric bodies. While impact events between Hildas and qH can induce observable activity and although stochastic in nature, the timescale of such events exceeds the dynamical lifetime of qH, making them an unlikely primary mechanism for inducing observable activity.","['P.

Revisiting Christoph Scheiner's Sunspot Records: a New Perspective on Solar Activity of the Early Telescopic Era,"Christoph Scheiner was one of the most outstanding astronomers in the history of the sunspot observations. His book, Rosa Ursina, is the reference work regarding the study of the earliest sunspot records. The sunspot observations compiled by Scheiner in Rosa Ursina and Prodomus, including records made by other observers, forms one of the main references of the observations known for that period; particularly around the 1620s. Thus, his work is crucial to determine the solar activity level of the first solar cycles of the telescopic era. The number of sunspot groups recorded in Scheiner's documentary sources has been included in the existing sunspot group number databases. However, we have detected significant errors in the number of groups currently assigned to Scheiner's records. In this work, we reanalyze the information in Scheiner's source documents. Consequently, the standard 11-yr solar cycle shape for the second solar cycle of the telescopic era, which is not clear in previous studies, now becomes evident. In addition, the highest daily number of groups recorded during this cycle (8 groups) is 20% less than the one included in the existing sunspot group number databases. Using the hypergeometrical probability distribution, we find that solar minima in 2008-2009 and 2018-2019 are comparable to the most probable solar activity level of the minimum around 1632. In particular, the estimated lower limit for the solar activity in 1632 is even comparable with the solar activity level in 2008 and 2018.","['V.M.S. Carrasco', 'A. Muñoz-Jaramillo', 'M.C.

The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation II: Stellar Mass Models,"We present new color-$\Upsilon_*$ (mass-to-light) models to convert WISE W1 fluxes into stellar masses. We outline a range of possible star formation histories and chemical evolution scenarios to explore the confidence limits of stellar population models on the value of $\Upsilon_*$. We conclude that the greatest uncertainties (around 0.1 dex in $\Upsilon_*$) occur for the bluest galaxies with the strongest variation in recent star formation. For high mass galaxies, the greatest uncertainty arises from the proper treatment of bulge/disk separation in which to apply different $\Upsilon_*$ relations appropriate for those differing underlying stellar populations. We compare our deduced stellar masses with those deduced from {\it Spitzer} 3.6$\mu$m fluxes and stellar mass estimates in the literature using optical photometry and different $\Upsilon_*$ modeling. We find the correspondence to be excellent, arguing that rest-frame near-IR photometry is still more advantageous than other wavelengths.","['Francis Duey', 'James Schombert', 'Stacy McGaugh', 'Federico Lelli']",7.0,20.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10919,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-22
Solar modulation of AMS-02 daily proton and Helium fluxes with modified force field approximation models,"As galactic cosmic rays propagate through the turbulent plasma environment within the heliosphere, they undergo a process of diffusion, drift and energy loss, leading to a notable reduction in their flux. This is the solar modulation impact. Recently, the cosmic-ray experiment AMS-02 published daily fluxes of proton and Helium for the period from May 20, 2011 to October 29, 2019 in the rigidity interval from about 1 to 100 GV, exhibiting fine time structures that correlate with solar wind properties on daily basis. In this work, we employ three different modified force field approximation models to fit the data. By fitting to the daily proton and Helium fluxes, we get the time series of solar modulation potential. We find good agreement of data and model predictions for both proton and Helium with the same parameters in two modified force field approximation models. The results in this study verify that the modified FFA model is a valid parametrization of the GCR spectrum also at daily time scales.","['Cheng-Rui Zhu', 'Mei-Juan Wang']",11.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10922,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-22
Probing muonic force with periastron advance in binary pulsar systems,"Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.","['Zuowei Liu', 'Zi-Wei Tang']",6.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10927,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-22
Serial MultiView: an efficient approach to mitigating atmospheric spatial-structure errors for VLBI astrometry,"Atmospheric propagation errors are a main constraint on the accuracy of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. For relative astrometry, differential techniques can mitigate these errors, but their effectiveness diminishes with decreasing elevation and increasing angular separations between target and calibrator, among others. The MultiView technique addresses atmospheric spatial-structure errors by observing multiple calibrators around the target and interpolating at the target position, thereby reducing residual atmospheric errors more effectively than phase-referencing with only one calibrator. Conventional MultiView approach involves cyclically observing all calibrators and the target, fitting a phase plane from the phases of all calibrators in each cycle. This approach reduces on-target time and is restricted by the interferometer coherence time. We propose a new approach, serial MultiView, which rotates the phase plane iteratively based on the time series of calibrator residual phases. The new approach eliminates the need to observe all calibrators in each cycle, thus shortening the observing cycle and increasing the proportion of on-target time. Additionally, by incorporating time-domain information in the iterations, phase ambiguities can be accurately and automatically identified. This approach enables efficient high-accuracy differential astrometry and artifact-reduced imaging for astrophysical studies, and we provide a user-friendly tool for it.","['Jingdong Zhang', 'Bo Zhang', 'Shuangjing Xu', 'Maria J.

A new X-ray census of rotation powered pulsars,"To date, over 4,000 pulsars have been detected. In this study, we identify 231 X-ray counterparts of {\it ATNF} pulsars by performing a spatial cross-match across the {\it Chandra}, {\it XMM-Newton} observational catalogs. This dataset represents the largest sample of X-ray counterparts ever compiled, including 98 normal pulsars (NPs) and 133 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Based on this significantly expanded sample, we re-establish the correlation between X-ray luminosity and spin-down power, given by $L_{\rm X} \propto \dot{E}^{0.85\pm0.05}$ across the whole X-ray band. The strong correlation is also observed in hard X-ray band, while in soft X-ray band there is no significant correlation. Furthermore, $L_{\rm X}$ shows a strong correlation with spin period and characteristic age for NPs. For the first time, we observe a strongly positive correlation between $L_{\rm X}$ and the light cylinder magnetic field ($B_{\rm lc}$) for MSPs, with both NPs and MSPs following the relationship $L_{\rm X} \propto B_{\rm lc}^{1.14}$, consistent with the outer-gap model of pulsars that explains the mechanism of X-ray emission. Additionally, we investigate potential X-ray counterparts for GPPS pulsars, finding a lower likelihood of detection compared to {\it ATNF} pulsars.","['Yu-Jing Xu', 'Han-Long Peng', 'Shan-Shan Weng', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Ming-Yu Ge']",4.0,18.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10999,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['pulsars (1306) : general — star: neutron (1108) — X-rays: stars 1'],2025-01-22
Data-Constrained Magnetohydrodynamics Simulation of a Confined X-class Flare in NOAA Active Region 11166,"In this paper, we present a magnetohydrodynamics simulation of NOAA active region 11166 to understand the origin of a confined X-class flare that peaked at 23:23 UT on 2011 March 9. The simulation is initiated with a magnetic field extrapolated from the corresponding photospheric magnetogram using a non-force-free-field extrapolation technique. Importantly, the initial magnetic configuration identifies three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which nearly agree with the bright structures appeared in multi-wavelength observations. The Lorentz force associated with the extrapolated field self-consistently generates the dynamics that leads to the magnetic reconnections at the 3D nulls and the QSLs. These reconnections are found to contribute to the pre-flare activities and, ultimately, lead to the development of the flare ribbons. Notably, the anchored spine of the 3D null and the complete absence of flux rope in the flaring region are congruent with the confined nature of the flare. Furthermore, the simulation also suggests the role of reconnections at the 3D null with an open spine in the onset of a jet away from the flaring site.","['Sanjay Kumar', 'Pawan Kumar', 'Sadashiv', 'Sushree S.

The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars,"We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$Å) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e < 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e < 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M > 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.","['F. Cullen', 'A. C. Carnall', 'D. Scholte', 'D. J.

Explaining JWST star formation history at $z \sim 17$ by modifying $\Lambda$CDM,"Recent cosmological observations indicate a $5\sigma$ discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the $\sim 3\sigma$ level arises from different measurements of $\sigma_8$. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index $\gamma$ and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) $w_\Lambda$. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as $k$-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of $r_c\gtrsim 10^{3.5}$ Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while $\beta\sim0.1$, $K_0\gtrsim 0.9$ is favored for $k$-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS $w_\Lambda\lesssim -1$ is preferred over the quintessence.",['Oleksii Sokoliuk'],23.0,36.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11103,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Galaxies: star formation – evolution – high-redshift 1'],2025-01-22
X-ray timing and spectral characteristics of compact symmetric objects,"Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei whose high-energy emission is not well understood. We examined the X-ray characteristics of 17 bona fide CSOs using observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Among the sources with XMM-Newton observations, we found two sources, J0713+4349 and J1326+3154 to show clear evidence of variations in the soft (0.3$-$2 keV), the hard (2$-$10 keV) and the total energy (0.3$-$10 keV) bands with the normalised excess variance (F$_{var}$) as large as 1.17$\pm$0.27. Also, the F$_{var}$ is found to be larger in the hard band relative to the soft band for J1326+3154. From the analysis of the hardness ratio (HR) with count rate, we found both sources to show a harder when brighter (HWB) trend. Similarly, in the Chandra observations, we found one source, J0131+5545, to show flux variations in the total energy band (0.5$-$7 keV). We discuss possible reasons for about 82 per cent of the CSOs being non-variable. From spectral analysis, carried out in a homogeneous manner, we found the existence of obscured as well as unobscured CSOs. Three CSOs, J0111+3906, J1407+2827 and J2022+6136, were found to have the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density N$_{\rm H,z} > 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, consistent with earlier analyses. For the majority of the CSOs, the observed hard X-ray emission is expected to be dominated by their mildly relativistic jet emission. For the sources, J0713+4349, J1347+1217, J1407+2827, J1511+0518 and J2022+6136, the confirmed detection of Fe K$\alpha$ emission line suggests a significant contribution from the disk/corona.

Kinematics of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal core: A 5D Analysis for a 6D Methodology with Gaia DR3,"Using Gaia DR3 data, we examine the kinematics of the central core of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data which includes proper motions and line-of-sight velocities for member stars in addition to their projected positions. We extract a sample of bright stars that are high-probability members of Sgr. We model the distances to these stars, which is the only missing phase-space component measurement from our 5D sample, highlighting how their corresponding uncertainties propagate to affect the kinematics. Using line-of-sight velocity data only, which are not affected by the distance uncertainties, and assuming a jeans-based equilibrium analysis, we obtain a velocity anisotropy of $\beta_a = -2.24 \pm 1.99$, which implies a system with tangentially-biased orbits. With the full 5D data, we project that the data will significantly improve upon measurements of the log-slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Tests with mock distance data show an improvement of anisotropy errors of approximately an order of magnitude, and log slope at the half light radius of approximately half an order of magnitude.","['Isabelle S.

Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. III. Astrophysical implications of second-order and dotriacontapole terms,"We study the long-term evolution of selected hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity. We employ analytic equations derived in Paper II for the evolution of orbit-averaged orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits, which include two classes of contributions. One class consists of linear-order contributions, including quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole and dotriacontapole orders, the latter scaling as $\epsilon^6$, where $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. The second class consists of contributions at {\em second} order in the fundamental perturbation parameter; they contribute at orders $\epsilon^{9/2}$, $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$ and $\epsilon^{6}$. For well studied triples such as star-planet systems perturbed by a low-mass third body (``hot Jupiters''), second-order and dotriacontapole (SOD) effects induce only small corrections. For stellar-mass binaries orbiting supermassive black holes, SOD corrections can suppress orbital flips that are generated by purely first-order effects. Planets orbiting binary star systems are susceptible to significant variations in the planetary semimajor axis, an effect that does not occur at first perturbative order. SOD effects in triple black hole systems can induce migrations of the eccentricity to significantly larger values than predicted by first-order perturbations, with implications for the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of the inner binary. We also show that in most cases, evolutions using our SOD equations are in better agreement with those from direct integration of the N-body equations of motion than those from first-order perturbations through hexadecapole order.","['Landen Conway', 'Clifford M.

The evolution of metallicity gradients in galaxies from cosmological simulations,"Tracing the cosmic path of galaxies requires an understanding of their chemical enrichment and merging histories. One of the most important constraints is the internal structure of galaxies, notably the internal distribution of elements acting as fossils in extra-galactic archaeology. Using our cosmological chemodynamical simulations, which include all relevant physical processes and the latest nucleosynthesis yields, we investigate the evolution of radial metallicity gradients of stellar populations and the interstellar medium within each galaxy. This work explores the role of supernova feedback on the metallicity gradients by comparing three feedback models, ejecting energy in thermal, stochastic and mechanical forms. At $z=0$, the mechanical feedback model produces the gradient--mass relations of stars and gas both in excellent agreement with observations; gradients are the steepest at intermediate-mass ($M_*\sim10^{10}M_\odot$) and become flatter in massive galaxies probably by major mergers. For each model, we predict similar gradient--mass relations up to $z=4$ and find that the mechanical feedback model gives flatter gradients of both stars and gas for lower-mass galaxies ($M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$) possibly due to the suppression of star formation and metal ejection by stellar feedback. With all feedback models, most galaxies have negative gas-phase metallicity gradients up to $z=5$, suggesting an inside-out growth, which is consistent with other cosmological simulations but not with recent observations at $z\sim1$--2.5. We find a mild redshift evolution of gradients up to $z=4$, while there seems to be an evolutionary transition at $z=5$ where the metallicity gradients become steep for gas and stars.","['Dyna Ibrahim', 'Chiaki Kobayashi']",17.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11209,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,MNRAS,,['galaxies: abundances – galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution – methods: numerical'],2025-01-22
Impact of the returning radiation on X-ray reflection spectroscopy measurements: the case of Galactic black holes,"The effect of the returning radiation has long been ignored in the analysis of the reflection spectra of Galactic black holes and active galactic nuclei and only recently has been implemented in the relxill package. Here we present a study on the impact of the returning radiation on the estimate of the parameters of Galactic black holes. We consider high-quality NuSTAR spectra of three Galactic black holes (GX 339-4, Swift J1658.2-4242, and MAXI J1535-571) and we fit the data with the lamppost model in the latest version of relxill, first without including the returning radiation and then including the returning radiation. We do not find any significant difference in the estimate of the parameters of these systems between the two cases, even if all three sources are fast-rotating black holes and for two sources the estimate of the height of the corona is very low, two ingredients that should maximize the effect of the returning radiation. We discuss our results and the approximations in relxill.","['Kexin Huang', 'Honghui Liu', 'Cosimo Bambi', 'Javier A.

"Modeling the Solar Transition Region: Effects of Spatial Resolution on the Atmospheric Structure, Emission and Non-Equilibrium Ionization","The solar transition region (TR) is a narrow interface between the chromosphere and corona, where emitted radiation contains critical information pertinent to coronal heating processes. We conducted 2-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations using adaptive mesh refinement to spatially resolve the fine structure of the TR while simultaneously capturing the larger-scale dynamics originating from surface convection. The time evolution of ionization fractions for oxygen ions is computed alongside the simulations. A minimum grid size of 1.25 km is achieved in the TR, enabling adequate resolution of the upper TR (log$_{10}T \gtrsim$ 5), although the lower TR (log$_{10}T \lesssim$ 5) remains under-resolved. Doppler shifts and nonthermal widths synthesized from TR lines exhibit convergence with grid sizes as coarse as 40 km, though some discrepancies persist between our results and observed TR line properties. A notable enhancement in emission from \ion{O}{6} lines, converging at a grid size of 2.5 km, shows an intensity 1.2 times that expected under ionization equilibrium, attributable to shock interactions with the TR. While model refinements are still required, our ability to resolve the TR offers critical insights into TR line characteristics arising from non-equilibrium ionization states, advancing our understanding of the coronal heating problem.",['Takuma Matsumoto'],8.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11237,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Solar Corona(1483) — Solar transition region (1532) — Ultraviolet astronomy(1736) — Magnetohydrodynamics(1964) — Ionization(2068) 1'],2025-01-22
High spectral resolution observations of Uranus' near-IR thermospheric $H_2$ emission spectrum using the IGRINS spectrograph during the 2018 and 2023 apparition,"Ground-based near-IR observations have revealed that Uranus anomalously hot upper atmosphere, detected by Voyager 2, has been steadily cooling. The observed $H_3^+$ and $H_2$ emission-line spectra probe Uranus' ionosphere and thermosphere, respectively. Previous observations have shown that the cooling has continued well past the 2007 vernal equinox, when the seasonal solar forcing turned positive, resulting in net heating of the IAU northern hemisphere. Most of them, especially for $H_2$, were obtained at moderate spectral resolution, R ~1000 to 3000, which admits more sky background, with its associated noise, per spectral resolution element relative to spectrographs having higher spectral resolution. We report the first instance of high spectral resolution being used to observe Uranus' fundamental-band, rovibrational quadrupole $H_2$ emission spectrum; where the sky background is suppressed and narrow planetary emission lines stand out against the planetary continuum. The IGRINS spectrograph with spectral resolution R ~45,000 was used to observe Uranus in the K-band on Oct 26 & 27, 2018 at the Lowell Discovery Telescope, and on Nov 27, 2023 at Gemini South. These observations reveal rovibrational temperatures of Uranus' thermosphere of 542+/-25 K and 397+/-32 K at these two epochs, respectively. The consecutive-nights at elevated temperature observed at the Discovery Telescope suggest that Uranus' near-IR $H_2$ aurora was detected over each of the northern and southern magnetic poles, respectively.

Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA,"Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.","['Jonas El Gammal', 'Aya Ghaleb', 'Gabriele Franciolini', 'Theodoros Papanikolaou', 'Marco Peloso', 'Gabriele Perna', 'Mauro Pieroni', 'Angelo Ricciardone', 'Robert Rosati', 'Gianmassimo Tasinato', 'Matteo Braglia', 'Jacopo Fumagalli', ""Jun'ya Kume"", 'Enrico Morgante', 'Germano Nardini', 'Davide Racco', 'Sébastien Renaux-Petel', 'Hardi Veermäe', 'Denis Werth', 'Ivonne Zavala']",31.0,95.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11320,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-22
Observational signatures of mixing-induced cooling in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,"Cool ($\approx 10^4$K), dense material permeates the hot ($\approx 10^6$K), tenuous solar corona in form of coronal condensations, for example prominences and coronal rain. As the solar atmosphere evolves, turbulence can drive mixing between the condensations and the surrounding corona, with the mixing layer exhibiting an enhancement in emission from intermediate temperature ($\approx10^5$K) spectral lines, which is often attributed to turbulent heating within the mixing layer. However, radiative cooling is highly efficient at intermediate temperatures and numerical simulations have shown that radiative cooling can far exceed turbulent heating in prominence-corona mixing scenarios. As such the mixing layer can have a net loss of thermal energy, i.e., the mixing layer is cooling rather than heating. Here, we investigate the observational signatures of cooling processes in Kelvin-Helmholtz mixing between a prominence thread and the surrounding solar corona through 2D numerical simulations. Optically thin emission is synthesised for Si IV, along with optically thick emission for H$\alpha$, Ca II K and Mg II h using Lightweaver The Mg II h probes the turbulent mixing layer, whereas H$\alpha$ and Ca II K form within the thread and along its boundary respectively. As the mixing evolves, intermediate temperatures form leading to an increase in Si IV emission, which coincides with increased radiative losses. The simulation is dominated by cooling in the mixing layer, rather than turbulent heating, and yet enhanced emission in warm lines is produced. As such, an observational signature of decreased emission in cooler lines and increased emission in hotter lines may be a signature of mixing, rather than an implication of heating.","['Ben Snow', 'Chris Osborne', 'Andrew Hillier']",11.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11324,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,MNRAS,,"['tenuousso- larcoronaintheformofsolarprominences/filaments(Parenti2014)', 'prominences – instabilities – radiative transfer 1 INTRODUCTION Cool', 'coronal rain (Antolin 2020)', 'Sun: corona – Sun: filaments', 'and spicules (Beckers 1968', 'densematerialisoftenobservedwithininthehot']",2025-01-22

Revisiting the Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Strong Jet Sources,"Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (LBLs) and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (IBLs) to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus (RL-AGNs) with a powerful jet towards the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity (FP) for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation is $L_{\rm{R,int}}\propto L_{\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the jet-dominate mode, the intrinsic FP is $\log L_{\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\pm0.06)\log L_{\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\pm0.10)\log M_{\rm{BH}}-(3.77\pm2.11)$, which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of Jet+SSD. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio--X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources have not a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.","['Qing-Chen. Long', 'Ai-Jun. Dong', 'Qin-Jun. Zhi', 'Lun-Hua.

Phenomenological gravitational waveforms for core-collapse supernovae,"Galactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are a target for current generation gravitational wave detectors with an expected rate of 1-3 per century. The development of data analysis methods used for their detection relies deeply on the availability of waveform templates. However, realistic numerical simulations producing such waveforms are computationally expensive (millions of CPU hours and $10^2-10^3$~GB of memory), and only a few tens of them are available nowadays in the literature. We have developed a novel parametrized phenomenological waveform generator for CCSNe, ccphen v4, that reproduces the morphology of numerical simulation waveforms with low computational cost ($\sim 10$~ms CPU time and a few MB of memory use). For the first time, the phenomenological waveforms include polarization and the effect of several oscillation modes in the proto-neutron star.

Dark Matter Effects on the Curvature of Neutron Stars within the new Quarkyonic Model Coupled with Relativistic Mean Field Theory,"For the first time, we analyze the impact of dark matter (DM) on the curvature properties of quarkyonic neutron stars (NS) using a hybrid model based on quarkyonic-effective field theory within the relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) framework. This study examines the radial variation of curvature components, including the Ricci scalar ($\cal{R}$), Ricci tensor ($\cal{J}$), Kretschmann scalar ($\cal{K}$), and Weyl tensor ($\cal{W}$), under different DM admixtures. These components offer critical insights into the spacetime geometry and gravitational field strength within the star. The analysis spans canonical mass (1.4 $M_{\odot}$) and maximum mass configurations, varying key parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$) and QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which influence matter transitions and quark confinement. Our results reveal that DM and quarkyonic matter (QM) significantly affect the star's curvature. Central curvature values, particularly $\cal{R}$, $\cal{J}$, and $\cal{K}$, increase with DM due to higher central densities but decrease with stronger QM effects. Stiffer EOSs yield smoother curvature profiles, while softer EOSs influenced by DM redistribute curvature more dynamically. DM softens the EOS, reducing central pressure and compactness, whereas higher $n_t$ values enhance compactness and central pressures. These findings show that dark matter plays a key role in shaping the curvature of quarkyonic neutron stars, offering new insights into compact objects with exotic matter.","['Jeet Amrit Pattnaik', 'D.

Long-term evolution of Sco X-1: implications for the current spin frequency and ellipticity of the neutron star,"Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extra-solar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency ($\nu$) and the surface magnetic field ($B$), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young ($\sim7\times10^6$ yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to $\sim 1.4-1.6~{\rm M}_\odot$. Our computations reveal a rapid $B$ decay, with the maximum current value of $\sim 1.8\times10^8$ G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current $\nu$ value is $\sim 550$ Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, $\nu$ will exceed an observed cut-off frequency of $\sim 730$ Hz, and perhaps even the NS break-up frequency, in the future, without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment ($Q$) to avoid this is $\sim (2-3)\times10^{37}$ g cm$^2$, corresponding to a CW strain of $\sim 10^{-26}$. Our estimation of current $\nu$ values can improve the CW search sensitivity.","['Abhijnan Kar', 'Pulkit Ojha', 'Sudip Bhattacharyya']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11475,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,The Astrophysical Journal,,['Gravitational Waves (678) — Neutron stars (1108) — Low-mass x-ray binary stars (939) — Accretion (14) — X-ray binary stars (1811) 1'],2025-01-22
MIDIS: Quantifying the AGN component of X-ray-detected galaxies,"We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6$ \mu m$) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of $\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}^{\rm 0.5-7keV})$=42.04$\pm$0.22 erg $\rm s^{-1}$. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of $z \simeq 0.5-3$. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2$\mu m$ ranging from $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$0.9. At high X-ray luminosities ($\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}$)>43 erg $\rm s^{-1}$) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2$ \mu m$ point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2$ \mu m$ emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission.

Comparison of Herschel and ArT\'eMiS observations of massive filaments,"Context: OMC-3 in the Orion A Cloud is a nearby, high-mass star-forming region, and therefore ideal to study massive filaments in detail. Aims: We analyze how the inclusion of higher-resolution data changes the estimates of the filament properties and test the robustness of filament fitting routines. Methods. ArTéMiS and Herschel data are combined to create high-resolution images. Column densities and temperatures are estimated with modified blackbody fitting. The nearby OMC-3 cloud is compared to the more distant G202 and G17 clouds. We compare the OMC-3 cloud as it appears at Herschel and ArTéMiS resolution. Results. Column densities of dense clumps in OMC-3 are higher in combined ArTéMiS and Herschel data (FWHM 8.5""), when compared to Herschel-only data (FWHM 20""). Estimated filament widths are smaller in the combined maps, and also show signs of further fragmentation when observed with the ArTéMiS resolution. In the analysis of Herschel data the estimated filament widths are correlated with the distance of the field. Conclusions. Median filament FWHM in OMC-3 at higher resolution is 0.05 pc, but 0.1 pc with the Herschel resolution, 0.3 pc in G202 and 1.0 pc in G17, also at the Herschel resolution. It is unclear what causes the steep relation between distance and filament FWHM, but likely reasons include the effect of the limited telescope resolution combined with existing hierarchical structure, and convolution of large-scale background structures within the ISM. Estimates of the asymptotic power-law index of the filament profile function p is high. When fit with the Plummer function, the individual parameters of the profile function are degenerate, while the FWHM is better constrained. OMC-3 shows negative kurtosis, and all but OMC-3 at the Herschel resolution some asymmetry.","['Emma Mannfors', 'Mika Juvela', 'Tie Liu', 'Veli-Matti Pelkonen']",16.0,30.0,9.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11507,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['G17', 'Monoceros', 'G208', 'G202', 'Orion – ISM: clouds – Methods: observational – Infrared: ISM 1', 'ISM: individual objects: G16']",2025-01-22

Investigating the complex absorbers of Mrk 766 with XMM-Newton,"Aims. We examine the high energy resolution X-ray spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 766 using 4 observations taken with XMM-Newton in 2005, to investigate the properties of the complex ionised absorber / emitter along the line of sight, as well as absorption by dust intrinsic to the source.Methods. We make use of the high-energy resolution RGS spectrum to infer the properties of the intervening matter. We also use the spectrum obtained by EPIC-pn and the photometric measurements of OM to obtain the spectral energy distribution of the source, necessary for the photoionisation modelling of the ionised outflow.Results. The warm absorber in Mrk 766 consists of two phases of photoionisation. In addition to these two warm absorber components with $\log\xi\sim 2.15$ and $\log\xi\sim -0.58$, we find evidence of absorption by a collisionally ionised component ($T\sim51$ eV). We discuss the implication of this additional component in light of theoretical predictions. Moreover, we detect signs of absorption by a dusty medium with $N_\text{dust}\sim 7.29\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. Finally the relatively weak emission features in the spectrum seem to be unrelated to the absorbers and probably originated by an out-of sight-line ionised plasma.","['T. Matamoro Zatarain', 'E.

The JCMT Gould Belt Survey: First results from the Corona Australis molecular cloud and evidence of variable dust emissivity indices in the Coronet region,"We present 450$\mu$m and 850$\mu$m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450$\mu$m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850$\mu$m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature $T$, dust emissivity index $\beta$ and column density $N({\rm H}_2)$ across the Coronet. We find that $\beta$ varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring $\beta = 1.55 \pm 0.35$ in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of $\beta$ is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of $T-\beta$ fitting degeneracy and $^{12}$CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m data on the measured $\beta$ values.","['Kate Pattle', 'David Bresnahan', 'Derek Ward-Thompson', 'Helen Kirk', 'Jason M.

Illustrating the consequences of a misuse of $\sigma_8$ in cosmology,"The parameter $\sigma_8$ represents the root-mean-square (rms) mass fluctuations on a scale of $R_8=8h^{-1}$ Mpc and is commonly used to quantify the amplitude of matter fluctuations at linear cosmological scales. However, the dependence of $R_8$ on $h$ complicates direct comparisons of $\sigma_8$ values obtained under different assumptions about $H_0$, since $\sigma_8$ in such cases characterizes the amount of structure at different physical scales. This issue arises both when comparing $\sigma_8$ values from fitting analyses of cosmological models with differing $H_0$ posteriors, and when contrasting constraints from experiments with different priors on $H_0$. As first noted by Ariel G. Sánchez in PRD 102, 123511 (2020), quantifying the growth tension using $\sigma_8$ can introduce substantial biases and couple the growth and Hubble tensions in an intricate way. To address these challenges, Sánchez proposed an alternative parameter, $\sigma_{12}$, defined as the rms mass fluctuations at a scale of $12$ Mpc, which is independent of $h$. Although Sánchez's work was published five years ago and other authors have since highlighted the limitations of $\sigma_8$, much of the cosmological community -- including large collaborations -- continues to rely on this parameter instead of adopting $\sigma_{12}$, seemingly due only to historical considerations. In this work, we illustrate the biases introduced by the use of $\sigma_8$ through some clear examples, aiming to motivate the community to transition from $\sigma_8$ to $\sigma_{12}$. We show that the bias found in models with large values of $H_0$ is more prominent, artificially complicating the search for a model that can resolve the Hubble tension without exacerbating the growth tension. We argue that the worsening of the growth tension in these models is much less pronounced than previously thought or may even be nonexistent.","['Matteo Forconi', 'Arianna Favale', 'Adrià Gómez-Valent']",9.0,24.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11571,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-22
Gamma ray emission from embedded young massive star clusters unveiled by Fermi-LAT,"Massive star clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNR) to reach the highest energy end of the Galactic CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses through collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies. A handful of star clusters has been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in these environments. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters and estimate the contribution of these types of sources to the bulk of CRs.

B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): III. Grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in G34.43+0.24 using polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2,"Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission due to aligned non-spherical grains helps us to trace magnetic field (B-field) morphology in molecular clouds and to study grain alignment mechanisms. In this work, we study grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in a filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43+0.24 using thermal dust polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu\text{m}$. We study in three sub-regions as North harboring MM3 core, Center harboring MM1 and MM2 cores and South having no core. We find the decrease in polarization fraction P with increasing total intensity and gas column density, known as polarization hole. To disentangle the effect of magnetic field tangling on the polarization hole, we estimate the polarization angle dispersion function. We find depolarizations in North and Center regions are due to decrease in net alignment efficiency of grains but in South region, effect of magnetic field tangling is significant to cause depolarization. To test whether RAdiative Torque (RAT) mechanism can reproduce the observational data, we calculate minimum alignment and disruption sizes of grains using RAT theory and our study finds that RAT alignment mechanism can explain the depolarizations in North and Center regions where B-field tangling effect is less important, except for core regions. We find hints of RAdiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) in the core regions of MM3 in North, MM1 and MM2 in Center. We also find that the high P value of around 8-20% in the outer regions of the filament can be explained potentially by magnetically enhanced RAT alignment mechanism.","['Saikhom Pravash', 'Archana Soam', 'Pham Ngoc Diep', 'Thiem Hoang', 'Nguyen Bich Ngoc', 'Le Ngoc Tram']",19.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11634,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,['Interstellar dust (836)'],2025-01-22
Classification of HI Galaxy Profiles Using Unsupervised Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis and Methodological Cases of Studies,"Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. The 21 cm neutral atomic hydrogen - HI spectral line maps the gas kinematics within galaxies, providing key insights into interactions, galactic structure, and star formation processes. With new radio instruments, the volume and complexity of data is increasing. To analyze and classify integrated HI spectral profiles in a efficient way, this work presents a framework that integrates Machine Learning techniques, combining unsupervised methods and CNNs. To this end, we apply our framework to a selected subsample of 318 spectral HI profiles of the CIG and 30.780 profiles from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey catalogue. Data pre-processing involved the Busyfit package and iterative fitting with polynomial, Gaussian, and double-Lorentzian models. Clustering methods, including K-means, spectral clustering, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, were used for feature extraction and to bootstrap classification we applied K-NN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers, optimizing accuracy with CNN. Additionally, we introduced a 2D model of the profiles to enhance classification by adding dimensionality to the data. Three 2D models were generated based on transformations and normalised versions to quantify the level of asymmetry. These methods were tested in a previous analytical classification study conducted by the Analysis of the Interstellar Medium in Isolated Galaxies group. This approach enhances classification accuracy and aims to establish a methodology that could be applied to data analysis in future surveys conducted with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), currently under construction.

Nonlinear analysis of gravitational instability in a 3D gaseous disc,"Astrophysical discs which are sufficiently massive and cool are linearly unstable to the formation of axisymmetric structures. In practice, linearly stable discs of surface density slightly below the threshold needed for this instability often form spiral structures, and can subsequently fragment or exhibit a state of self-sustained turbulence, depending on how rapidly the disc cools. This has raised the question of how such turbulence is possible in the linearly stable regime. We suggest a nonlinear mechanism for this phenomenon. We find analytically weakly nonlinear axisymmetric subcritical solitary equilibria which exist in linearly stable 3D discs that are close to the instability threshold. The energy of these 'soliton' solutions is only slightly higher than that of a uniform disc, and the structures themselves are expected to be unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. In this way, these subcritical solitary equilibria highlight a nonlinear instability and provide a possible pathway to a turbulent state in linearly stable discs.","['Joshua J. Brown', 'Gordon I.

Where in the Milky Way Do Exoplanets Preferentially Form?,"Exoplanets are detected around stars of different ages and birthplaces within the Galaxy. The aim of this work is to infer the Galactic birth radii ($r_\text{birth}$) of stars and, consequently, their planets, with the ultimate goal of studying the Galactic aspects of exoplanet formation. We used photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data to estimate the stellar ages of two samples of stars hosting planets and, for comparison, a sample of stars without detected planets. The $r_\text{birth}$ of exoplanets were inferred by projecting stars back to their birth positions based on their estimated age and metallicity [Fe/H]. We find that stars hosting planets have higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ compared to stars without detected planets. In particular, stars hosting high-mass planets show higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ than stars hosting low-mass planets. We show that the formation efficiency of planets, calculated as the relative frequency of planetary systems, decreases with the galactocentric distance, which relationship is stronger for high-mass planets than for low-mass planets. Additionally, we find that (i) the formation efficiency of high-mass planets increases with time and encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; (ii) the formation efficiency of low-mass planets shows a slight increase between the ages of 4 and 8 Gyr and also encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; and (iii) stars without detected planets appear to form at larger galactocentric distances over time. We conclude that the formation of exoplanets throughout the Galaxy follows the Galactic chemical evolution, for which our results are in agreement with the observed negative interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient and its enrichment and flattening with time at any radius.","['Joana Teixeira', 'Vardan Adibekyan', 'Diego Bossini']",9.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11660,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",,"Astronomische Nachrichten, e20240076, (2025)","['imply- ing that planet formation is a universal process that occurs around the majority of stars (e', 'stars: kinematics and dynamics – stars: solar-type – (stars:) planetary systems – planets and satellites: formation 1INTRODUCTION Over 5500 exoplanets have been discovered thus far']",2025-01-22
A One-Dimensional Energy Balance Model Parameterization for the Formation of CO2 Ice on the Surfaces of Eccentric Extrasolar Planets,"Eccentric planets may spend a significant portion of their orbits at large distances from their host stars, where low temperatures can cause atmospheric CO2 to condense out onto the surface, similar to the polar ice caps on Mars. The radiative effects on the climates of these planets throughout their orbits would depend on the wavelength-dependent albedo of surface CO2 ice that may accumulate at or near apoastron and vary according to the spectral energy distribution of the host star. To explore these possible effects, we incorporated a CO2 ice-albedo parameterization into a one-dimensional energy balance climate model. With the inclusion of this parameterization, our simulations demonstrated that F-dwarf planets require 29% more orbit-averaged flux to thaw out of global water ice cover compared with simulations that solely use a traditional pure water ice-albedo parameterization. When no eccentricity is assumed, and host stars are varied, F-dwarf planets with higher bond albedos relative to their M-dwarf planet counterparts require 30% more orbit-averaged flux to exit a water snowball state. Additionally, the intense heat experienced at periastron aids eccentric planets in exiting a snowball state with a smaller increase in instellation compared with planets on circular orbits; this enables eccentric planets to exhibit warmer conditions along a broad range of instellation. This study emphasizes the significance of incorporating an albedo parameterization for the formation of CO2 ice into climate models to accurately assess the habitability of eccentric planets, as we show that, even at moderate eccentricities, planets with Earth-like atmospheres can reach surface temperatures cold enough for the condensation of CO2 onto their surfaces, as can planets receiving low amounts of instellation on circular orbits.","['Vidya Venkatesan', 'Aomawa L.

Bridging the Gap: OPTICAM Reveals the Hidden Spin of the WZ Sge Star GOTO 065054.49+593624.51,"WZ Sge stars are highly evolved accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) exhibiting remarkably large amplitude outbursts (a.k.a. super-outbursts), typically followed by short rebrightenings/echo outbursts. These systems have some of the lowest mass transfer rates among AWDs, making even low magnetic fields dynamically important. Such magnetic fields are often invoked to explain the phenomenology observed in these systems, such as their X-ray luminosity and long periods of quiescence (30+ years). However, the detection of these is very elusive given the quenching of the accretion columns during outburst and the low luminosity of these systems during quiescence. Here we present high-cadence multi-band observations with {\it OPTICAM} of the recent outburst of the recently discovered WZ Sge star GOTO065054.49+593624.51, during the end of the main outburst and the dip in-between rebrightenings, covering 2 orders of magnitude in brightness.

Less Wound and More Asymmetric: JWST Confirms the Evolution of Spiral Structure in Galaxies at $z \lesssim 3$,"Spiral galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe. However the properties of spiral arms in them are still not well studied, and there is even less information concerning spiral structure in distant galaxies. We aim to measure the most general parameters of spiral arms in remote galaxies and trace their changes with redshift. We perform photometric decomposition, including spiral arms, for 159 galaxies from the HST COSMOS and JWST CEERS and JADES surveys, which are imaged in optical and near-infrared rest-frame wavelengths. We confirm that, in our representative sample of spiral galaxies, the pitch angles increase, and the azimuthal lengths decrease with increasing redshift, implying that the spiral structure becomes more tightly wound over time. For the spiral-to-total luminosity ratio and the spiral width-to-disc scale length ratio, we find that band-shifting effects can be as significant as, or even stronger than, evolutionary effects. Additionally, we find that spiral structure becomes more asymmetric at higher redshifts.","['Ilia V. Chugunov', 'Alexander A. Marchuk', 'Aleksandr V.

Tracing the galaxy-halo connection with galaxy clustering in COSMOS-Web from z = 0.1 to z ~ 12,"We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 12$ using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at $z \ge 10$ and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at $z \ge 2.5$ best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z > 10.5 with $\log(M_\star / M_\odot) \ge 8.85$ are hosted by halos with $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) $M_\star / (f_b M_{\rm h}) $ up to 1 dex higher than at $z \le 1$. The high galaxy bias at $z \ge 8$ suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at $z \ge 10.5$, decreasing until $z \sim 2 - 3$, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-$z$ galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that $z > 8$ galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At $z \sim 2 - 3$ and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.","['Louise Paquereau', 'Clotilde Laigle', 'Henry Joy McCracken', 'Marko Shuntov', 'Olivier Ilbert', 'Hollis B.

Cosmic Large-Scale Structure Formation from Newtonian Particle Dynamics,"We present results for the cosmic non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum based on the analytical formalism developed in [1] which allows us to study cosmic structure formation based on Newtonian particle dynamics in phase-space. This framework provides a field-theory approach to a perturbative solution of the BBGKY-hierarchy where the resulting loop-expansion of the theory introduces a natural truncation criterion. We show that we are able to reproduce structure growth on large scales $k \leq 0.2 \mathrm{h}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to very high precision while on small and intermediate scales we find deviations of the order of $10\%$ from current numerical simulations.

GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$,"Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$Å); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$<0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun<0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (<5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.","['Seiji Fujimoto', 'Rohan P.

Gravitational Wave Decoupling in Retrograde Circumbinary Disks,"We present a study of the late-time interaction between supermassive black hole binaries and retrograde circumbinary disks during the period of gravitational wave-driven inspiral. While mergers in prograde disks have received extensive study, retrograde disks offer distinct dynamics that could promote mergers and produce unique observational signatures. Through numerical simulations, we explore the process of binary-disk decoupling, where the binary's orbital decay rate is faster than the disk's viscous response rate. We find the point of decoupling to be comparable in prograde and retrograde disks, suggesting that any associated electromagnetic (EM) signatures will be produced at comparable times preceding merger. However, we find smaller central cavities for retrograde disks, likely leading to higher-frequency EM emissions and shorter post-merger rebrightening timescales compared to their prograde counterparts. Additionally, we identify quasi-periodic flaring due to instabilities unique to low-viscosity retrograde disks, which may produce distinctive EM signatures.","[""David O'Neill"", 'Christopher Tiede', ""Daniel J.

The centimeter emission from planet-forming disks in Taurus,"The last decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the characterization of the (sub-)millimeter emission from planet-forming disks. Instead, the study of the (sub-)centimeter emission has made more limited progress, to the point that only a few exceptional disk-bearing objects have been characterized in the centimeter regime. This work takes a broad view of the centimeter emission from a large sample with VLA observations that is selected from previous ALMA surveys of more representative disks in brightness and extent. We report on the detection and characterization of flux at centimeter wavelengths from 21 sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Complemented by literature and archival data, the entire photometry from 0.85 mm to 6 cm is fitted by a two-component model that determines the ubiquitous presence of free-free emission entangled with the dust emission. The flux density of the free-free emission is found to scale with the accretion rate but is independent of the outer disk morphology depicted by ALMA. The dust emission at 2 cm is still appreciable, and offers the possibility to extract an unprecedented large set of dust spectral indices in the centimeter regime. A pronounced change between the median millimeter indices (2.3) and centimeter indices (2.8) suggests that a large portion of the disk emission is optically thick up to 3 mm. The comparison of both indices and fluxes with the ALMA disk extent indicates that this portion can be as large as 40 au, and suggests that the grain population within this disk region that emits the observed centimeter emission is similar in disks with different size and morphology. All these results await confirmation and dedicated dust modeling once facilities like ngVLA or SKA-mid are able to resolve the centimeter emission from planet-forming disks and disentangle the various components.","['Antonio Garufi', 'Carlos Carrasco-Gonzalez', 'Enrique Macias', 'Leonardo Testi', 'Pietro Curone', 'Luca Ricci', 'Stefano Facchini', 'Feng Long', 'Carlo F.

Probing axion-like particles through the gamma-ray production from cosmic-ray scattering in the Milky Way dark matter halo,"Axion-like particles (ALP) are promising candidates to comprise all the dark matter in the universe. We investigate the ALP couplings to photons and electrons via astrophysical measurements through the search for very-high-energy gamma rays arising from high-energy cosmic-ray scattering off ALP populating the halo of the Milky Way. We show that gamma-ray signals from ALP couplings to photons and electrons via inverse Primakoff and Compton processes respectively, can be probed by very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray ground-based observatories, providing an alternative and complementary avenue to probe ALP couplings in the eV mass range. Sensitivities of current and near-future ground-based gamma-ray observatories improves upon one order of magnitude the current constraints from gamma-ray satellite experiments for the ALP-photon couplings in the region of masses below 10$^{-9}$ GeV. Their sensitivities reached on the ALP-electron couplings allow probing masses below 10$^{-8}$ GeV, which are lower than the masses probed in gamma-ray satellite experiments.","['Victor P.

AstroPix: A Pixelated HVCMOS Sensor for Space-Based Gamma-Ray Measurement,"A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more.

AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2).

Atmospheric dynamics of the hypergiant RW Cep during the Great Dimming,"The hypergiant RW Cep is one of the largest stars in our galaxy. The evolution and mass loss of such stars has profound effects on their surrounding regions and the galaxy as a whole. Between 2020 and 2024, RW Cep experienced a historic mass-loss event known as the Great Dimming. This study provides a spectroscopic analysis of RW Cep during the Great Dimming. We examine its atmospheric dynamics and place it in the context of the star's variability behaviour since the early 2000s. We conducted high-cadence spectroscopic observations of RW Cep during the dimming event using the Tartu Observatory 1.5-meter telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope. We analysed the atmospheric dynamics by measuring the radial velocities and line depths of Fe I and other spectral lines. The radial velocities of the Fe I lines reveal a vertical velocity gradient of 10-20 km/s in the atmosphere, correlating with the strength of the spectral lines. Stronger lines, formed in higher atmospheric layers, have higher radial velocities. We measured the systemic velocity at -50.3 km/s. During the dimming, radial velocities were affected by additional emission from the ejected gas, which was blue-shifted relative to the absorption lines. Post-dimming, we observed large-scale atmospheric motions with amplitude ~25 km/s. Strong resonance lines of Ba II, K I, Na I and Ca I showed stable central emission components at -56 km/s, likely of circumstellar origin.","['A. Kasikov', 'I. Kolka', 'A. Aret', 'T. Eenmäe', 'S. P.

Constraints on the $z\sim6-13$ intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies,"JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z>5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z>10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N>15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($>0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (<500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z>9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.","['Charlotte A.

Mapping the Active Galactic Nucleus Effects on the Stellar and Gas Properties of NGC 5806,"It is commonly accepted that active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a strong impact upon the evolution of their host galaxies, but the processes by which they do so are not fully understood. We aim to further the understanding of AGN feeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially-resolved spectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC 5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical emission line fluxes throughout the central 8 x 8 kpc$^2$ of the galaxy. We use emission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas excitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the average stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and dynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear ring, with a projected radius of about 400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are driven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the central ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas excitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the extended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.","['Sophie L.

The TW Hydrae Association is a cluster chain of Sco-Cen,"The TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is a young local association (YLA) about 50 pc from the Sun, offering a unique opportunity to study star and planet formation processes in detail. We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and age, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial velocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them into TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805 members) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\sigma$ Cen, TWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in regions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster chain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's elongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential rotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and will dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings unveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that clusters such as $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were forged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as $\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed differently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\alpha$ Persei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over the past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures emerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky Way. Crucially, their formation in regions with intense stellar feedback may have influenced planet formation in these systems.","['N. Miret-Roig', 'J. Alves', 'S. Ratzenböck', 'P. A. B. Galli', 'H.

I was invited to present my own biased view of the present and the future of modeling eclipsing binary stars. In this contribution I attempt to make a clear distinction between approaches that are suited to individual objects and approaches that aim to deliver bulk results for large datasets. I stress that our motivation should be different: individual system analysis is warranted whenever there is potential to propose or improve our understanding of the underlying physics, while bulk analysis should be used to probe stellar formation and evolution channels.

The influence of chromospheric activity on line formation,"One of the primary sources of stellar spectral variability is magnetic activity. While our current understanding of chromospheric activity is largely derived from specific lines sensitive to chromospheric heating, such as the Ca II HK doublet, previous observational studies have shown that other spectral lines are also affected. To investigate the influence of activity on line formation in greater detail, we constructed a set of stellar models for hypothetical G2 dwarf stars with varying levels of activity and calculated their synthetic spectra. A comparison of these spectra revealed two spectral regions most significantly impacted by activity: approximately 3300-4400 A and 5250-5500 A. By calculating the total contribution function of the lines, we determined that the emergence of a secondary chromospheric contribution to line formation is the primary mechanism driving these changes. Based on our calculations and analysis, we compiled a list of transition lines and their corresponding changes due to chromospheric activity. This list could serve as a valuable tool for selecting spectral lines applicable to a wide range of astrophysical studies.","['Mariela C. Vieytes', 'Lily L.

Disentangling stellar atmospheric parameters in astronomical spectra using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks,"A method based on Generative Adversaria! Networks (GANs) is developed for disentangling the physical (effective temperature and gravity) and chemical (metallicity, overabundance of a-elements with respect to iron) atmospheric properties in astronomical spectra. Using a projection of the stellar spectra, commonly called latent space, in which the contribution dueto one or several main stellar physicochemical properties is minimised while others are enhanced, it was possible to maximise the information related to certain properties, which can then be extracted using artificial neural networks (ANN) as regressors with higher accuracy than a reference method based on the use of ANN trained with the original spectra. Methods. Our model utilises autoencoders, comprising two artificial neural networks: an encoder anda decoder which transform input data into a low-dimensional representation known as latent space. It also uses discriminators, which are additional neural networks aimed at transforming the traditional autoencoder training into an adversaria! approach, to disentangle or reinforce the astrophysical parameters from the latent space. The GANDALF tool is described. It was developed to define, train, and test our GAN model with a web framework to show how the disentangling algorithm works visually. It is open to the community in Github. Results. The performance of our approach for retrieving atmospheric stellar properties from spectra is demonstrated using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS) data from DR3. We use a data-driven perspective and obtain very competitive values, ali within the literature errors, and with the advantage of an important dimensionality reduction of the data to be processed.","['Minia Manteiga', 'Raúl Santoveña', 'Marco A.

A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension,"Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements, ranging from $4\sigma$ to $6\sigma$. In the current study we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the \emph{Pantheon}, \emph{PantheonPlus}, \emph{Joint Lightcurve Analysis} (JLA), and \emph{Dark Energy Survey} (DES) catalogs together with their combination called \emph{Master Sample} containing 3789 SNe Ia, and dividing all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Two main binning techniques are presented: the equipopulation and the equispace in the $\log\, z$. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. These $H_0$ values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: $\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$, where $\tilde{H}_0$ is a free parameter representing $\mathcal{H}_0(z)$ fitted at $z=0$, and $\alpha$ is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by $\alpha \sim 0.01$ whose consistency with zero range from $1.00 \sigma$ at 3 bins in the Pantheon sample with the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model to $\geq 6 \sigma$ at 12 bins with the JLA and DES samples within the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the SNe Ia astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases.

Direct N-body simulations of NGC 6397 and its tidal tails,"We have performed a series of direct N-body simulations that study the evolution of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 under the combined influence of two-body relaxation, stellar evolution and the Milky Way's tidal field. Our simulations follow the evolution of the cluster over the last several Gyr up to its present-day position in the Milky Way in order to allow us to derive present-day cluster parameters and the distribution of its extra-tidal stars. We have also determined a new density profile of NGC 6397 by selecting stars from Gaia DR3 using Gaia DR3 proper motions, parallaxes and photometry to discriminate cluster members from non-members. This allows us to derive the surface density profile of NGC 6397 and the location of its tidal tails up to 10 degrees of the cluster centre, well beyond the tidal radius of NGC 6397. Our results show that the current state of NGC 6397 in terms of surface density, velocity dispersion profile and stellar mass function can be matched by a cluster model evolving from a standard initial mass function and does not require an additional central cluster of dark remnants. We also find good agreement in the location and absolute number of the extra-tidal stars between our simulations and the observations, making it unlikely that NGC 6397 is surrounded by a dark matter halo.","['Anthony D.

Enhanced imaging of M87*: Simulations with the EHT and extended-KVN,"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has successfully revealed the shadow of the supermassive black hole, M87*, with an unprecedented angular resolution of approximately 20 uas at 230 GHz. However, because of limited short baseline lengths, the EHT has been constrained in its ability to recover larger scale jet structures. The extended Korean VLBI Network (eKVN) is committed to joining the EHT from 2024 that can improve short baseline coverage. This study evaluates the impact of the participation of eKVN in the EHT on the recovery of the M87* jet. Synthetic data, derived from a simulated M87* model, were observed using both the EHT and the combined EHT+eKVN arrays, followed by image reconstructions from both configurations. The results indicate that the inclusion of eKVN significantly improves the recovery of jet structures by reducing residual noise. Furthermore, jackknife tests, in which one or two EHT telescopes were omitted - simulating potential data loss due to poor weather - demonstrate that eKVN effectively compensates for these missing telescopes, particularly in short baseline coverage. Multi-frequency synthesis imaging at 86-230 GHz shows that the EHT+eKVN array enhances the recovered spectral index distribution compared to the EHT alone and improves image reconstruction at each frequency over single-frequency imaging. As the EHT continues to expand its array configuration and observing capabilities to probe black hole physics more in depth, the integration of eKVN into the EHT will significantly enhance the stability of observational results and improve image fidelity. This advancement will be particularly valuable for future regular monitoring observations, where consistent data quality is essential.","['Ilje Cho', 'Jongho Park', 'Do-Young Byun', 'Taehyun Jung', 'Lindy Blackburn', 'Freek Roelofs', 'Andrew Chael', 'Dominic W.

PyEMILI: A New Generation Computer-aided Spectral Line Identifier,"Deep high-dispersion spectroscopy of Galactic photoionized gaseous nebulae, mainly planetary nebulae and HII regions, has revealed numerous emission lines. As a key step of spectral analysis, identification of emission lines hitherto has mostly been done manually, which is a tedious task, given that each line needs to be carefully checked against huge volumes of atomic transition/spectroscopic database to reach a reliable assignment of identity. Using Python, we have developed a line-identification code PyEMILI, which is a significant improvement over the Fortran-based package EMILI introduced ~20 years ago. In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's line-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic transition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List v3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the literature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and NeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the atomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination lines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep, high-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better results of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the optical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the previous manual identifications. The new identifier PyEMILI is applicable to not only emission-line nebulae but also emission stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.","['Zhijun Tu', 'Xuan Fang', 'Robert Williams', 'Jifeng Liu']",2.0,34.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11845,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics']",ApJS,,"['Atomic physics (2063)', 'Spectral line identi- fication (2073)', 'Gaseous nebulae (639)', 'Astronomy software (1855) 1', 'H iiregions (694)', 'Spectroscopy (1558)', 'Planetary nebulae (1249)']",2025-01-22
Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds -- I: A Statistical Analysis of Velocity Structures,"We present a systematic analysis of the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of 167 molecular clouds with angular sizes greater than $\sim$176 arcmin$^2$ in three sectors of the Galactic mid-plane. We calculated the 1st- to 3rd-order VSFs and found that 60\% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The relative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent turbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law VSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in high-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly stronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing none power-law VSFs. Negative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not observed in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not correlate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two observations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still need further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular clouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of turbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are likely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show relatively large scatter. The fact that nearly 40\% of the VSFs deviate to some extent from power-law distributions suggests that the influence of local environments on the internal turbulence of molecular clouds may not be negligible.","['Yuehui Ma', 'Miaomiao Zhang', 'Hongchi Wang', 'Min Fang', 'Zhenyi Yue', 'Xuepeng Chen', 'Ji Yang', 'Fujun Du', 'Yang Su', 'Suziye He', 'Haoran Feng', 'Yan Sun', 'Chong Li', 'Qing-Zeng Yan', 'Zhiwei Chen', 'Shaobo Zhang', 'Xin Zhou']",14.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11859,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Star formation (1569)'],2025-01-22
"A multi-frequency census of 100 pulsars below 100 MHz with LWA: a systematic study of flux density, spectra, timing, dispersion, polarization, and its variation from a decade of observations","We present a census of 100 pulsars, the largest below 100 MHz, including 94 normal pulsars and six millisecond pulsars, with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88 MHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies and breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density, spectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements for 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency profile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for 27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the sources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands, with one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five recently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are especially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium. We have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc cm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over almost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows stringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above ~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual sources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations in B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from J0051+0423.","['Pratik Kumar', 'Greg B.

A White Dwarf Binary Candidate Discovered by LAMOST Using Dynamical Method,"We present the discovery of a binary system containing a white dwarf candidate using data from the LAMOST. Our analysis of the radial velocity data allowed us to determine an orbital period of approximately 0.953 days and a mass function of 0.129 $M_\odot$. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we obtained the stellar parameters of the visible star. By combining these results with the mass function, we established a relationship between the mass of the invisible star and the system's inclination angle, along with the Roche lobe radius. We find that the mass of the invisible star is below the Chandrasekhar limit when the inclination angle exceeds $35^\circ$. Given that systems with large variations in radial velocity typically have high inclination angles, we classify the invisible star as a white dwarf candidate. The Roche lobe radius exceeds the physical radius of the visible star, indicating that no mass transfer occurs, which results in a weak ellipsoidal modulation effect. Additionally, we obtained light curves from the TESS, ASAS-SN, and CRTS surveys. The light curves also exhibit a periodicity of approximately 0.95 days, with ellipsoidal modulation only in the 2019 TESS observations. Coupled with the strong $\rm H_{\alpha}$ emission line observed in the LAMOST MRS spectrum, we infer that the surface of the visible star contains significant hot spots. This obscures the system's inherently weak ellipsoidal modulation, resulting in a manifestation of rotational variables. Furthermore, an analysis of the dynamical characteristics of this system indicates that it has a high inclination angle ($>60$ degrees) and its orbital properties are consistent with those of typical thin disk stars, supporting the hypothesis that the invisible object is a white dwarf.","['Haifan Zhu', 'Wei Wang', 'Xue Lib', 'Jia-jia Li', 'Pengfu Tian']",10.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11865,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics,,"['Radial velocity', 'white dwarf 1', 'binary stars']",2025-01-22
FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on Bayesian-stacking-based HI mass function estimation,"This study investigates the estimation of the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) using a Bayesian stacking approach with simulated data for the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) HI intensity mapping (HIIM) drift-scan surveys. Using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation, we construct HI sky cubes at redshift $z\sim0.1$ and the corresponding optical galaxy catalogs, simulating FAST observations under various survey strategies, including pilot, deep-field, and ultradeep-field surveys. The HIMF is measured for distinct galaxy populations -- classified by optical properties into red, blue, and bluer galaxies -- and injected with systematic effects such as observational noise and flux confusion caused by the FAST beam. The results show that Bayesian stacking significantly enhances HIMF measurements. For red and blue galaxies, the HIMF can be well constrained with pilot surveys, while deeper surveys are required for the bluer galaxy population. Our analysis also reveals that sample variance dominates over observational noise, emphasizing the importance of wide-field surveys to improve constraints. Furthermore, flux confusion shifts the HIMF toward higher masses, which we address using a transfer function for correction. Finally, we explore the effects of intrinsic sample incompleteness and propose a framework to quantify its impact. This work lays the groundwork for future \hiMF studies with FAST HIIM, addressing key challenges and enabling robust analyses of HI content across galaxy populations.","['Jiaxin Wang', 'Yichao Li', 'Hengxing Pan', 'Furen Deng', 'Diyang Liu', 'Wenxiu Yang', 'Wenkai Hu', 'Yougang Wang', 'Xin Zhang', 'Xuelei Chen']",7.0,14.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11872,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Large-scale structure of the universe (902) — Galaxy evolution (594) — Extragalactic astronomy (506) — Surveys (1671) — Bayesian statistics (1900) 1'],2025-01-22
Metallicity Scatter Originating from Sub-kiloparsec Starbursting Clumps in the Core of a Protocluster at z=7.88,"We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at $z=7.88$, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at $z_{\rm spec}=7.8762$. One of the detected \oiii-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of $\log$(O/H)$+12=7.4\pm0.2$, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity ($\Delta \log {\rm (O/H)}\sim1$), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass $\log M_*/M_\odot\sim7.6$--8.9. Four of them are unresolved ($< 100$pc) and intensely star-forming ($>30 M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}}$), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor $\delta=44_{-31}^{+89}$, total halo mass $M_{\rm h} = 5.8_{-0.3}^{+0.2}\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$, and a formal velocity dispersion of $1100\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$.","['Takahiro Morishita', 'Massimo Stiavelli', 'Eros Vanzella', 'Pietro Bergamini', 'Kristan Boyett', 'Marco Chiaberge', 'Claudio Grillo', 'Nicha Leethochawalit', 'Matteo Messa', 'Guido Roberts-Borsani', 'Piero Rosati', 'Anowar Shajib']",7.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11879,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-22
Prospects for high-resolution probes of galaxy dynamics tracing background cosmology in MaNGA,"Large-$N$ galaxy surveys offer unprecedented opportunities to probe weak gravitation in galaxy dynamics that may contain correlations tracing background cosmology. Of particular interest is the potential of finite sensitivities to the background de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the velocity of light. At sufficiently large $N$, this is possibly probed by ensemble-averaged (""stacked"") rotation curves (RCs) at resolutions on par with present estimates of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. Here, we consider the prospect for studies using the large $N$ Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) at APO survey. In a first and preliminary step, we consider unbiased control of sub-sample size by consistency in the three Position Angles, $\theta$ , from photometry and velocity fields of gas and stars by spectroscopy within $30^\circ$. In sub-samples of size $N=N_i(\theta)$, the scatter in-the-mean $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ is found to reach one percent levels, differentiated over inclination angle $i$ and $\theta$. In regular propagation of uncertainties, this scatter contributes $\kappa\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ to the standard error in-the-mean to the observable, where $\kappa$ is determined by the choice of observables. As a lower bound to scatter in stacked RCs, MaNGA hereby appears promising for high-resolution analysis of sensitivity to RCs to background cosmology, notably across a sharp $C^0$-transition (van Putten 2018) of Newtonian to anomalous dynamics across $a_{dS}$ and, further out, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. In turn, these markers provide a novel measurement of cosmological parameters.","['Gyeong-Min Lee', 'Maurice H.P.M. van Putten']",4.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11882,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['Chandrasekhar Email address: mvp@sejong', 'white dwarfs', 'mass-radius relation']",2025-01-22
A Measurement of the Largest-Scale CMB E-mode Polarization with CLASS,"We present measurements of large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) E-mode polarization from the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) 90 GHz data. Using 115 det-yr of observations collected through 2024 with a variable-delay polarization modulator, we achieved a polarization sensitivity of $78\,\mathrm{\mu K\,arcmin}$, comparable to Planck at similar frequencies (100 and 143 GHz). The analysis demonstrates effective mitigation of systematic errors and addresses challenges to large-angular-scale power recovery posed by time-domain filtering in maximum-likelihood map-making. A novel implementation of the pixel-space transfer matrix is introduced, which enables efficient filtering simulations and bias correction in the power spectrum using the quadratic cross-spectrum estimator. Overall, we achieved an unbiased time-domain filtering correction to recover the largest angular scale polarization, with the only power deficit, arising from map-making non-linearity, being characterized as less than $3\%$. Through cross-correlation with Planck, we detected the cosmic reionization at $99.4\%$ significance and measured the reionization optical depth $\tau=0.053^{+0.018}_{-0.019}$, marking the first ground-based attempt at such a measurement. At intermediate angular scales ($\ell>30$), our results, both independently and in cross-correlation with Planck, remain fully consistent with Planck's measurements.","['Yunyang Li', 'Joseph Eimer', 'John Appel', 'Charles Bennett', 'Michael Brewer', 'Sarah Marie Bruno', 'Ricardo Bustos', 'Carol Chan', 'David Chuss', 'Joseph Cleary', 'Sumit Dahal', 'Rahul Datta', 'Jullianna Denes Couto', 'Kevin Denis', 'Rolando Dunner', 'Thomas Essinger-Hileman', 'Kathleen Harrington', 'Kyle Helson', 'Johannes Hubmayr', 'Jeffrey Iuliano', 'John Karakla', 'Tobias Marriage', 'Nathan Miller', 'Carolina Morales Perez', 'Lucas Parker', 'Matthew Petroff', 'Rodrigo Reeves', 'Karwan Rostem', 'Caleigh Ryan', 'Rui Shi', 'Koji Shukawa', 'Deniz Valle', 'Duncan Watts', 'J.

Considerations with stacking absorption spectra: cold HI gas in cirrus region of the Milky Way,"We use the Milky Way neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption and emission spectra from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (GASKAP) Phase II Pilot survey along with toy models to investigate the effects of stacking multicomponent spectra on measurements of peak optical depth and spin temperature. Shifting spectra by the peak in emission, 'primary' components shifted to 0 km s$^{-1}$ are correctly averaged. Additional components on individual sightlines are averaged with non-centred velocities, producing a broader and shallower 'secondary' component in the resulting stack. Peak optical depths and brightness temperatures of the secondary components from stacks are lower limits of their true average values due to the velocity offset of each component. The spin temperature however is well correlated with the truth since the velocity offset of components affects the emission and absorption spectra equally. Stacking 462 GASKAP absorption-emission spectral pairs, we detect a component with a spin temperature of 1320 $\pm$ 263 K, consistent with gas from the unstable neutral medium and higher than any previous GASKAP detection in this region. We also stack 2240 pilot survey spectra containing no Milky Way absorption, revealing a primary narrow and secondary broad component, with spin temperatures belonging to the cold neutral medium (CNM). Spatially binning and stacking the non-detections across the plane-of-sky by their distance from CNM absorption detections, the primary component's optical depth decreases with distance from known locations of cold gas. The spin temperature however remains stable in both components, over an approximate physical plane-of-sky distance of $\sim$ 100 pc.","['Callum Lynn', 'Antoine Marchal', 'N. M.

"The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE). V. Complete observations, data reduction and analysis, detection performances, and final results","During the past decade, state-of-the-art planet-finder instruments like SPHERE@VLT, coupling coronagraphic devices and extreme adaptive optics systems, unveiled, thanks to large surveys, around 20 planetary mass companions at semi-major axis greater than 10 astronomical units. Direct imaging being the only detection technique to be able to probe this outer region of planetary systems, the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE) was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2021 to study the demographics of such young gas giant planets around 400 young nearby solar-type stars. In this paper, we present the observing strategy, the data quality, and the point sources analysis of the full SHINE statistical sample as well as snapSHINE. Both surveys used the SPHERE@VLT instrument with the IRDIS dual band imager in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph IFS and the angular differential imaging observing technique. All SHINE data (650 datasets), corresponding to 400 stars, including the targets of the F150 survey, are processed in a uniform manner with an advanced post-processing algorithm called PACO ASDI. An emphasis is put on the classification and identification of the most promising candidate companions. Compared to the previous early analysis SHINE F150, the use of advanced post-processing techniques significantly improved by one or 2 magnitudes (x3-x6) the contrast detection limits, which will allow us to put even tighter constraints on the radial distribution of young gas giants. This increased sensitivity directly places SHINE as the largest and deepest direct imaging survey ever conducted. We detected and classified more than 3500 physical sources. One additional substellar companion has been confirmed during the second phase of the survey (HIP 74865 B), and several new promising candidate companions are awaiting second epoch confirmations.","['A.

The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer,"Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon ($z\approx2$). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has so far not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation. Methods. We apply the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors are then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass ($M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by $\approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}$. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below $\sim1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.","['Andrea Gebek', 'Benedikt Diemer', 'Marco Martorano', 'Arjen van der Wel', 'Lara Pantoni', 'Maarten Baes', 'Austen Gabrielpillai', 'Anand Utsav Kapoor', 'Calvin Osinga', 'Angelos Nersesian', 'Kosei Matsumoto', 'Karl Gordon']",12.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12008,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['extinction – radiative transfer 1', 'methods: numerical – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: photometry – ISM: dust']",2025-01-22
Synthetic Modelling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-Mass YSOs: II: Effects of Radiative Torque Disruption on Dust Grains in Protostellar Jets/Outflows,"One of the potential explanations for the existence of very large grains (VLGs) in the inner envelope of low/intermediate-mass Class 0/I Young Stellar Object is the migration of VLGs from the protostellar disk via a protostellar outflow. To understand whether the grain migration is prevented by RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), we perform the numerical modeling of RATD in parallel with the grain propagation, using the gas velocity and density structure inside the jet and outflow from an MHD simulation of an intermediate Class 0 protostar. We found that with the bolometric luminosity $\geq 20L_{\odot}$, RATD can destroy aggregate grains of size $1 \sim 500\rm \mu m$ having maximum tensile strength $S_{\rm max} \leq 10^{5} \rm erg cm^{-3}$ inside the jet/outflow base after $< 2$ yrs. This effect lets sub-micron grains dominate the outflow and partially prevent the migration of large grains from the inner disk to inner envelope. In contrast, RATD cannot prevent the migration of composite VLGs and submillimeter grains having $S_{\rm max}\geq 10^{7} \rm erg cm^{-3}$. Next, we incorporate RATD into POLARIS, assuming grains are not moving relative to the gas. We found that POLARIS works well in describing the disruption for aggregate grains, but overestimates the disruption efficiency for composite grains. The observed polarization degree can be reduced by twice when aggregate grains are removed from the outflow cavity wall and inner envelope by RATD. However, RATD is not an important factor controlling dust polarization properties as iron inclusions do.","['Nguyen Chau Giang', 'V. J. M. Le Gouellec', 'Thiem Hoang', 'A. J. Maury', 'P.

Unraveling the Nature of HAWC J1844-034 with Fermi-LAT Data Analysis and Multi-wavelength modelling,"The extended ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source HAWC J1844-034 is closely associated with two other sources, HAWC J1843-032 and HWC J1846-025. Moreover, other gamma-ray observatories like H.E.S.S., LHAASO, and Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ have detected ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources whose spatial positions coincide with the position of HAWC J1844-034. The ultra-high-energy gamma-ray data from several observatories help analyse the spectral features of this source in detail at TeV energies. Of the four pulsars near HAWC J1844-034, PSR J1844-0346 is closest to it and possibly supplies the cosmic-ray leptons to power this source. We have analysed the Fermi-LAT data to explore this source's morphology and identify its spectral feature in the Fermi-LAT energy band. After removing the contribution of the pulsar to the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution by pulsar phased analysis, we have obtained upper limits on the photon flux and identified the GeV counterpart PS J1844.2-0342 in the Fermi-LAT energy band with more than 5$\sigma$ significance, which may be a pulsar wind nebula. Finally, the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution has been modelled, assuming HAWC J1844-034 is a pulsar wind nebula.","['Sovan Boxi', 'Saptarshi Ghosh', 'Nayantara Gupta']",5.0,12.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12065,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['High-energy astrophysics(739) – Gamma rays (637) – Pulsar wind nebulae (2215) 1'],2025-01-22
Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies,"We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,M_\odot$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,{\rm Myr}$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.","['Mark Gieles', 'Paolo Padoan', 'Corinne Charbonnel', 'Jorick S.

"X-ray emission from isolated neutron stars: latest results from XMM-Newton, NICER and eROSITA","The X-ray spectra of isolated neutron stars (INSs) typically include a thermal component, that comes from the cooling surface, and a non-thermal component, produced by highly-relativistic particles accelerated in the stellar magnetosphere. Hot spots from returning currents can also be detected.Middle-aged pulsars exhibit a mixture of these components, but other flavours of INSs, that show a large variety of physical parameters (such as spin period, magnetic field and age) emit only thermal X-rays. Typically, these stars are detected either in large serendipitous datasets from pointed X-ray observations or from searches in the data of all-sky surveys.The connection between these thermally-emitting INSs, the ordinary pulsars, and the new emergent class of pulsars characterized by a long period, that do not show X-ray emission despite their high magnetic field, is one of the current challenges in the study of neutron stars.In this contribution I will review the latest results on several objects belonging to various INS classes, such as the XDINS RX J1308.6+2127, the enigmatic Calvera, the long period PSR J0250+5854 and the new thermal INS candidates, obtained with the X-ray observatories XMM-Newton, NICER and eROSITA.",['Michela Rigoselli'],5.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12143,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,appear in the Proceedings of the 17th Marcel Grossmann Meeting (MG17)/Pescara,,[],2025-01-22
Investigating launching of black hole jets with the combined power of the EVN and the EHT,"AGN-launched jets are a crucial element in the study of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their closest surroundings. The formation of such jets, whether they are launched by magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion disc or directly connected to the black hole's (BH) ergosphere, is the subject of ongoing, extensive research. 3C84, the compact radio source in the central galaxy NGC1275 of the Perseus super-cluster, is a prime laboratory for testing such jet launching scenarios, as well as studying the innermost, sub-parsec AGN structure and jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a unique view into the physical processes in action, in the immediate vicinity of BHs, unparalleled by other observational techniques. With VLBI at short wavelengths particular high angular resolutions are obtained. Utilising such cm and mm-VLBI observations of 3C84 with the European VLBI Network and the Event Horizon Telescope, we study the magnetic field strength and associated accretion flow around its central SMBH. This is possible, as higher frequency VLBI measurements are capable of peering through the accretion flow surrounding the central engine of 3C84, which is known to block the line of sight to the sub-parsec counter-jet via free-free absorption. Furthermore, we study the magnetic field's signature in the core region, as manifested in polarised light. As part of this analysis we compare our observations to relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we investigate the effect of instabilities on the shape of the jet's parsec-scale funnel and try to connect them to its historical evolution.","['G. F. Paraschos', 'L. C. Debbrecht', 'J. A.

"Modelling polarized X-ray pulses from accreting millisecond pulsars with X-PSI, using different surface patterns","We present an analysis of polarized X-ray pulses based on simulated data for accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs). We used the open-source X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference code (previously applied to NICER observations), that we upgraded to allow polarization analysis. We predicted neutron star parameter constraints for the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and found that strong limits on the hot region geometries can be hard to obtain if the emitting hot region is large and the number of polarized photons relatively small. However, if the star is bright enough and the hot regions are small and located so that polarization degree is higher, the observer inclination and hotspot colatitude can be constrained to a precision of within a few degrees. We also found that the shape of the hot region, whether a circle or a ring, cannot be distinguished in our most optimistic scenario. Nevertheless, future X-ray polarization missions are expected to improve the constraints, and already the recent AMP polarization detections by IXPE should help to infer the neutron star mass and radius when combined with modelling of X-ray pulse data sets that do not contain polarization information.","['Tuomo Salmi', 'Bas Dorsman', 'Anna L.

The Structure of the Molecular Envelope of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720),"We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO $J=2\rightarrow 1$ emission. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) mapping data, with $\sim$3$''$ spatial resolution and 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H$_2$ and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the $^{12}$CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is $\sim$6000 yr. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of $\pm$45--50 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event $\sim$6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.","['Joel H.

Cold gas bubble inflated by a low-luminosity radio jet,"We present NOEMA CO(2-1) observations of a nearby, young, low-luminosity radio source, B2 0258+35. Our earlier CO(1-0) study had shown the presence of strong jet-ISM interaction and a massive molecular gas outflow involving 75$\%$ of the circumnuclear gas. Our follow-up CO(2-1) observations have revealed even more complex gas kinematics, where the southern radio jet is driving out molecular gas in the form of a swiftly expanding bubble, with velocities up to almost 400 km s$^{-1}$. We found highly elevated CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratios for the gas belonging to the bubble and also further away from the radio jets. Previous observations have shown that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the host galaxy, NGC 1167, is in a very low-accretion state. Thus, we attribute the high line ratios to the high gas excitation caused by the jet--ISM interaction. The radio jets, despite exhibiting a relatively low luminosity ($1.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), are solely responsible for the observed extreme gas kinematics. This is one of the clearest detections of an expanding cold gas bubble in such a type of source, showing that the jets are affecting both the kinematics and physicals conditions of the gas. Our study adds to the growing store of evidence that low-luminosity radio sources can also affect the kinematics and physical conditions of the cold gas, which fuels star formation, in their host galaxies to a significant extent. Hence, such sources should be considered in models seeking to quantify feedback from radio AGN.","['Suma Murthy', 'Raffaella Morganti', 'Tom Oosterloo', 'Dipanjan Mukherjee', 'Suude Bayram', 'Pierre Guillard', 'Alexander Y.

Detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from Eta Carinae during its 2020 periastron passage,"The colliding-wind binary system $\eta$ Carinae has been identified as a source of high-energy (HE, below $\sim$100\,GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, above $\sim$100\,GeV) gamma rays in the last decade, making it unique among these systems. With its eccentric 5.5-year-long orbit, the periastron passage, during which the stars are separated by only $1-2$\,au, is an intriguing time interval to probe particle acceleration processes within the system. In this work, we report on an extensive VHE observation campaign that for the first time covers the full periastron passage carried out with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in its 5-telescope configuration with upgraded cameras. VHE gamma-ray emission from $\eta$ Carinae was detected during the periastron passage with a steep spectrum with spectral index $\Gamma= 3.3 \pm 0.2_{\mathrm{stat}} \, \pm 0.1_{\mathrm{syst}}$. Together with previous and follow-up observations, we derive a long-term light curve sampling one full orbit, showing hints of an increase of the VHE flux towards periastron, but no hint of variability during the passage itself. An analysis of contemporaneous Fermi-LAT data shows that the VHE spectrum represents a smooth continuation of the HE spectrum. From modelling the combined spectrum we conclude that the gamma-ray emission region is located at distances of ${\sim}10 - 20$\,au from the centre of mass of the system and that protons are accelerated up to energies of at least several TeV inside the system in this phase.","['H.E.S.S.

Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction,"Recently, the worldwide Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations detected a stochastic gravitational wave(GW) background in the nanohertz range, which may originate from the early universe's inflationary phase. So in this work, we investigated induce GWs in the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet coupling. Consider the scenario of traversing a domain wall in moduli space, we take the coupling coefficient to be an approximately step function. Within suitable parameter regions, the model exhibits de Sitter fixed points, which allows inflation to undergo an ultra-slow-roll phase, which causes the power spectrum to exhibit a peak. Such a peak can induce nanohertz GWs, which provids an explanation for the PTA observational data. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple domain wall crossings, and adopting a double-step coupling function. In this case, the resulting GW spectrum has two peaks with frequencies around \(10^{-8} \,\text{Hz}\) and \(10^{-2}\,\text{Hz}\), respectively. Which can be observed by the PTA and the space GW detectorsthis http URL, the reentry of the power spectrum peaks into the horizon leads to the collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We calculate the abundance of PBHs and found that the masses is in the range of \(10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13} M_\odot\) and around \(10^{-2} M_\odot\) , which constitute significant components of the current dark matter.","['Peng-Bo Chen', 'Tie-Jun Gao']",3.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12242,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-22
"Orbital Stability of Hierarchical 3 and 4-Body Systems with Inclination: Results for Kepler-1625, 1708, and HD 23079","As the number of potential exomoon candidates grows, there is a heightened motivation of pursing orbital stability analyses. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation into 4-body systems, consisting of a star, planet, moon, and submoon by using the N-body simulator rebound. Particularly, we focus on the system of Kepler-1625, where evidence of a possible exomoon has been obtained. We investigate the 3-body star--planet--moon system for the proposed exomoon parameters allowing us to identify stable regions associated with most of the space parameters. Thereafter, we consider a 4-body system including a potential submoon. We find that there are both stable and unstable regions, as expected, as well as resonance patterns that are further explored using numerical and analytical methods including secular perturbation theory. We are able to identify these resonances as secular in nature. In addition, we investigate 3-body versions of two other systems, Kepler-1708 and HD 23079, while also studying a 4-body version of HD 23079.

On the nature of buckling instability in galactic bars,"Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which manifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane which later dissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy I demonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the first one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the pattern speed of the bar so that the distortion remains stationary in the reference frame of the bar. The growth can be described simply with the mechanism of a driven harmonic oscillator which decreases the vertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase most bar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with resonant vertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes of vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal oscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the harmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal frequencies. In the following, second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of the distortion increases reaching one third of the circular frequency, but decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave and winds up leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased horizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of banana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar where the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly suggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose instability but can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical resonance creating the distortion that later winds up.",['Ewa L.

We include in our study classical novae variables, nova-like variables (including the VY Scl and UX UMa subclasses), and recurrent novae variable stars.

Tracing magnetic switchbacks to their source: An assessment of solar coronal jets as switchback precursors,"The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.","['Nina Bizien', 'Clara Froment', 'Maria S.

Five galaxies demonstrate double sequences with the $\alpha$-enriched one being older and kinematically hotter, in qualitative agreement with the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ populations in the Milky Way disk; three galaxies have unimodal distribution, two show weakly-bimodal features where low-$\alpha$ sequence is visible only over a short range of metallicities, and one show strong bimodality with a different slope of high-$\alpha$ population. We examine the galaxies' gas accretion history over the last 8 Gyr, when bimodal sequences emerge, and demonstrate that the presence of the low-$\alpha$ sequence in the bimodal galaxies is related to the recent infall of metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium that joins the galaxy in the outskirts and induces significant growth of the gas disks compared to their non-bimodal counterparts. We also analyse the sources of the accreted gas and illustrate that both gas-rich mergers and smooth accretion of ambient gas can be the source of the accreted gas, and create slightly different bimodal patterns.","['Hanna Parul', 'Jeremy Bailin', 'Sarah R.

The doubly librating Plutinos,"Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about the 3/2 ratio with Neptune's. We investigate the long term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, $g$, a well-known characteristic of Pluto's orbit. We show that the $g$ librators amongst the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity--inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincaré at the end of the 19th century. Approximately sixteen percent of the currently known Plutinos exhibit $g$ librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.","['Renu Malhotra', 'Takashi Ito']",10.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12345,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,ApJ,,['Plutinos(1266) — Resonant Kuiper belt objects(1396) — Kuiper belt(893) — Orbital res- onances(1181) 1'],2025-01-22
Accelerating Pulsar Parameter Estimation Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Accurate models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, realistic models incorporating magnetic fields structures are exceedingly computationally intensive. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field (SVF) model, the NN provides a >400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium, which is infeasible to obtain with the original physical model alone. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model and evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing for greater speedups compared to physical models that are more complex than the SVF model.","['Greg Olmschenk', 'Emily Broadbent', 'Constantinos Kalapotharakos', 'Wendy Wallace', 'Thibault Lechien', 'Zorawar Wadiasingh', 'Demosthenes Kazanas', 'Alice Harding']",6.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12383,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,"Astronomy Education Journal 4, 1 (2024)",[],2025-01-22
Ripples spreading across the Galactic disc: Interplay of direct and indirect effects of the Sagittarius dwarf impact,"Gaia data have revealed vertically asymmetric phase-space structures in the Milky Way (MW) disc, such as phase spirals, indicating vertical oscillations. These oscillations exhibit two distinct modes: the bending mode and the breathing mode, associated with one-arm and two-arm phase spirals, respectively. This study aims to explore the excitation mechanisms of the bending and breathing modes and their subsequent evolution in the MW disc, focusing on the interplay between direct perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and indirect contributions from tidally induced spiral arms. We perform high-resolution $N$-body simulations to model the interaction between an MW-like disc galaxy and a Sagittarius dwarf-like satellite. These simulations resolve fine phase-space structures, enabling analysis of the bending and breathing modes at both macroscopic (global bending and breathing waves) and microscopic (local phase spirals) scales. Our simulations demonstrate that the satellite's perturbation directly excites the bending mode and induces spiral arms in the galactic disc. These spiral arms excite the breathing mode, making it an indirect consequence of the satellite interaction. Initially, the bending mode dominates, but it rapidly decays due to horizontal mixing. In contrast, the breathing mode persists for a longer duration, sustained by the spiral arms, leading to a transition from a bending-dominated to a breathing-dominated state. This transition progresses faster in the inner galaxy than in the outer regions. The simulations reproduce the one-arm phase spiral observed in the solar neighbourhood and reveal two-arm phase spirals, particularly in the inner galaxy, associated with spiral arm-induced breathing modes. Our findings highlight the combined effects of direct satellite perturbations and indirect spiral arm dynamics in shaping the vertical structure of the MW disc.","['Tetsuro Asano', 'Michiko S.

Introducing the AIDA-TNG project: galaxy formation in alternative dark matter models,"We introduce the AIDA-TNG project, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously model galaxy formation and different variations of the underlying dark matter model. We consider the standard cold dark matter model and five variations, including three warm dark matter scenarios and two self-interacting models with constant or velocity-dependent cross-section. In each model, we simulate two cosmological boxes of 51.7 and 110.7 Mpc on a side, with the same initial conditions as TNG50 and TNG100, and combine the variations in the physics of dark matter with the fiducial IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. The AIDA-TNG runs are thus ideal for studying the simultaneous effect of baryons and alternative dark matter models on observable properties of galaxies and large-scale structures. We resolve haloes in the range between $10^{8}$ and $4\times10^{14}\,$M$_{\odot}$ and scales down to the nominal resolution of 570 pc in the highest resolution runs. This work presents the first results on statistical quantities such as the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum; we quantify the modification in the number of haloes and the power on scales smaller than 1 Mpc, due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter physics. Despite being calibrated on cold dark matter, we find that the TNG galaxy formation model can produce a realistic galaxy population in all scenarios. The stellar and gas mass fraction, stellar mass function, black hole mass as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate density are very similar in all dark matter models, with some deviations only in the most extreme warm dark matter model. Finally, we also quantify changes in halo structure due to warm and self-interacting dark matter, which appear in the density profiles, concentration-mass relation and galaxy sizes.","['Giulia Despali', 'Lauro Moscardini', 'Dylan Nelson', 'Annalisa Pillepich', 'Volker Springel', 'Mark Vogelsberger']",18.0,20.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12439,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Cosmology: dark matter – Cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe – Galaxies – Galaxies: evolution 1'],2025-01-23
The AGN Optical Variability Fundamental Plane,"We investigate the relationship between AGN optical variability timescales, amplitudes, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses using homogeneous light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We fit a damped random walk (DRW) model to high-cadence, long-baseline ASAS-SN light curves to estimate the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_\text{DRW}$) and amplitude ($\sigma$) for 57 AGN with precise SMBH mass measurements from reverberation mapping and dynamical methods. We confirm a significant correlation between $\tau_\text{DRW}$ and SMBH mass, and find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (1.85\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200 \text{ days})+7.59\pm0.08$. Incorporating $\hat{\sigma}^2 = 2\sigma^2/\tau_\text{DRW}$ in a plane model significantly improves residuals, and we find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (2.27\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200\text{ days})+(1.20\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10}(\hat{\sigma}/\text{1 mJy/days}^{1/2})+7.68\pm0.08$ with a scatter of 0.39 dex. We calculate $\tau_\text{DRW}$, $\hat{\sigma}$, and estimate SMBH masses for 203 bright ($V<16$ mag) AGN from the Milliquas catalog and compare these estimates with measurements from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey for 42 overlapping AGN. In 10 years, LSST could extend this method to survey $7\lesssim\text{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim9$ SMBHs out to $z\sim1$ and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim8.0$ out to $z\sim4$, and ASAS-SN could probe $5\lesssim \textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ SMBHs in the local universe and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim9.0$ out to $z\sim2$.

"Survey of Radiative, Two-Temperature Magnetically Arrested Simulations of the Black Hole M87* I: Turbulent Electron Heating","We present a set of eleven two-temperature, radiative, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (2TGRRMHD) simulations of the black hole M87* in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state, surveying different values of the black hole spin $a_*$. Our 3D simulations self-consistently evolve the temperatures of separate electron and ion populations under the effects of adiabatic compression/expansion, viscous heating, Coulomb coupling, and synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton radiation. We adopt the Kawazura+ 2019 sub-grid heating prescription from gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. Our simulations have accretion rates $\dot{M}=(0.5-1.5)\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and radiative efficiencies $\epsilon_{\rm rad}=2-14\%$. We compare our simulations to a fiducial set of otherwise identical single-fluid GRMHD simulations and find no significant changes in the outflow efficiency or black hole spindown parameter. Our simulations produce an effective adiabatic index for the two-temperature plasma of $\Gamma_{\rm gas}\approx1.55$, larger than the $\Gamma_{\rm gas}=13/9$ value often adopted in single-fluid GRMHD simulations. We find moderate ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the 230 GHz emitting region of $R=T_{\rm i}/T_{\rm e}{\approx}5$. While total intensity 230 GHz images from our simulations are consistent with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results, our images have significantly more beam-scale linear polarization ($\langle|m|\rangle\approx 30\%$) than is observed in EHT images of M87* ($\langle|m|\rangle<10\%$). We find a trend of the average linear polarization pitch angle $\angle\beta_2$ with black hole spin consistent with what is seen in single-fluid GRMHD simulations, and we provide a simple fitting function for $\angle\beta_2(a_*)$ motivated by the wind-up of magnetic field lines by black hole spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.",['Andrew Chael'],12.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12448,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,MNRAS,,"['accretion discs – MHD – methods:numerical – galaxies:jets – galaxies:nuclei 1 INTRODUCTION Most supermassive black holes are surrounded by hot', 'low- luminosity plasma accretion flows (Greene & Ho 2007', 'black hole physics – accretion']",2025-01-23
Intervening nuclear obscuration changing the X-ray look of the $z\approx6$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520,"X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z>6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z>6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $>20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z>6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.","['Fabio Vito', 'William Nielsen Brandt', 'Andrea Comastri', 'Roberto Gilli', 'Franz Bauer', 'Silvia Belladitta', 'George Chartas', 'Kazushi Iwasawa', 'Giorgio Lanzuisi', 'Bin Luo', 'Stefano Marchesi', 'Marco Mignoli', 'Federica Ricci', 'Ohad Shemmer', 'Cristiana Spingola', 'Cristian Vignali', 'Walter Boschin', 'Felice Cusano', 'Diego Paris']",2.0,5.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12449,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['early universe - galaxies: active - galaxies: high-redshift - methods: observational - galaxies: individual (CFHQS J164121 +375520) - X-rays: individual (CFHQS J164121 +375520) 1'],2025-01-23
First photometric investigation of V517 Cam combined with ground-based and TESS data,"The observations of eclipsing binary systems are of great importance in astrophysics, as they allow direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters. By analysing high-quality space-based observations with ground-based photometric data, it becomes possible to detect these fundamental parameters with greater precision using multicolour photometry. Here, we report the first photometric analysis results of the V517 Cam eclipsing binary system by combining the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve and new CCD observations in BVRI filters, obtained with a 60 cm robotic telescope (T60) at the TÜBİTAK National Observatory. By means of photometric analyses, the masses and radii of the primary and secondary stars were carefully determined to be $M_{1}= 1.47\pm 0.06\,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 0.79\pm0.05\,M_\odot$, and $R_{1}=1.43\pm 0.03\,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 0.75\pm 0.04\,R_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, the distance to V517 Cam was calculated to be $284\pm20$ pc. The overall age of the system is estimated to be around $63\pm15$ Myr. At this age, the primary component stands near the onset of its main-sequence evolution, near the ZAMS, whereas the secondary component remains in the pre-main-sequence evolutionary phase. To better understand the evolutionary status and nature of V517 Cam, the mass ratio and temperature values, obtained with relatively low sensitivity by photometric measurements, need to be confirmed by spectral analysis.","['N.

Search Capability for Near-Earth Objects with the Wide Field Survey Telescope,"Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with a powerful sky survey capability in the northern hemisphere, will play an important role in asteroid searching and monitoring. However, WFST is not a telescope dedicated to near-Earth asteroids (NEOs) searching. In order to improve the efficiency of finding NEOs on the premise of meeting the needs of other scientific research, we ran mock observations for WFST to study its search capability for NEOs. The NEO population model, the WFST detection model and site conditions are taken into account in our simulations. Based on the original scheduling scheme, we present two new schemes. Compared to the original scheme, the optimized scheme can improve the search capability of known and unknown NEOs by 100% and 50%. We also emphasized the importance of trailing loss and proposed an improved effective field of view model. In addition, it is predicted that adopting the clear-day ratio of 0.7 and the optimized scheme, for NEOs with absolute magnitude from 17 to 25, WFST can provide tracklets for about 1800 NEOs if their orbits are known, and in the case of blind search, more than 600 NEOs can be found by WFST. The new schemes provide valuable reference and suggestions for the WFST's regular survey strategy.","['Jun-Qiang Lu', 'Lu-Lu Fan', 'Min-Xuan Cai', 'Shao-Han Wang', 'Bing-Xue Fu', 'Xu Kong', 'Qing-Feng Zhu']",6.0,16.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12460,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],PASP,,['Near-Earth objects (1092) — Small Solar System bodies (1469) — Sky surveys (1464) — Asteroids (72) 1'],2025-01-23
Revisiting the fundamental parameters for the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1753.5-0127,"We present time-resolved Gran Telescopio Canarias optical spectroscopy and William Herschel Telescope $i$-band photometry of the X-ray transient SWIFT J1753.5-0127 in quiescence. The $i$-band light curve is dominated by flickering with an amplitude of $\sim 0.5$ mag and shows no evidence of the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion star. The telluric-corrected average spectrum, on the other hand, reveals the presence of weak (strongly veiled) TiO bands at $7055$ Ȧ and $7589$ Ȧ. We used them for a spectral classification, finding an M4-5 V companion star. However, as velocity shifts are not clearly detected in the individual spectra, we turned the analysis to the double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line from the accretion disc. By exploiting the empirical correlations established for quiescent X-ray transients between the line morphology and fundamental binary parameters, we estimated the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the companion $K_2 = 820 \pm 36$ km s$^{-1}$, a mass ratio $q = 0.023 \pm 0.006$ and an inclination $i = 79 \pm 5$ deg. Moreover, an orbital period of $3.26 \pm 0.02$ h was measured from the modulation of the centroid velocities and the double-peak trough depth of the H$\alpha$ profile. These quantities yielded a mass function $f(M_1) = 7.8 \pm 1.0$ M$_\odot$ and black hole and companion star masses of $M_1 = 8.8 \pm 1.3$ M$_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.20 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$, respectively. The companion star mass is in line with the spectral classification obtained from the relative depth of the TiO bands. Based on the mean quiescent magnitude ($i = 21.4 \pm 0.1$), orbital period, and interstellar extinction, we estimate the distance to the source to be $3.9 \pm 0.7$ kpc and a Galactic plane elevation of $0.8 \pm 0.2$ kpc, supporting the case for a large natal kick.","['I.V.

Near-infrared Integral-field Spectroscopy of the Wind Forming Region of CW Leo,"The circumstellar envelope of the carbon star CW Leo exhibited various unexpected changes in recent optical imaging observations. We have performed a follow-up observation using the Near-infrared Integral-Field Spectrograph (NIFS) equipped on the Gemini-North telescope. We report the near-infrared counterparts of a local brightness peak in the optical at the stellar position of CW Leo. On the other hand, a second peak detected at short wavelengths in the J band coincides with the brightest, bluest position in the optical images. The absorption features in the K band are minimized at a radius of 0.2 arcsec from the predicted stellar position. The reduction of the absorption depths likely indicates dilution of the absorption features by thermal emission of dust grains newly formed at such a radius and heated by radiation from the central star. The broad absorption feature at 1.53 um is significantly deeper than in template carbon stars, consistent with the presence of a substantial amount of circumstellar material around CW Leo. Its northeastern quadrant lacks circumstellar absorption features and scattered light in the near-infrared regime, which are possibly manifestations of its conical cavity in both gas and dust. In addition, a cross correlation of CO overtone bands indicates that the average expansion velocity of dust grains is smaller to the northern direction, likewise the velocity of transverse wind components derived using the differential proper motion of a circumstellar whirled pattern. The gradual brightening of CW Leo and the changes in its innermost circumstellar envelope need further continuous monitoring observations to properly understand its transitional phase toward the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage.","['Hyosun Kim', 'Youichi Ohyama', 'Ho-Gyu Lee', 'Ji Hoon Kim']",13.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12484,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,"AJ, 169, 69 (2025)",['Asymptotic giant branch stars (2100)'],2025-01-23
Constraining Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Eccentric Binary Mergers using Doppler Triangulation,"Strong lensing of gravitational wave (GW) sources allows the observer to see the GW source from different lines-of-sight (LOS) through the corresponding images, which provides a way for constraining the relative proper motion of the GW source. This is possible as the GW signals received from each image will have slightly different projected velocity components, from which one can `Doppler-Triangulate' for the GW source velocity vector. The difference in projected velocity between the different images can be observationally inferred through pairwise GW phase measurements that accumulate over the time-of-observation. In this paper we study lensed eccentric GW sources and explore how the observable GW phase shift between images evolve as a function of time, eccentricity, lens- and binary parameters. Next generation GW observatories, including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will see $\sim $hundreds/year of lensed GW sources, where a significant fraction of these are expected to be eccentric. We discuss the expected unique observables for such eccentric lensed GW sources, and the relation to their observable relative linear motion, which otherwise is exceedingly difficult to constrain in general.","['Johan Samsing', 'Lorenz Zwick', 'Pankaj Saini', 'Kai Hendriks', 'Rico K.

Multiband Embeddings of Light Curves,"In this work, we propose a novel ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that considers the multiband and non-uniform cadence without having to compute complex features. Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of RNNs, which do not require the entire light curve to perform inference, making the inference process simpler. The ensemble is able to adapt to varying numbers of bands, tested on three real light curve datasets, namely Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, and ZTF, to demonstrate its potential for generalization. We also show the capabilities of deep learning to perform not only classification, but also regression of physical parameters such as effective temperature and radius. Our ensemble model demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with fewer observations, thus providing potential for early classification of sources from facilities such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. The results underline the model's effectiveness and flexibility, making it a promising tool for future astronomical surveys. Our research has shown that a multitask learning approach can enrich the embeddings obtained by the models, making them instrumental to solve additional tasks, such as determining the orbital parameters of binary systems or estimating parameters for object types beyond periodic ones.","['I.

X-ray emission from helium star+black hole binaries as probes of tidally induced spin-up of second-born black holes,"Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (<\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

New TeV-emitting BL Lac candidates from the eROSITA X-ray survey,"TeV-emitting BL Lac type blazars represent the extreme end of the blazar population. They are characterized by relatively weak jets and radiatively inefficient accretion disks. Particles accelerated in these jets experience fewer radiative losses, allowing them to reach energies beyond the TeV scale and produce TeV gamma-ray emission. The study of TeV blazars is constrained by the limited number of known sources in this category. Currently, only 56 high synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs have been detected at energies above 0.1\,TeV. Searches for TeV emission from BL~Lacs typically target sources with bright X-ray emission and a synchrotron peak at or above 1\,keV. The recently released eRASS1 catalog by the eROSITA collaboration, which covers half of the sky, represents the deepest X-ray survey in the soft X-ray band to date. Utilizing the eROSITA survey, combined with infrared data from WISE and archival radio observations, we have identified 135 TeV-emitting blazar candidates. Our search introduces selection criteria based on the radio to infrared that remove quasar-like objects that have similar infrared spectra and X-ray fluxes as TeV-emitting BL~Lacs. In our search, we find 26 objects that had not been detected in the ROSAT X-ray survey and 20 that have not been previously associated with blazars. The candidates resulting from our search are suitable for follow-up observations with currently operating imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, as well as future facilities like the CTAO Observatory.","['Cassidy Metzger', 'Andrea Gokus', 'Manel Errando']",7.0,14.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12520,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Blazars'],2025-01-23
Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope,"Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.","['Elahe Khalouei', 'Arman Shafieloo', 'Alex G. Kim', 'Ryan E.

Two repeated quasi-periodic oscillations in the FSRQ S5 1044+71 observed by TESS,"In this work, we report for the first time two repeated quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curve of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) S5 1044+71. This source was observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in multiple sectors. We used the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram method and weighted wavelet Z-transform method to search for significant periodic signals. The main results are as follows: We found QPOs of $\sim$ 7.0 days (persisted for 4 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.5\sigma$) and $\sim$ 7.3 days (persisted for 5 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.8\sigma$) in the light curves of Sector 47 and EP1, respectively. Considering range of error, we consider them to be the same. We discussed two likely models of these rapid quasi-periodic variations: One comes from the jet and the other from the accretion disk. For the first one, we consider kink instability of the jet as a plausible explanation. Second, the QPO is probable to come from the main hot spots in the accretion disk, which is located approximately within the innermost stable circular orbit allowed by general relativity. Based on this model, we estimate the mass of the black hole in S5 1044+71 to be $3.49 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$.","['Jun-Jie Wang', 'Ting-Feng Yi', 'Yangwei Zhang', 'He Lu', 'Yuncai Shen', 'Lisheng Mao', 'Liang Dong']",4.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12556,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar — S5 1044+71 — Optical light curve — Black hole 1'],2025-01-23
Enhancing Fault Diagnosis in GWAC: A Monitoring System for Telescope Arrays,"The Ground-based Wide-Angle Cameras array (GWAC) necessitates the integration of over 100 hardware devices, more than 100 servers, and upwards of 2500 software modules, all synchronized within a 3-second imaging cycle. However, the complexity of real-time and high concurrency processing of big data have historically resulted in a substantial failure rate, with estimated observation efficiency of less than 50% in 2023. To address these challenges, we developed a monitoring system aimed at enhancing fault diagnosis efficiency. This paper details the system's architecture, data collection methods, and the design philosophy of monitoring views. After a year of practical fault diagnostics, the system has demonstrated the ability to identify and localize faults within minutes, achieving fault localization speeds nearly ten times faster than traditional methods. Additionally, the system's design exhibits high generalizability, making them applicable to other telescope array systems.","['Y. Xu', 'G. W. Li', 'J. Wang', 'L. P. Xin', 'H. B. Cai', 'X. H.

Exploring quasar evolution with proximate molecular absorbers: Insights from the kinematics of highly ionized nitrogen,"We investigate the presence and kinematics of NV absorption proximate to high redshift quasars selected upon the presence of strong $H_{2}$ and HI absorption at the quasar redshift. Our spectroscopic observations with X-shooter at the VLT reveal a 70% detection rate of NV (9 of 13 quasars with 2.5 < z < 3.3), remarkably higher than the 10% detection rate in intervening DLA systems and the 30% rate observed within a few thousand km/s of the source in the general quasar population. While many NV components lie within the velocity range of the neutral gas, the kinematic profiles of high-ionization species appear decoupled from those of low-ionization species, with the former extending over much larger velocity ranges, particularly towards bluer velocities. We also observe significant variations in the NV/SiIV, which we attribute to varying ionization conditions, with a velocity-dependent trend: blueshifted NV components systematically exhibit higher ionization parameters compared to those near the quasar's systemic redshift. Furthermore, the most redshifted systems relative to the quasar show no evidence of NV absorption. The results suggest that proximate $H_{2}$ absorption systems select critical stages of quasar evolution, during which the quasar remains embedded in a rich molecular environment. Redshifted systems trace infalling gas, potentially associated with mergers, preceding the onset of outflows. Such outflows may reach or even carry out neutral and molecularthis http URLlatter stage would correspond to proximate $H_{2}$ systems located around or blueshifted relative to the quasar's systemic z. Finally, the only case in our sample featuring highly blueshifted neutral gas shows no evidence of an association with thethis http URLfindings highlight the need to account for the ionization state when defining a velocity threshold to distinguish quasar-associated systems from intervening.","['R.

Study of the IC 443 region with the HAWC observatory,"Context. Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. We study this region using very-high-energy gamma-ray data.Aims. We explore the region of IC 443 using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory. We study the emission of this supernova remnant and search for signatures that would show acceleration of (hadronic) cosmic rays at the PeV range.Methods. We use the maximum likelihood estimation and a likelihood ratio test to perform a multi-source fitting search. We find the best-fit morphology and spectrum of the IC 443 region above $\sim$300 GeV that best describes the HAWC data.Results. We observe a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of -3.14$\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. We also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of -2.49$\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213.Conclusions. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we find a new extended source in the region. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.","['R. Alfaro', 'C. Alvarez', 'M. Araya', 'J.C.

Electric field reconstruction with three polarizations for the radio detection of ultra-high energy particles,"The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field directly at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of an electric field and better than 6\% accuracy, with minimal bias, when estimating energy fluence. Additionally, this method is reliable for almost all arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.","['Kewen Zhang', 'Tim Huege', 'Ramesh Koirala', 'Pengxiong Ma', 'Matías Tueros', 'Xin Xu', 'Chao Zhang', 'Pengfei Zhang', 'Yi Zhang']",18.0,30.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12614,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,"['Radio detection', 'Cosmic rays', 'Electric field reconstruction ArXiv ePrint: 1234']",2025-01-23
"DarkAI: Reconstructing the density, velocity and tidal field of dark matter from DESI-like bright galaxy sample","Reconstructing the dark matter density, velocity, and tidal (MTV) fields from galaxy surveys is essential for advancing our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k < 0.1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of the grid-to-grid relationship close to unity and a scatter below $\sim$100 $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.","['Feng Shi', 'Zitong Wang', 'Xiaohu Yang', 'Yizhou Gu', 'Chengliang Wei', 'Ming Li', 'Jiaxin Han', 'Huiyuan Wang', 'Youcai Zhang', 'Wensheng Hong', 'Yirong Wang', 'Xiao-dong Li']",15.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12621,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Large-scale structure of the universe(902) — Dark matter distribution(356) — Redshift surveys(1378)—Convolutional neural networks(1938) 1'],2025-01-23
Forecasting of the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons in the AMS-02 era,"The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.","['Cheng-Rui Zhu', 'Kai-Kai Duan']",10.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12625,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-23
A semi-analytic model for decaying dark matter halos,"Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.","['Ethan O.

Resonance Capture and Stability Analysis for Planet Pairs under Type I Disk Migration,"We present a theoretical model to investigate a two-planet pair that undergoes convergent type I migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk and traps into the first-order mean motion resonance. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and explores the subsequent dynamical stability of the system. We derive the analytical criteria for planets with an arbitrary mass ratio and validate through numerical N-body simulations. Slow migration and weak eccentricity damping are required for resonant capture, the latter of which has not received enough attention in the literature. Once capture into resonance, their following stability can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Notably, resonant capture remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. However, the subsequent evolution can be diverse when the mass of the inner planet is lower or comparable to that of the outer planet. Stability weakens as the relative strength between migration and eccentricity damping increases. The key results can be comprehensively demonstrated in a $\tau_{a}$-$\tau_{a}/\tau_{\rm e}$ plot, where $\tau_{a}$ and $\tau_{\rm e}$ are orbital decay and eccentricity damping timescales, respectively.","['Linghong Lin', 'Beibei Liu', 'Zekai Zheng']",11.0,13.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12650,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability – celestial mechanics – methods: analytical 1'],2025-01-23
Formation of massive star clusters with and without iron abundance spreads in a dwarf galaxy merger,"To study the formation of star clusters and their properties in a dwarf-dwarf merging galaxy, we have performed a numerical simulation of a dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger by using the Tree+GRAPE $N$-body/SPH code ASURA. In our simulation, 13 young star clusters are formed during the merger process. We show that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and without [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star cluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars contaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the energy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas. After that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new generation of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star clusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter and fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several hundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters take place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are tidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge at the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster. Therefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components in [Fe/H] abundance and age. We discuss our work in the context of observations and demonstrate the diagnostic power of high-resolution simulations in the context of star cluster formation.","['Hidenori Matsui', 'Kenji Bekki', 'Madeleine McKenzie', 'Takayuki R.

On the equivalence between galaxy angular correlation function and power spectrum in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity,"We investigate the angular power spectrum ($C_\ell)$ and angular correlation function ($w(\theta)$) of galaxy number density field in the presence of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), explicitly accounting for the integral constraint in an all-sky survey. We show that the PNG signature in $C_{\ell}$ is confined to low multipoles in the linear regime, whereas its signature in $w(\theta)$ extends across a wide range of angular scales, including those below the nonlinear scale. Therefore, the equivalence between $C_\ell$ and $w(\theta)$ can be violated when scale cuts of multipoles or angular scales -- for example, to mitigate systematic effects -- are applied in the analysis. Assuming samples of photometric galaxies divided into multiple redshift bins in the range $0<z<7$, we forecast the precision of constraining the PNG parameter ($f_{\rm NL}$) from the hypothetical measurements of $C_\ell$ or $w(\theta)$ assuming different scale cuts in the multipoles or angular scales, respectively. Our results imply that the PNG information can be extracted from $w(\theta)$ on relatively small angular scales such as $\lesssim 10$ degree for a high-redshift galaxy sample or from $w(\theta)$ measured in a survey with partial area coverage.","['Ryo Terasawa', 'Yue Nan', 'Masahiro Takada']",4.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12661,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-23
A Pilot Study for the CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Quasar Survey Based on Mock Data,"The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 $\text{deg}^2$. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover a wavelength range from 2550 to 10000Å at a resolution of $R\sim 200$ and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with the r-band magnitudes of $18<\text{m}_{\text{r}}<22$ using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code. Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying the strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate the black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts $z=0-5$ from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99\%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90\% of them could have precise redshift measurements with $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}=0.002$. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1-0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to AGN science and cosmology.","['Yuxuan Pang', 'Xue-Bing Wu', 'Yuming Fu', 'Rui Zhu', 'Bing Lyu', 'Huimei Wang', 'Xiaotong Feng']",15.0,19.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12665,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Active galactic nuclei (16) — Galactic and extragalactic astronomy (563) — Quasars (1319) — Spectroscopy(1558) — Supermassive black holes (1663) 1'],2025-01-23
A detailed study on spectroscopic performance of SOI pixel detector with a pinned depleted diode structure for X-ray astronomy,"We have been developing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detectors with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure, named ""XRPIX"", for X-ray astronomy. In our previous study, we successfully optimized the design of the PDD structure, achieving both the suppression of large leakage current and satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Here, we report a detailed study on the X-ray spectroscopic performance of the XRPIX with the optimized PDD structure. The data were obtained at $-60^\circ\mathrm{C}$ with the ""event-driven readout mode"", in which only a triggering pixel and its surroundings are read out. The energy resolutions in full width at half maximum at 6.4 keV are $178\pm1$ eV and $291\pm1$ eV for single-pixel and all-pixel event spectra, respectively. The all-pixel events include charge-sharing pixel events as well as the single-pixel events. These values are the best achieved in the history of our development. We argue that the gain non-linearity in the low energy side due to excessive charge injection to the charge-sensitive amplifier is a major factor to limit the current spectroscopic performance. Optimization of the amount of the charge injection is expected to lead to further improvement in the spectroscopic performance of XRPIX, especially for the all-pixel event spectrum.","['Masataka Yukumoto', 'Koji Mori', 'Ayaki Takeda', 'Yusuke Nishioka', 'Miraku Kimura', 'Yuta Fuchita', 'Taiga Yoshida', 'Takeshi G.

Radio and Optical Properties of the blazar PKS 1614+051 at z=3.21,"We present a study of the radio and optical properties of the high-frequency peaker (HFP) blazar PKS 1614+051 at $z=3.21$ based on the data covering the time period of 1997-2024. The radio data are represented by the almost instantaneous 1-22 GHz measurements from the SAO RAS RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the IAA RAS RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope of CrAO RAS. The optical measurements in the $R$ band were collected with the SAO RAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes and the ZTF archive data. We have found low overall variability indices (0.1-0.2) and a spectral peak around 4.6 GHz, which is stable during the long-term period of monitoring. An analysis of the radio light curves reveals significant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along with variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest frame, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts. Spectral modeling suggests the presence of both synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) processes. Based on the SSA model, we provide estimates of the magnetic field strength, which peaks at $\sim\!30$ mG. A spectroscopic study with the BTA SCORPIO-I spectrograph has found signs of the regular motion of a neutral hydrogen envelope around the blazar center, which confirms the presence of enough gaseous matter to form an external FFA screen. The results highlight the importance of multiwavelength and long-term monitoring to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability in high-redshift blazars.","['Yu. V. Sotnikova', 'A. G.

A Synthetic Population of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources: Optical-X-ray Correlation,"This paper presents an analysis of the predicted optical-to-X-ray spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm ox}$) within the context of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) associated with stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. We use the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate the evolution of binary systems and investigate the relationship between UV and X-ray emission during the ULX phase, namely the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation. The study investigates the impact of metallicity on $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant anti-correlation between $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$), consistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with metallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent slope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of ULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data, and the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with metallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower metallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant impact on the XLF and $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates, where the emission is focused into narrower cones. Furthermore, the study finds that UV emission in ULXs is predominantly disk-dominated, which is the likely origin of the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation, with the percentage of disk-dominated ULXs increasing as metallicity rises.","['Lutendo Nyadzani', 'Soebur Razzaque', 'Justin D.

SF2A Environmental Transition Commission: What kind of astrophysics research for a sustainable world?,"During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy \&amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fourth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French astrophysics research community. This year had a special context: both the CNRS-INSU and the CNES were preparing their scientific perspectives for the period 2025-2030 in the field of Astronomy-Astrophysics (AA). In this proceeding, we first describe the main actions undertaken by the Commission Transition Environnementale. Then, we summarize the discussions held during the half-day workshop, which brought together about 100 participants, and point to forthcoming proceeding, reports and other related resources. A key message is that the French A\&amp;A community is now fully aware that astronomical activities simply cannot thrive indefinitely in the current situation, and seems now eager to seize the opportunity of developing our profession towards a better social and environmental impact.","['F Cantalloube', 'D Barret', 'M Bouffard', 'P Hennebelle', 'J Milli', 'F Malbet', 'A Santerne', 'N Fargette', 'S Bontemps', 'C Moutou', 'A Mouinié', 'H Méheut', 'A Saint-Martin', 'A Hardy']",0.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12716,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Physics and Society'],,"Les compte-rendus de la semaine de l'astrophysique fran{\c c}aise 2024, M.

IXPE observations of supernova remnants,"Supernova remnants (SNRs) are among the most important sources of non-thermal X-rays in the sky and likely contributors to Galactic cosmic rays and represent ideal targets to showcase the capabilities of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in performing spatially-resolved X-ray polarimetry. For the first time, we can determine the turbulence level (through the measurement of polarization degree) and the orientation (through polarization direction) of the magnetic field near the shocks, where particle acceleration occurs. IXPE reported so far the results of the observations of four SNRs: Cas A, Tycho, SN 1006 and RX J1713.7-3946. These objects exhibit a wide range of characteristics, including dynamical age, spectral composition of emission, and progenitor type.

Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback,"The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.","['Piyush Sharda', 'Shyam H.

Fast Bayesian spectral analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks: Applications over GONG H$\alpha$ solar data,"Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations.Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network.Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach.Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports.Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.","['G.

Large discrepancies in error estimates for reverberation times derived from light curves of active galactic nuclei,"Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.",['C.

A Study of Subsurface Convection Zones of Fast Rotating Massive Stars,"The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.","['Xiao-long He', 'Guo-liang Lv', 'Chun-hua Zhu', 'Lin Li', 'He-lei Liu', 'Su-fen Guo', 'Xi-zhen Lu', 'Lei Li', 'Hao Wang']",10.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12758,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['stars: massive — stars: evolution', 'convection — stars: early-type — stars: rotation 1 INTRODUCTION Massive stars ( M≥8M⊙) take an important role in many fields of modern astrophysics (Kobayashi et al', 'turbulence']",2025-01-23
The Impact of Bar-induced Non-Circular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves,"We study the impact of bar-induced non-circular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that non-circular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the position angle difference ($\Delta \phi$) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For $\left|\Delta \phi\right|\lesssim40^\circ$, non-circular motions produce a bar-induced ""dip"" feature (rise-drop-rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (${\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA barred galaxies sample. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the ""dip"" feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low $\left|\Delta \phi\right|$ streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance $V_\mathrm{los}$, while those in the bar tend to suppress $V_\mathrm{los}$. We use a simple {\misaell} model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (${\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$) and the discrepancy between ${\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$ and ${\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced ""dip"" feature in the RCs of barred galaxies combining both simulations and observations.","['Jie Liu', 'Zhi Li', 'Juntai Shen']",12.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12760,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: rotation curve - galaxies: fundamental parameters - galaxies: kinematics and dynamics - galaxies: structures - galaxies: hydrodynamic simulations 1'],2025-01-23
Massive star clusters in the gamma-ray sky: the role of HII regions,"Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (< 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.","['Giada Peron', 'Giovanni Morlino', 'Stefano Gabici', 'Elena Amato']",3.0,5.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12767,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Cosmic Rays 1', 'HII regions', 'Gamma rays', 'Star clusters']",2025-01-23

X-ray reverberation black hole mass and distance estimates of Cygnus X-1,"We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona. We fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable values of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The models both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their treatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return different mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future reverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to constrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised via Bayesian priors.","[""Patrick O'Neill"", 'Adam Ingram', 'Edward Nathan', 'Guglielmo Mastroserio', 'Michiel van der Klis', 'Matteo Lucchini', 'Jake Mitchell']",16.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12788,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['powered by accretion of matter from a companion star onto the black hole', 'black hole physics – accretion', 'accretion discs – X-rays: binaries – X-rays: individuals: Cygnus X-1 1 INTRODUCTION Black hole X-ray binary (BHXB) systems are powerful X-ray sources']",2025-01-23

The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion frequency hierarchy treatment,"Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.","['Sara Evangelista', 'Jens Chluba', 'Francesco Pace']",11.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12822,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-23
Horizontal flows in the atmospheres of chemically peculiar stars,"Context. Classical chemically peculiar stars exhibit atmospheres that are often structured by the effects of atomic diffusion. As a result of these elemental diffusion and horizontal abundance variations, photospheric temperature varies at a given height in the atmosphere. This may lead to horizontal flows in the photosphere. In addition, the suppression of such flows by magnetic field can alter the elemental transport processes. Aims. Using a simplified model of such a structured atmosphere and 2D MHD simulations of a typical He-rich star, we examine atmospheric flows in these chemically peculiar stars which often are strongly magnetic. Methods. We use Zeus-MP which is a Fortran 90 based publicly available parallel finite element modular code. Results. We find that for non-magnetic stars of spectral type BA, atmospheric flow related to horizontal temperature gradient can reach 1.0 km/s yielding mixing timescale of order of tens of days. For the magnetic counterparts, the flow speeds are an order of magnitude lower allowing for stratification of chemical elements. Conclusions. Magnetic field can influence the dynamics in atmospheres significantly. Strong horizontal magnetic field inhibits flow in the vertical direction, while strong vertical magnetic field can suppress horizontal atmospheric flow preventing elemental mixing.","['A. ud-Doula', 'J.

"The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation","We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.","['Hristijan Kochankovski', 'Georgios Lioutas', 'Sebastian Blacker', 'Andreas Bauswein', 'Angels Ramos', 'Laura Tolos']",28.0,30.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12905,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,[],2025-01-23
"Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC","Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes.

Dust production through collisions between small bodies: an application to the G-ring arc,"The G-ring arc of Saturn, confined by the 7:6 corotation eccentric resonance with Mimas, is primarily composed of micrometric particles. These particles, significantly influenced by the solar radiation pressure, are subject to rapid depletion. This study investigates a mechanism for dust replenishment in the arc, specifically analyzing collisions between macroscopic bodies and the satellite Aegaeon. Utilizing N-body and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we assess the dust generation from these impacts, with a focus on the most likely collision parameters derived from the N-body simulations. Our findings indicate that, while collisions among macroscopic bodies are inefficient for dust production, impacts involving Aegaeon are substantially more effective, providing conservative lower limits for dust generation. This mechanism, in conjunction with the natural decay processes and continuous dust generation from impacts, potentially keeps the arc population over thousands of years with a possible variation in brightness.","['V.

A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models,"First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state.

BayesEoR: Bayesian 21-cm Power Spectrum Estimation from Interferometric Visibilities,"BayesEoR is a GPU-accelerated, MPI-compatible Python package for estimating the power spectrum of redshifted 21-cm emission from interferometric observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Utilizing a Bayesian framework, BayesEoR jointly fits for the 21-cm EoR power spectrum and a ""foreground"" model, referring to bright, contaminating emission between us and the cosmological signal, and forward models the instrument with which these signals are observed. To perform the sampling, we use MultiNest [arXiv:1402.0004], which calculates the Bayesian evidence as part of the analysis.

The AGILE space mission: an Italian success story and its legacy for future space astronomy,"AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero) has been a unique and hugely successful mission of Italian Space Agency (ASI), built and operated with the programmatic and technical support of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), several universities and Italian industries. During almost 17 years of observations in orbit (from April 23, 2007, to January 18, 2024), AGILE contributed to high-energy astrophysics and terrestrial physics with many discoveries and detections. Two co-aligned X- and gamma-ray detectors, a silicon-strip-based tracker, a wide field of view gamma-ray imager and the fast-reaction ground segment were the AGILE innovative solutions with respect to the previous generation of gamma-ray satellites. With the AGILE's re-entry, the in-orbit operational phase ends, but a new phase of scientific work on the satellite legacy data archive opens: AGILE may still hold future surprises.","['Carlotta Pittori', 'Marco Tavani', 'Andrea Argan', 'Andrea Bulgarelli', 'Guido Barbiellini', 'Luca Salotti', 'Elisabetta Tommasi', 'Elisabetta Cavazzuti', ""Fabio D'Amico"", 'Giovanno Valentini', 'Munzer Jahjah', 'Barbara Negri', 'Giovanni Annoni']",8.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12970,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['Gamma-ray telescopes · Astronomical satellites · High Energy Astrophysics · Gamma-ray Astronomy · Astronomical data bases · Data Center Acronyms/Abbreviations Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Gamma-ray Imaging Detector (GRID) Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) Gravitational Waves (GW) Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) Space Science Data Center (SSDC) Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGF) 1'],2025-01-23
DASCH: Bringing 100+ Years of Photographic Data into the 21st Century and Beyond,"The Harvard College Observatory was the preeminent astronomical data center of the early 20th century: it gathered and archived an enormous collection of glass photographic plates that became, and remains, the largest in the world.

In early 2024, after 470,000 scans, the DASCH project finished. Now, this unique analog dataset can be integrated into 21st-century, digital analyses. The key DASCH data products include ~200 TB of plate images, ~16 TB of calibrated light curves, and a variety of supporting metadata and calibration outputs. Virtually every part of the sky is covered by thousands of DASCH images with a time baseline spanning more than 100 years; most stars brighter than B ~ 15 have hundreds or thousands of detections.

Can supermassive stars form in protogalaxies due to internal Lyman-Werner feedback?,"Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.","['James Sullivan', 'Zoltan Haiman', 'Mihir Kulkarni', 'Eli Visbal']",21.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12986,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['stars: Population III – stars: massive – stars: black holes – galaxies: star-formation 1 INTRODUCTION Supermassiveblackholes(SMBHs)arefoundatthecenterofnearly all nearby galaxies (Kormendy & Ho 2013) and play a major role in their evolution'],2025-01-23
eROSITA X-ray Analysis of the PeVatron Candidate Westerlund 1,"It is unclear which fraction of cosmic rays above an energy of 1 PeV is accelerated by the observed Galactic PeVatron population. These sources' gamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray population. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458, associated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the diffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of thermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron emission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new constraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population of this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to spectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1, we compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal component. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which coincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that eROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios for the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we find no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence bound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1, which we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From this, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS J1646-458 of 7 uG. This is compatible with a previous estimate in the literature for a fully leptonic source scenario. A purely leptonic emission scenario, a hadronic, and a hybrid one are compatible with our results.","['Konstantin Haubner', 'Manami Sasaki', 'Alison Mitchell', 'Gabriele Ponti', 'Gavin Rowell', 'Sabrina Einecke', 'Miroslav Filipović', 'Sanja Lazarević', 'Gerd Pühlhofer', 'Andrew Strong']",10.0,18.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12990,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['outflows – open clusters and associations: individ- ual: Westerlund 1 – X-rays: stars 1', 'acceleration of particles – cosmic rays – shock waves – stars: winds', 'in the respective headers']",2025-01-23

The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.","['E. J. Buis', 'A.

Constraining the shape of dark matter haloes using only starlight. I. A new technique and its application to the galaxy Nube,"We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy 'Nube' was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.","['Jorge Sanchez Almeida', 'Ignacio Trujillo', 'Mireia Montes', 'Angel R.

We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give origin to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow. We find that we need a quite high sideways velocity for the streaming environment (of ~30km/s) in order to produce the complex structure observed in HH 110.

High-Frequency Power Spectrum of AGN NGC 4051 Revealed by NICER,"Variability studies offer a compelling glimpse into black hole dynamics, and NICER's (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) remarkable temporal resolution propels us even further. NICER observations of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 10,000 Hz in a galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10 M_{\odot}. No extra high-frequency break/bend or any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints on current models of X-ray emission and variability in AGN.","['B. Rani', 'Jungeun Kim', 'I. Papadakis', 'K.C. Gendreau', 'M. Masterson', 'K.

On the Use of WGANs for Super Resolution in Dark-Matter Simulations,"Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations.

The outer structure of old star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"We report results on the internal dynamical evolution of old star clusters located in the outer regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Because the SMC has been imprinted with evidence of tidal interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we investigated at what extend such an interaction has produced extra tidal structures or excess of stars beyond the clusters' tidal radii. For that purpose, we used the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 data sets to build number density radial profiles of suitable star clusters, and derived their structural and internal dynamics parameters. The analysed stellar density profiles do not show any evidence of tidal effects caused by the LMC. On the contrary, the Jacobi volume of the selected SMC star clusters would seem underfilled, with a clear trend toward a smaller percentage of underfilled volume as their deprojected distance to the SMC centre increases. Moreover, the internal dynamical evolution of SMC star clusters would seem to be influenced by the SMC gravitational field, being star clusters located closer to the SMC centre in a more advanced evolutionary stage. We compared the internal dynamical evolution of SMC old star clusters with those of LMC and Milky Way globular clusters, and found that Milky Way globular clusters have dynamical evolutionary paths similar to LMC/SMC old star clusters located closer to their respective galaxy's centres. Finally, we speculate with the possibility that globular clusters belonging to Magellanic Clouds like-mass galaxies have lived a couple of times their median relaxation times.",['Andrés E.

BlackTHUNDER -- A non-stellar Balmer break in a black hole-dominated little red dot at $z=7.04$,"Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\rm dyn}<4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.","['Xihan Ji', 'Roberto Maiolino', 'Hannah Übler', 'Jan Scholtz', ""Francesco D'Eugenio"", 'Fengwu Sun', 'Michele Perna', 'Hannah Turner', 'Santiago Arribas', 'Jake S.

Innovative Web Tool for Remote Data Acquisition and Analysis: Customized for SKA Low frequency Beamforming Test Bed LPDA Array at Gauribidanur Radio Observatory,"With the evolution of radio astronomy, related education and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems in data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience.

The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications.

The Machine Learning to reconstruct GRB lightcurves,"The current knowledge in cosmology deals with open problems whose solutions are still under investigation. The main issue is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the $4-6 \sigma$ discrepancy between the local value of $H_0$ obtained with Cepheids+Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the cosmological one estimated from the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For the investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$ ranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$, and CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at intermediate redshift $z>3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern cosmology. The Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are particularly suitable for this task, given their observability up to $z=9.4$. The use of GRBs as standardizable candles requires the use of tight and reliable astrophysical correlations and the presence of gaps in the GRB time-domain data represents an obstacle in this sense. In this work, we propose to improve the precision of the lightcurve (LC) parameters through a reconstruction process performed with the functional forms of GRB LCs and the Gaussian Processes (GP). The filling of gaps in the GRB LCs through these processes shows an improvement up to $41.5\%$ on the precision of the LC parameters fitting, which lead to a reduced scatter in the astrophysical correlations and, thus, in the estimation of cosmological parameters.","['Maria Giovanna Dainotti', 'Biagio De Simone', 'Aditya Narendra', 'Agnieszka Pollo']",1.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13102,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,"Acta Astronomica Sinica,2024,65(6):58",[],2025-01-23
Two decades of optical variability of Small Magellanic Cloud high-mass X-ray binaries,"We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.","['Helena Treiber', 'Georgios Vasilopoulos', 'Charles Bailyn', 'Frank Haberl', 'Andrzej Udalski']",24.0,33.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13147,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",A&A,,"['Stars: emission-line', 'Be – Stars: neutron – (Stars:) pulsars: general – (Galaxies:) Magellanic Clouds – X-rays: binaries 1']",2025-01-24
Using simulation based inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies: the dynamics of NGC205,"We develop a novel approach to performing precision inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies. We use a Bayesian inference framework of implicit likelihood inference, previously applied mainly in the field of cosmology, based on forward simulation, data compression, and likelihood emulation with neural density estimators. We consider the case of NGC205, a satellite of M31. NGC205 exhibits an S-shape in the mean line-of-sight velocity along its semi-major spatial axis, suggestive of tidal perturbation. We demonstrate that this velocity profile can be qualitatively reproduced even if NGC205 was in a spherically symmetric and isotropic state before its most recent pericenter passage. We apply our inference method to mock data and show that the precise shape of a perturbed satellite's sky-projected internal velocity field can be highly informative of both its orbit and total mass density profile, even in the absence of proper motion information. For the actual NGC205, our method is hampered because the available data only covers a line along its semi-major axis, rather than the full sky-projected field. This shortcoming could be addressed with another round of observations.","['Axel Widmark', 'Kathryn V.

Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions,"For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. Peculiar motions on the sky are only measured for a few cases. With increasingly detailed observations, the assumption that line-of-sight velocities suffice for an accurate and precise reconstruction of galaxy kinematics needs to be re-investigated and the impact of perpendicular velocities to be quantified. We analyse the motion of two galaxies with arbitrary velocities, determine their mutual velocity on an arbitrary background, and compare this general relative velocity to the one from line-of-sight components only. The latter are known as ``minor and major infall models'' established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Our derivations reveal that the infall models approximate the radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies with small angular separations, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight velocities. For larger angles, the minor infall model is mostly suitable when perpendicular velocity components are negligible and there is no information about the tangential velocity of the binary. The major infall model is best suitable when the motion is mainly radial and symmetry assumptions cancel the tangential and one perpendicular component. The latter often requires to transition from galaxy binaries to groups or clusters, as we show quantitatively. We give an encompassing overview how the infall models over- and under-estimate general binary or $N$-body motions. We quantify the impact of perpendicular velocity components, sparse sampling, and deviations of the tracer-galaxies from the motion in an embedding gravitational potential which are related to the angular momentum of the structure.

The Hubble Space Telescope Survey of M31 Satellite Galaxies IV. Survey Overview and Lifetime Star Formation Histories,"From $>1000$ orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies ($-6 \ge M_V \ge -17$) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within $1.8$ Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) $\sim50$\% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation ($>12$ Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching ($8-10$ Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent.

Implications of Magnetic Flux-Disk Mass Correlation in Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers for GRB sub-populations,"We perform numerical relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers with a fixed mass ratio of $q = 3$, varying the BH spin to produce a wide range of post-merger accretion disk masses. Our high-order numerical scheme, fine resolution, and Large Eddy Simulation techniques enable us to achieve likely the most resolved BH-NS merger simulations to date, capturing the post-merger magnetic field amplification driven by turbulent dynamo processes. Following tidal disruption and during disk formation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the spiral arm drives a turbulent state in which the magnetic field, initialized to a realistic average value of $10^{11}\, \rm{G}$, grows to an average of approximately $10^{14}\, \rm{G}$ in the first $\approx 20\, \mathrm{ms}$ post-merger. Notably, the dimensionless magnetic flux on the BH, $ \phi $, evolves similarly across nearly two orders of magnitude in disk mass. This similarity, along with estimates from longer numerical simulations of the decay of the mass accretion rate, suggests a universal timescale at which the dimensionless flux saturates at a magnetically arrested state (MAD) such that $ \phi \approx 50 $ at $t_{\rm MAD} \gtrsim 10\,{\rm s}$. The unified framework of Gottlieb et al. (2023) established that the MAD timescale sets the duration of the resulting compact binary gamma-ray burst (cbGRB), implying that all BH-NS mergers contribute to the recently detected new class of long-duration cbGRBs.","['Manuel R.

Time-Dependent Radiation Transport Simulations of Infrared Echoes from Dust-Shrouded Luminous Transients,"A wide range of stellar explosions, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events (TDE), and fast blue optical transients (FBOT), can occur in dusty environments initially opaque to the transient's optical/UV light, becoming visible only once the dust is destroyed by the transient's rising luminosity. We present axisymmetric time-dependent radiation transport simulations of dust-shrouded transients with \texttt{Athena++} and tabulated gray opacities, which predict the light-curves of the dust-reprocessed infrared (IR) radiation. The luminosity and timescale of the IR light-curve depends on whether the transient rises rapidly or slowly compared to the light crossing-time of the photosphere, $t_{\rm lc}$. For slow-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \gg t_{\rm lc}$) such as SNe, the reprocessed IR radiation diffuses outwards through the dust shell faster than the sublimation front expands; the IR light-curve therefore begins rising prior to the escape of UV/optical light, but peaks on a timescale $\sim t_{\rm rise}$ shorter than the transient duration. By contrast, for fast-rising transients ($t_{\rm rise} \ll t_{\rm lc}$) such as FBOTs and some TDEs, the finite light-travel time results in the reprocessed radiation arriving as an ``echo'' lasting much longer than the transient itself (despite the dust photosphere having already being destroyed by peak light). We explore the effects of the system geometry by considering a torus-shaped distribution of dust. The IR light-curves seen by observers in the equatorial plane of the torus resemble those for a spherical dust shell, while polar observers see faster-rising, brighter and shorter-lived emission. We successfully model the IR excess seen in AT2018cow as a dust echo, supporting the presence of an opaque dusty medium surrounding FBOTs prior to explosion.","['Semih Tuna', 'Brian D.

The Environmental Quenching Mechanisms of Field Dwarf Galaxies,"Field dwarf galaxies not actively forming stars are relatively rare in the local Universe, but are present in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We use the TNG50 simulation to investigate their origin and find that they all result from environmental effects that have removed or reduced their gas content. Quenched field dwarfs consist of either backsplash objects ejected from a massive host or of systems that have lost their gas after crossing overdense regions such as filaments or sheets (``cosmic web stripping''). Quenched fractions rise steeply with decreasing stellar mass, with quenched systems making up roughly $\sim 15\%$ of all field dwarfs (i.e., excluding satellites) with stellar masses $10^{7}<M_{\star}/M_{\odot}<10^{9}$. This fraction drops to only $\sim1\%$ when a strict isolation criterion that requires no neighbours with $M_{\star}>10^9\, M_{\odot}$ within {$1.5$} Mpc is applied. Of these isolated dwarfs, $\sim 6\%$ are backsplash, while the other $\sim 94\%$ have been affected by the cosmic web. Backsplash systems are more deficient in dark matter, have retained less or no gas, and have stopped forming stars earlier than cosmic web-stripped systems. The discovery of deeply isolated dwarf galaxies which were quenched relatively recently would lend observational support to the prediction that the cosmic web is capable of inducing the cessation of star formation in dwarfs.","['José A.

COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone,"Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.","['Mélanie Chevance', 'J.

Spectro-temporal Investigation of Quasi-periodic Oscillations From Black Hole X-ray Binary 4U 1630-472 Using $\textit{NICER}$,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectro-temporal characteristics of the X-ray variabilities from black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472 during its three outbursts (2018, 2020, and 2021) as observed by $\textit{NICER}$. We detected 27 Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), out of which 25 were observed during the 2021 outburst. In this study, we specifically focus on the relationship between spectral and timing parameters and the frequency of type-C QPOs in the 2021 outburst of the black hole binary 4U 1630-472 during its rising phase. We found strong correlations between the photon index of the non-thermal emission and the QPO frequency. We also observed a critical frequency at $\sim$ 2.31 Hz, above which the behavior of the Q-factor of the QPO changed significantly with the QPO frequency. We further identified two events characterized by a surge in the total flux, corresponding to the disappearance of type-C QPOs. Although the first event appeared like an X-ray flare, during the second event, the source reached a state with a total flux higher than 10$^{-8}$ erg/cm$^{2}$/s and exhibited a different type of QPO with lower frequencies and weaker amplitudes. We compare our results with the previously reported QPO characteristics for black hole outbursts and discuss the various models that could interpret the critical frequency and potentially explain the origin and evolution of these type-C QPOs.","['Ansh Chopra', 'Manoneeta Chakraborty', 'Unnati Kashyap']",13.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13163,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics,,"['Black hole physics', 'Stars: 4U 1630–472 1', 'X-rays: binaries', 'Accretion']",2025-01-24
Properties of Free Floating Planets Ejected through Planet-Planet Scattering,"Multiple studies have shown that planet-planet scattering plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. For instance, it has been shown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating planets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary systems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the system. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical properties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\%$ of the planets are ejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the system. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\sim 10^8-10^9$ years. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6 km/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets ejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner most planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the planetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system. Also, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the radii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the ejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the planets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the initial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction does not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the planets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed populations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets should form around each star to reproduce the observations.","['Hareesh Gautham Bhaskar', 'Hagai Perets']",17.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13166,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",,,"['free floating planets', 'exoplanets', 'dynamical astronomy 1']",2025-01-24
Global Turbulent Solar Convection: a Numerical Path Investigating Key Force Balances in the context of the Convective Conundrum,"Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number too large and a shift towards an anti-solar rotation regime. This Convective Conundrum, underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls $Ro$ while increasing the Reynolds number ($Re$) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number ($Nu$), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence ($Re \sim 800$) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an anti-solar rotating counterpart, and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, which existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium towards smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis-Inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.","['Quentin Noraz', 'Allan Sacha Brun', 'Antoine Strugarek']",20.0,27.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13169,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['kinematics and dynamics — turbulence — convection — hydrodynamics — methods: numerical 1', 'Sun: interior and rotation — stars: solar-type']",2025-01-24
Non-equilibrium ionization in the multiphase circumgalactic medium -- impact on quasar absorption-line analyses,"This paper presents an updated framework for studying the ionizing conditions and elemental abundances of photoionized, metal-enriched quasar absorption systems. The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in absorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic recombination (t_cool >> t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at high metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite of time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for the ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised UVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different elemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion fractions. A metal-enriched ($\mathrm{[\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV absorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as follows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial temperatures T_0 < 1e6 K change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion fractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between PIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than 2-$\sigma$ significance and a modest non-solar $\mathrm{[C/\alpha]} = 0.2$ is needed to explain the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP analyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high signal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal absorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.","['Suyash Kumar', 'Hsiao-Wen Chen']",7.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13170,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Extragalactic astrophysics – circumgalactic medium – quasar absorption spectroscopy – ionization modeling 1'],2025-01-24
Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry,"Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used (""classic"") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as ""special trajectories."" Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.","['Liliya Imasheva', 'H.-Thomas Janka', 'Achim Weiss']",13.0,20.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13172,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,"['supernovae: general – hydrodynamics – nuclear reactions', 'e', 'abundances 1 INTRODUCTION The study of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) has capti- vated astronomers and physicists for decades (for reviews on theoretical developments', 'nucleosyn- thesis', 'see']",2025-01-24
A Detailed Look at a Trio of Changing-Look Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributions and the Dust Extinction Test,"Changing-look quasars exhibit dramatic variability in broad emission-line fluxes on short timescales. This behavior is challenging to many models of the quasar broad line region, due in large part to the short transition times between high and low states. In order to constrain the cause of the dramatic variability, we obtained contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope UV and Hobby Eberly Telescope optical spectra of three changing-look quasars caught in their low state. We use these spectra, along with archival spectra taken during both the high and low states, to investigate potential scenarios for the change in state. Our data strongly disfavor a variable dust obscuration scenario for these three CLQs, and instead suggest that the observed transformation reflects a change in the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine. We also find that the low-state spectral energy distributions of all three quasars are reminiscent of those of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which suggests that the transition may result from a change in accretion flow structure caused by a reduced Eddington ratio.","['Laura Duffy', 'Michael Eracleous', 'Jessie C.

Resolution Dependence of Cloud-Wind Simulations,"Using a set of wind-tunnel simulations, we investigate the effect that numerical resolution has on cloud evolution and acceleration. We also consider the role of wind speed in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes, using adiabatic simulations with wind speeds of 100 km/s and 1000 km/s, respectively. For each setup, we explore five numerical resolutions. We find that the fate of the cloud is significantly affected by the resolution, but the trend is surprisingly non-monotonic. In the subsonic case, we find that a resolution of 16 cells per cloud radius is a turning point in the cloud evolution. In the supersonic case the trend is more monotonic, consistent with the difference in timescales for which ram pressure acceleration dominates over mixing in the early acceleration.","['Hannah J.

A New Measure of Assembly Bias: The Environment Dependence of the Luminosity Function,"Assembly bias is the variation of clustering induced by correlations between the assembly history of dark matter halos and the large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how assembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We measure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the original simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies are randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By comparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number of galaxies at the $\sim10\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias increases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further dilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When separating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red galaxies fainter than $\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a $\sim20\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a remarkable $50\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these measurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a robust assembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two. Overall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias, offering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to detect it in observations.","['Yikun Wang', 'Idit Zehavi', 'Sergio Contreras', 'Shaun Cole', 'Peder Norberg']",11.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13204,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['galaxies: evolution — galaxies: formation — galaxies: luminosity function — galaxies: halos — galaxies: statistics — large-scale structure of universe 1'],2025-01-24
Beyond MESA Defaults: The Impact of Structural Resolution Uncertainty in p-mode Asteroseismology,"Observations of pressure modes ($p$-modes) in stars have enabled profound insights into stellar properties, and theoretical stellar evolution and oscillation models are integral to these inferences. However, modeling uncertainties are often overlooked, even as they can rival or exceed observational uncertainties. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of structural resolution choices in 1D stellar evolution calculations on predicted $p$-mode frequencies across the HR diagram, using \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{GYRE}. We present measurements of resolution-based modeling uncertainty for a range of solar-like, upper main-sequence, and Mira oscillators and compare these directly to TESS observational uncertainties. We demonstrate that resolution-driven uncertainties can significantly influence theoretical predictions and in some cases overwhelm observational uncertainties by orders of magnitude: while solar-like oscillators typically have fractional, resolution-based uncertainties at or below 1\% of the test frequency, fractional uncertainties in Miras were as large as 20\%. We also find that the location and morphology of the RGB bump and red clump are impacted substantially by resolution uncertainty. Stellar ages are impacted at the 10\% level for young main-sequence stars, and the model-based correction factor for the $\Delta\nu$--$\sqrt{\rho}$ scaling relation is impacted at the 2\% level. Our results underscore the need to incorporate modeling uncertainties into asteroseismic analyses and provide a reference framework for observers evaluating the reliability of theoretical models.","['Yaguang Li', 'Meridith Joyce']",10.0,27.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13207,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-24

Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes,"Coronal holes (CH) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the boundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent intensities.","['Jeremy A.

The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst,"The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.","['Hao Wang', 'Chunhua Zhu', 'Guoliang Lü', 'Lin Li', 'Helei Liu', 'Sufen Guo', 'Xizhen Lu']",11.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13259,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",PRD,,['Classical Novae (251) — Neutrino astronomy (1100) — Hertzsprung Russell diagram (725) 1'],2025-01-24
The BVRcIc sky brightness of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of MSU,"In this paper we analyse the measurements of the brightness of the night sky above the CMO SAI MSU in the visible and near-infrared range made in 2019-2014. In 2023-2024 the median zenith brightness of the moonless night sky was 21.31 mag in the B band, 20.63 mag in the V band, 20.15 mag in the Rc band, and 19.11 mag in the Ic band. In 5 years the sky brightness had increased by 0.7 mag in B and V, by 0.45 mag in Rc, and ~0.1 mag in Ic. We found that the brightness growth is mostly (up to ~85%) due to the increasing light pollution from nearby cities, while the remainder can be attributed to the increase of solar activity after the 2019 minimum. We discuss how the sky brightness is influenced by such factors as the airmass and the location of the Sun and the Moon in the sky. A qualitative analysis of the sky emission spectrum has demonstrated the growing role of LED lamps in light pollution. These changes in sky brightness which are only going to get harder favour observations that are less sensitive to the degree of light pollution - IR photometry and spectroscopy and high-resolution optical spectroscopy.","['I.

Systematic opacity calculations for kilonovae -- II. Improved atomic data for singly ionized lanthanides,"Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations.

Unstable accretion in TW Hya: 3D simulations and comparisons with observations,"We investigate the origin of photometric variability in the classical T Tauri star TW Hya by comparing light curves obtained by TESS and ground-based telescopes with light curves created using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. TW Hya is modeled as a rotating star with a dipole magnetic moment, slightly tilted about the rotational axis. We observed that for various model parameters, matter accretes in the unstable regime and produces multiple hot spots on the star's surface, which leads to stochastic-looking light curves similar to the observed ones. Wavelet and Fourier spectra of observed and modeled light curves show multiple quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with quasiperiods from less than 0.1 to 9 days. Models show that variation in the strength and tilt of the dipole magnetosphere leads to different periodograms, where the period of the star may dominate or be hidden. The amplitude of QPOs associated with the stellar period can be smaller than that of other QPOs if the tilt of the dipole magnetosphere is small and when the unstable regime is stronger. In models with small magnetospheres, the short-period QPOs associated with rotation of the inner disc dominate and can be mistaken for a stellar period. We show that longer-period (5-9 days) QPOs can be caused by waves forming beyond the corotation radius.","['M. M. Romanova', 'C. C. Espaillat', 'J. Wendeborn', 'J.-F. Donati', 'P. P. Petrov', 'R. V.

One-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere around a Kerr black hole,"We perform one-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of the propagation of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere along magnetic field lines around a spinning black hole. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfven waves. As in a previous study using the Banados--Teitelboim--Zanelli spacetime (Koide et al. 2022), the Alfven wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonic wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfven wave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation.","['Shinji Koide', 'Sousuke Noda', 'Masaaki Takahashi']",11.0,43.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13314,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,"['magneticﬁelds', 'plasmas', 'Alfv ´ enwaves', 'methods: numerical', 'galaxies: nuclei 1', 'general relativity', 'galaxies: active', 'black holephysics']",2025-01-24
Simulations of the accreted stellar halos of low-mass field galaxies,"We predict the properties of stellar halos in galaxies of present-day virial mass $10^8 < M_{200} < 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ by combining the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, the COCO cosmological N-body simulation, and the STINGS particle tagging technique. Galaxies in low mass halos have a wide range of stellar halo properties. Their diversity is much greater at fixed stellar mass than fixed virial mass. In the least massive DM halos capable of supporting galaxy formation, accreted mass fractions are < 10 per cent, and the typical density profile of accreted stars is similar to that of stars formed in situ. In low mass galaxies, the radial scale lengths of accreted stellar halos are smaller than those of stellar disks formed in situ, but the accreted component is still diffuse, not bulge-like. At the scale of galaxies like M33, the surface density of accreted stars exceeds that of the in situ component at ~15kpc; the accreted surface density at this radius is $3.5\lesssim \log_{10} M_\star/{\rm M_\odot} \mathrm{kpc^{-2}} \lesssim 6$, varying systematically with virial mass. We compare our predictions to observations and other cosmological simulations. A small but significant number of $\sim 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ halos with exceptionally inefficient star formation -- ""failed Milky Ways"" -- are more prominent in our model than others; the true abundance of this population is a potential constraint on galaxy formation physics and could be measured by low surface brightness surveys targeting field galaxies with M33-like stellar mass.

Modelling the energy dependent X-ray variability of Mrk 335,"We present a technique which predicts the energy dependent fractional r.m.s for linear correlated variations of a pair of spectral parameters and apply it to an XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335. The broadband X-ray spectrum can be interpreted as a patchy absorber partially covering the primary emission, a warm and hot coronal emission or a relativistically blurred reflection along with the primary emission. The fractional r.m.s has a non-monotonic behavior with energy for segments of lengths 3 and 6 ksecs. For each spectral model, we consider every pair of spectral parameters and fit the predicted r.m.s with the observed ones, to get the pair which provides the best fit. We find that a variation in at least two parameters is required for all spectral interpretations. For both time segments, variations in the covering fraction of the absorber and the primary power law index gives the best result for the partial covering model, while a variation in the normalization and spectral index of the warm component gives the best fit in the two corona interpretation. For the reflection model, the best fit parameters are different for the two time segment lengths, and the results suggests that more than two parameters are required to explain the data. This, combined with the extreme values of emissivity index and reflection fraction parameters obtained from the spectral analysis, indicates that the blurred reflection model might not be a suitable explanation for the Mrk 335 spectrum. We discuss the results as well as the potential of the technique to be applied to other data sets of different AGN.","['K. Akhila', 'Ranjeev Misra', 'Rathin Sarma', 'Savithri H. Ezhikode', 'K.

Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves,"Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to study their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($<10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is in most cases low ($<0.5$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.","['Alejandro Torres-Orjuela', 'Verónica Vázquez-Aceves', 'Tian-Xiao Wang']",8.0,16.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13466,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,['Gravitational wave sources(677) — Intermediate-mass black holes(816) — Gravitational interaction(669) — Star clusters(1567) — Gravitational wave astronomy(675) 1'],2025-01-24
GRB 221009A and the Apparently Most Energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are often referred to as the most luminous explosions in the Universe, due to their short and highly luminous prompt emission. This apparent luminosity, however, does not reflect the true energy budget of the prompt emission, which is strongly beamed. Accurate estimations of the energy radiated during the prompt phase require taking into account the geometry of GRB jets, which remains poorly known. Nevertheless, one may establish the distribution of well measured quantities, like Eiso, the GRB isotropic equivalent energy, which encrypts crucial information about GRB jets, with the aim of providing constraints on the jets radiated energy. In this work, we study the bright end of the GRB isotropic equivalent energy distribution (hereafter called ""apparent energy""), using an updated sample of 185 apparently energetic GRBs with Eiso $\geq 10^{53}$ erg. This new sample includes GRB 221009A, allowing to discuss this apparently super-energetic GRB in the context of the general Eiso distribution of long GRBs. We describe the construction of the sample and compare fits of the Eiso distribution with a simple power law, a cutoff power law and a broken power law. Our study confirms the existence of a cutoff around Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg, even when GRB 221009A is included in the sample. Based on this finding, we discuss the possible reasons behind the rapid decrease of the number of apparently energetic gamma-ray bursts beyond Eiso = $4\times10^{54}$ erg and the interpretation of GRB 221009A, the most apparently energetic GRB detected to date, in this context.","['J-L.

What is Inside the Double-Double Structure of the Radio Galaxy J0028+0035?,"The radio source J0028+0035 is a recently discovered double--double radio galaxy at redshift z=0.398. Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in the sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale structure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the arcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature that offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third pair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double source where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be observed. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we conducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network. Our 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact central radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature. The observation performed in multi-phase-centre mode also revealed that the physically unrelated but in projection closely separated background source 5BZU J0028+0035 has a single weak, somewhat resolved radio feature, at odds with its blazar classification.","['S.

Transit-timing variations in the AU Mic system observed with CHEOPS,"AU Mic is a very active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk and two transiting sub-Neptunes with a possible third planetary companion. The two transiting planets exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs) that are caused by the gravitational interaction between the bodies in the system. Using photometrical observations taken with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), our goal is to constrain the planetary radii, the orbital distances and periods of AU Mic b and c. We aim to determine the superperiod of the TTVs for AU Mic b and to update the transit ephemeris for both planets. Based on the observed TTVs, we study the possible presence of a third planet in the system. We conducted high precision photometric observations with CHEOPS in 2022 and 2023. We used Allesfitter to fit the planetary transits and to constrain the planetary and orbital parameters. We combined our new measurements with results from previous years to determine the periods and amplitudes of the TTVs. We applied dynamical modelling based on TTV measurements from the 2018-2023 period to reconstruct the perceived variations. The orbital distances and periods for AU Mic b and c agree with the results from previous works. However, the values for the planetary radii deviate slightly from previous values, which we attribute to the effect of stellar spots. AU Mic c showed very strong TTVs, with transits that occurred ~80 minutes later in 2023 than in 2021. Through dynamical analysis of the system, we found that the observed TTVs can be explained by a third planet with an orbital period of ~12.6 days and a mass of 0.203+0.022-0.024 M_E. We explored the orbital geometry of the system and found that AU Mic c has a misaligned retrograde orbit. Due limited number of observations the exact configuration and planetary parameters could not be determined. Further monitoring with CHEOPS may improve these results.","['Á. Boldog', 'Gy. M.

Alpha-element abundance patterns in star-forming regions of the local Universe,"(Abridged) We reassess the alpha-element abundance ratios (Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O) with respect to metallicity in ~1000 spectra of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) of the local Universe. Using the DEep Spectra of Ionised REgions Database (DESIRED) Extended project (DESIRED-E), which includes spectra with direct electron temperature determinations, we homogeneously derive physical conditions and chemical abundances for all objects. Various ionisation correction factor (ICF) schemes are analyzed for Ne, S, and Ar to identify the most reliable abundance estimates. Our findings indicate that the ICF scheme by Izotov et al. (2006) better reproduces the Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O trends. Ne/O ratios in HII regions display large dispersion and no clear dependence on O/H, suggesting that current ICF(Ne) schemes fail for these objects. However, SFGs show consistent linear relations with slightly positive slopes for log(Ne/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) or 12+log(Ne/H), likely influenced by metallicity-dependent O dust depletion and ICF effects. The log(S/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) distribution is largely constant, especially for HII regions or combined samples (SFGs + HII regions). Conversely, log(S/O) vs. 12+log(S/H) shows a tight linear fit with a positive slope, flattening at 12+log(S/H) < 6.0, suggesting S contributions from SNe Ia. For log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(O/H), similar trends emerge for HII regions and SFGs, independent of ionisation degree or ICF(Ar). A slight log(Ar/O) decrease with increasing 12+log(O/H) contrasts with log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(Ar/H), which shows a small positive slope, indicating a possible minor Ar contribution from SNe Ia.","['C.

Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA,"Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.","['Matthias Daniel', 'Kris Pardo', 'Laura Sagunski']",5.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13601,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['supermassive black hole binaries - gravitational waves - dark matter - LISA I'],2025-01-24
The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (I): Revealing the energy source with photometry and spectroscopy,"Some core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are too luminous and radiate too much total energy to be powered by the release of thermal energy from the ejecta and radioactive-decay energy from the synthesised $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co. A source of additional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a massive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type IIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but not all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both luminous, with $M_{o} < -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than $M_{o} = -18$ mag for $\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is required to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also investigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated with the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an order of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much longer. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show multi-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of absorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (< 85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry in emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d. Analysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape of the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as extensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed asymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained with emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an IR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.","['T. M. Reynolds', 'T. Nagao', 'R.

The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (II): Estimating the CSM mass and geometry with polarimetry and light curve modeling,"There is evidence for interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and massive circumstellar material (CSM) in various types of SNe. The mass-ejection mechanisms that produce massive CSM are unclear, and studying interacting SNe and their CSM can shed light on these mechanisms and the final stages of stellar evolution. We aim to study the properties of the CSM in the bright, long-lived, hydrogen-rich (Type II) SN 2021irp, which is interacting with a massive aspherical CSM. We present imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations of SN 2021irp. By modelling its polarisation and bolometric light curve, we derive the mass and distribution of the CSM. SN 2021irp shows a high intrinsic polarisation of $\sim0.8$%. This high continuum polarisation suggests an aspherical photosphere created by an aspherical CSM interaction. Based on the bolometric light curve evolution and the high polarization, SN 2021irp can be explained as a typical Type II SN interacting with a CSM disk with a corresponding mass-loss rate and half-opening angle of $\sim0.035$ - $0.1$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim30$ - $50^{\circ}$, respectively. The total CSM mass derived is $\gtrsim 2$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest that this CSM disk was created by some process related to binary interaction, and that SN 2021irp is the end product of a typical massive star (i.e. with Zero-Age-Main-Sequence mass of $\sim 8-18$ M$_{\odot}$) that has a separation and/or mass ratio with its companion star that led to an extreme mass ejection within decades of explosion. Based on the observational properties of SN 2021irp and similar SNe, we propose a general picture for the spectroscopic properties of Type II SNe interacting with a massive disk CSM.","['T. M.

A Fast and Accurate Implementation of the Effective Fluid Approximation for Ultralight Axions,"We present a numerically efficient and accurate implementation of the Passaglia-Hu effective fluid approximation for ultralight axions (ULAs) within the Boltzmann code CAMB. This method is specifically designed to evolve the axion field accurately across cosmological timescales, mitigating the challenges associated with its rapid oscillations. Our implementation is based on the latest version of CAMB, ensuring compatibility with other cosmological codes., e.g. for calculating cosmological parameter constraints. Compared to exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, our method achieves sub-percent accuracy in the CMB power spectrum across a broad range of axion masses, from $10^{-28}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-24}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses incorporating our implementation, and find improved constraints on the axion mass and abundance compared to previous, simpler fluid-based approximations. For example, using \Planck\ PR4 and DESI BAO data, we find $2\sigma$ upper limits on the axion fraction $f_{\rm ax} < 0.0082$ and physical density $\Omega_{\rm ax}h^2 < 0.0010$ for $m=10^{-28}$ eV.

Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas,"We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfvén-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfvén-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfvén waves and Alfvénic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfvén-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfvén-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.","['A. F. A. Bott', 'M. W. Kunz', 'E. Quataert', 'J.

Estimating the Poynting flux of Alfv\'enic waves in polar coronal holes across Solar Cycle 24,"Alfvénic waves are known to be prevalent throughout the corona and solar wind. Determining the Poynting flux supplied by the waves is required for constraining their role in plasma heating and acceleration, as well as providing a constraint for Alfvén wave driven models that aim to predict coronal and solar wind properties. Previous studies of the Alfvénic waves in polar coronal holes have been able to provide a measure of energy flux for arbitrary case studies. Here we build upon previous work and take a more systematic approach, examining if there is evidence for any variation in vertical Poynting flux over the course of the solar cycle. We use imaging data from SDO/AIA to measure the displacements of the fine-scale structure present in coronal holes. It is found that the measure for vertical Poynting flux is broadly similar over the solar cycle, implying a consistent contribution from waves to the energy budget of the solar wind. There is variation in energy flux across the measurements (around 30\%), but this is suggested to be due to differences in the individual coronal holes rather than a feature of the solar cycle. Our direct estimates are in agreement with recent studies by \cite{Huang_2023,Huang2024} who constrain the vertical Poynting flux through comparison of predicted wind properties from Alfvénic wave driven turbulence models to those observed with OMNI at 1~AU. Taken together, both sets of results points towards a lack of correlation between the coronal Poynting flux from waves and the solar cycle.","['Richard J. Morton', 'Micah J. Weberg', 'N.

On the Gauge Invariance of Secondary Gravitational Waves,"Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.","['Chen Yuan', 'Yizhou Lu', 'Zu-Cheng Chen', 'Lang Liu']",0.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13691,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-24
Micro-Tidal Disruption Events at Galactic Centers,"In this work, we discuss a scenario of a micro-Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) associated with high-speed white dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. It happens at galactic centers, where a white dwarf orbiting around the massive black hole scatters with a stellar-mass black hole in its early extreme mass-ratio inspiral stage. We estimate the formation rate, perform a series of hydro simulations to investigate the amount of accreted and unbound mass as a function of impact radius and speed, and discuss the main EM signatures: an X-ray flare (micro-TDE) followed by a relatively faint (TDE-type) optical flare. The properties of some of the transient X-ray bursts found by Einstein Probe are consistent with the micro-TDE scenario considered here.","['Xinyu Li', 'Houyi Sun', 'Yuan-Chuan Zou', 'Huan Yang']",11.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13702,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-24
The vertical shear instability in protoplanetary discs as an outwardly travelling wave. I. Linear theory,"We revisit the global linear theory of the vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary discs with an imposed radial temperature gradient. We focus on the regime in which the VSI has the form of a travelling inertial wave that grows in amplitude as it propagates outwards. Building on previous work describing travelling waves in thin astrophysical discs, we develop a quantitative theory of the wave motion, its spatial structure and the physical mechanism by which the wave is amplified. We find that this viewpoint provides a useful description of the large-scale development of the VSI in global numerical simulations, which involves corrugation and breathing motions of the disc. We contrast this behaviour with that of perturbations of smaller scale, in which the VSI grows into a nonlinear regime in place without significant radial propagation.","['Gordon I.

ATLASGAL-selected high-mass clumps in the inner Galaxy: XI. Morphology and kinematics of warm inner envelopes,"(Abridged) Massive stellar embryos are embedded in warm envelopes that provide mass reservoirs for the accretion process onto final stars. Feedback from star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the envelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation processes. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics of the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star formation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$ $^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80"" x 80"" towards 99 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological complexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for simple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared to small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of envelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all stages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole sample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution, and the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial distributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by power-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many sources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common among the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales suggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes is complex and unclear for many sources.","['Thanh Dat Hoang', 'Min-Young Lee', 'Friedrich Wyrowski', 'Agata Karska', 'Felipe Navarete', 'Karl M.

Considerations on the Origin of IRAS 19312+1950 Based on Long-Term Maser Observations,"IRAS source 19312+1950 (hereafter I19312) is an infrared point source with maser emissions of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH molecules. Although initial observations suggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not fully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further investigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its maser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical objects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH maser emissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared with historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer the possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were detected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability. The OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H$_2$O maser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312 could be a candidate for a Water Fountain (WF) star, though there are inconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this hypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a Red Nova Remnant (RNR) is also considered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence. The evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple characteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs. Further long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations are required to better constrain the nature of this object.","['Huan-Xue Feng', 'Jun-ichi Nakashima', 'D. Engels', 'S.

Can $\nu$DM interactions solve the $S_8$ discrepancy?,"We present compelling evidence that Dark Matter (DM)-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing (WL) surveys and leveraging an emulator based on true $N$-body simulations to account for nonlinear corrections, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with DES Y3 cosmic shear data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ detection of non-zero DM-neutrino interactions, marking a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of dark matter.","['Lei Zu', 'William Giarè', 'Chi Zhang', 'Eleonora Di Valentino', 'Yue-Lin Sming Tsai', 'Sebastian Trojanowski']",10.0,28.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13785,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-24
Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra,"The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.","['Gabriele Montefalcone', 'Benjamin Wallisch', 'Katherine Freese']",14.0,50.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13788,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-24
Exoplanet Occurrence Rate with Age for FGK Stars in Kepler,"We measure exoplanet occurrence rate as a function of isochrone and gyrochronology ages using confirmed and candidate planets identified in Q1-17 DR25 Kepler data. We employ Kepler's pipeline detection efficiency to correct for the expected number of planets in each age bin. We examine the occurrence rates for planets with radii $0.2 \leq Rp \leq 20$ R$_\oplus$ and orbital periods $0.2 \leq P \leq 100$ days for FGK stars with ages between $1.5-8$ Gyr using the inverse detection efficiency method. We find no significant trend between occurrence rate and stellar ages; a slight, decreasing trend (within $1.5-2.5$ $\sigma$) only emerges for low-mass and metal-rich stars that dominate our sample. We isolate the effects of mass and metallicity on the occurrence rate trend with age, but find the results to be inconclusive due to weak trends and small sample size. Our results hint that the exoplanet occurrence rate may decrease over time due to dynamical instability from planet-planet scattering or planet ejection, but accurate ages and larger sample sizes are needed to resolve a clear relation between occurrence rate and age.","['Maryum Sayeed', 'Ruth Angus', 'Travis Berger', 'Yuxi', 'Jessie Christiansen', 'Daniel Foreman-Mackey', 'Melissa Ness']",5.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13809,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['Exoplanet astronomy (486) — exoplanet dynamics (490) — exoplanet evolution (491) 1'],2025-01-24
"Inflaton Self Resonance, Oscillons, and Gravitational Waves in Small Field Polynomial Inflation","In this work, we investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of a simple single-field model with a renormalizable inflaton potential featuring a near-inflection point at a field value $\phi_0$. Due to the concave shape of the scalar potential, the effective mass of the inflaton becomes imaginary during as well as for some period after slow-roll inflation. As a result, in the initial reheating phase, where the inflaton oscillates around its minimum with a large amplitude, some field fluctuations grow exponentially; this effect becomes stronger at smaller $\phi_0$. This aspect can be analyzed using the Floquet theorem. We also analytically estimate the backreaction time after which the perturbations affect the evolution of the average inflaton field. In order to fully analyze this non-perturbative regime, we perform a (classical) lattice simulation, which reveals that the exponential growth of field fluctuations can fragment the system. This leads to a large amount of non-Gaussianity at very small scales, but the equation of state remains close to matter-like. The evolution of the background field throughout the fragmentation phase can be understood using the Hartree approximation. For sufficiently small $\phi_0$ soliton-like objects, called oscillons in the literature, are formed. This leads to areas with high local over-density, $\delta \rho \gg \bar\rho$ where $\bar\rho$ is the average energy density. We speculate that this could lead to the formation of light primordial black holes, with lifetime $\gtrsim 10^{-19} \text{sec}$. Other possibly observational consequences, in particular gravitational waves in the $\text{MHz} - \text{GHz}$ range, are discussed as well. Although a complete analytical study is difficult in our case, we obtain a power law scaling for the potential observables on $\phi_0$.","['Manuel Drees', 'Chenhuan Wang']",20.0,34.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13811,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-24
Cold dark gas in Cygnus X: The first large-scale mapping of low-frequency carbon recombination lines,"Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2. The typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we estimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line profiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of FWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within 10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce that the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha gas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have emerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly related (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits independently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise from the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter, C273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.","['Kimberly L.

A Study on the Line of Sight to Galaxies Detected at Gamma-ray Energies,"The large-scale Universal structure comprises strands of dark matter and galaxies with large under-dense volumes known as voids. We measure the fraction of the line of sight that intersects voids for active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This ``voidiness'' fraction is a rudimentary proxy for the density along the line of sight to the galaxies. The voidiness of SDSS-observed quasars (QSOs) is distinctly different from randomly distributed source populations, with a median p-value of $4.6\times10^{-5}$ and $\ll 1\times10^{-7}$, when compared with 500 simulated populations with randomly simulated locations but matching redshifts in the $0.1\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z < 0.7$ intervals, respectively. A similar comparison of the voidiness for LAT-detected AGN shows median p-values greater than 0.05 in each redshift interval. When comparing the SDSS QSO population to the LAT-detected AGN, we mitigate potential bias from a relationship between redshift and voidiness by comparing the LAT-detected AGN to a ``redshift-matched'' set of SDSS QSOs. The LAT-detected AGN between a redshift of 0.4 and 0.7 show higher voidiness compared to the redshift-matched SDSS QSO populations, with a median p-value of 2.3$\times10^{-5}$, (a $4.1\sigma$ deviation). No deviation is found when comparing the same populations between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.4 (p>0.05). We do not study possible causes of this voidiness difference. It might relate to propagation effects from lower magnetic or radiative background fields within voids or to an environment more favorable for gamma-ray production for AGN near voids.","['Amy Furniss', 'Josepf N.

Exploring Various Dark Matter Halo Profiles in Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies within the Framework of Standard Cosmology,"In this paper, we study the rotation curves of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31) by considering its bulge, disk, and halo components. We model the bulge region by the widely accepted de Vaucouleur's law and the disk region by the well established exponential profile. In order to understand the distribution of dark matter in the halo region, we consider three different dark matter profiles in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model namely, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Hernquist and Einasto profiles. We use recent datasets of rotation curves of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy. The data consist of rotation velocities of the stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of the radial distance from the center. Using Bayesian statistics, we perform an overall fit including all the components, i.e., bulge, disk and halo with the data. Our results indicate that the NFW and Hernquist profiles are in concordance with the observational data points.

Dust characterization of protoplanetary disks: a guide to multi-wavelength analyses and accurate dust mass measurements,"Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm $\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03""-0.05"") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However, lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of magnitude.","['Elena M.

The Pitfalls of Using Lyman Alpha Damping Wings in High-z Galaxy Spectra to Measure the Intergalactic Neutral Hydrogen Fraction,"The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the ""true"" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly{\alpha} emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly{\alpha} damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.","['Mason Huberty', 'Claudia Scarlata', 'Matthew J.

These anisotropies serve as a powerful probe of fundamental physics while also revealing astrophysical processes governing the thermodynamics and distribution of baryonic matter. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the physical mechanisms underlying secondary anisotropies, their observational status, and their potential to advance precision cosmology.

HD 206893 B at High Spectral Resolution with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC),"We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $>8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $>4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.","['Ben Sappey', 'Quinn Konopacky', 'Clarissa R.

Testing tidal theory using Gaia binaries: the red giant branch,"Tidal interaction is a major ingredient in the theory of binary evolution. Here, we study tidal circularization in binaries with red giant primaries. We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of $\sim30,000$ red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about $3-4$ times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.","['Janosz W.

HP2 Survey V. Ophiuchus: Filament formation in a dispersing cloud complex,"We search for potential ``birthmarks'' left from the formation of filamentary molecular clouds in the Ophiuchus complex. We use high dynamic-range column density and temperature maps derived from \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck}, and \textit{2MASS/NICEST} extinction data. We find two distinct types of filaments based on their orientation relative to nearby massive stars: radial (R-type) and tangential (T-type). R-type filaments exhibit decreasing mass profiles away from massive stars, while T-type filaments show flat but structured profiles. We propose a scenario where both filament types originate from the dynamic interplay of compression and stretching forces exerted by a fast outflow emanating from the OB association. The two formation mechanisms leave distinct observable ``birthmarks'' (namely, filament orientation, mass distribution, and star formation location) on each filament type. Our results illustrate a complex phase in molecular cloud evolution with two simultaneous yet contrasting processes: the formation of filaments and stars via the dispersal of residual gas from a previous massive star formation event. Our approach highlights the importance of taking into account the wider context of a star-forming complex, rather than concentrating exclusively on particular subregions.","['João Alves', 'Marco Lombardi', 'Charles Lada']",11.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13931,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A),"A&A 662, A114 (2022)","['dust', 'extinction', 'ISM: structure', 'ISM: clouds', 'Lupus', 'ISM: individual objects: Ophiuchus', 'Pipe Nebula molecular cloud 1']",2025-01-24
A theoretical framework for BL Her stars IV. New period-luminosity relations in the Rubin-LSST filters,"We present new theoretical light curves in the Rubin-LSST filters for a fine grid of BL Her models computed using MESA-RSP. We also derive new theoretical period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations in the Rubin-LSST filters with the goal to study the effect of convection parameters and metallicity on these relations. The grid of BL Her models was computed with the input stellar parameters: metallicity ($-2.0\; \mathrm{dex} \leq \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.0\; \mathrm{dex}$), stellar mass ($0.5M_{\odot}-0.8M_{\odot}$), stellar luminosity ($50L_{\odot}-300L_{\odot}$), and effective temperature (across the full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K) and using four sets of convection parameters. Bolometric correction tables from MIST were used to transform the theoretical bolometric light curves of the BL Her models into the Rubin-LSST ugrizy filters. The PL relations of the BL Her models exhibit steeper slopes but smaller dispersion with increasing wavelengths in the Rubin-LSST filters. The PL and PW slopes for the complete set of BL Her models computed with radiative cooling (sets B and D) are statistically similar across the grizy filters. The BL Her models exhibit weak or negligible effect of metallicity on the PL relations for wavelengths longer than the g filter for both the cases of the complete set of models as well as the low-mass models. However, we find significant effect of metallicity on the PL relation in the u filter. Strong metallicity effects are observed in the PWZ relations involving the u filter and are found to have significant contribution from the high-metallicity BL Her models. Due to negligible metallicity effect for relations involving the Wesenheit indices $W(i,g-i)$, $W(z,i-z)$ and $W(y,g-y)$, we recommend these filter combinations for BL Her stars when observed with the Rubin-LSST to be used as reliable standard candles.","['Susmita Das', 'László Molnár', 'Róbert Szabó', 'Harinder P.

Highly reflective white clouds on the western dayside of an exo-Neptune,"Highly-irradiated gas giant exoplanets are predicted to show circulation patterns dominated by day-to-night heat transport and a spatial distribution of clouds that is driven by advection and local heating. Hot-Jupiters have been extensively studied from broadband phase-curve observations at infrared and optical wavelengths, but spectroscopic observations in the reflected light are rare and the regime of smaller and higher-metallicity ultra-hot planets, such as hot-Neptunes, remains largely unexplored to date. Here we present the phase-resolved reflected-light and thermal-emission spectroscopy of the ultra-hot Neptune LTT 9779b, obtained through observing its full phase-curve from 0.6 to 2.8 $\mu$m with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. We detect an asymmetric dayside in reflected light (3.1$\sigma$ significance) with highly-reflective white clouds on the western dayside (A = 0.79$\pm$0.15) and a much lower-albedo eastern dayside (A = 0.41$\pm$0.10), resulting in an overall dayside albedo of A = 0.50$\pm$0.07. The thermal phase curve is symmetric about the substellar point, with a dayside effective temperature of T$_\mathrm{eff,day}$ = 2,260$^{+40}_{-50}$ K and a cold nightside (T$_\mathrm{eff,night}$ <1,330 K at 3-$\sigma$ confidence), indicative of short radiative timescales. We propose an atmospheric circulation and cloud distribution regime in which heat is transported eastward from the dayside towards the cold nightside by an equatorial jet, leading to a colder western dayside where temperatures are sufficiently low for the condensation of silicate clouds.","['Louis-Philippe Coulombe', 'Michael Radica', 'Björn Benneke', ""Élyse D'Aoust"", 'Lisa Dang', 'Nicolas B.

The Three Hundred Project hydrodynamical simulations: Hydrodynamical Weak-Lensing Cluster Mass Biases and Richnesses using different hydro models,"The mass of galaxy clusters derived from weak-lensing observations is sensitive to projection effects, and, on average, it is biased low with respect to the true cluster mass, with a mass and redshift dependence. In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters carried out with GadgetX and GIZMO-SIMBA as part of the Three Hundred Project. We use them to quantify weak-lensing mass biases with respect also to the results from dark matter-only simulations. We also investigate how the biases of the weak-lensing mass estimates propagate into the richness-mass relation. Future wide-field weak-lensing surveys require per cent accuracy on the characterisation of cluster masses in order to use galaxy cluster number count and clustering as complementary probes for cosmological analyses. We aim to shed light on the effect of the presence of baryons on the weak-lensing mass bias and also whether this bias depends on the galaxy formation recipe; in addition, we seek to model the richness-mass relation that can be used as guidelines for observational experiments for cluster cosmology. We produce weak-lensing simulations of random projections to model the expected excess surface mass density profile of clusters up to redshift $z=1$. We derive the weak-lensing mass-richness relation and find consistency within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties across hydrodynamical simulations. The scatter in observed richness at a fixed weak-lensing mass, or vice versa, increases linearly with redshift at a fixed stellar mass cut. Importantly, we observe that the scatter in richness at a given true mass is smaller than at a given weak-lensing mass. Our results align well with SDSS redMaPPer cluster observations.

The rate of extreme coronal line emitters in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample,"Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift $\sim0.3$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift $\sim0.3$ to be $R_\mathrm{G}=1.6~^{+3.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the mass-normalized rate to be $R_\mathrm{M}=7~^{+16}_{-6}\times10^{-18}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is then converted to a volumetric rate of $R_\mathrm{V}=1.8~^{+4.5}_{-1.5}\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are $2-4$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift $\sim0.1$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at $1\sigma$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by $5-20$ per cent of all TDEs.","['Joseph Callow', 'Or Graur', 'Peter Clark', 'Alex G.

Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries,"The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.","['Cheyanne Shariat', 'Kareem El-Badry', 'Smadar Naoz', 'Antonio C.

"Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions","We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} > 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 < W4 < 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r > 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 >8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z>2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z>2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.","['Ben Wang', 'Joseph F.

The observed phase space of mass-loss history from massive stars based on radio observations of a large supernova sample,"In this work we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only $\sim 22 \%$ of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass-loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the SN-CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of a SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-non-detected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of $2 \times 10^{-6} - 10^{-4} \, \rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ for different epochs during the last 1000 years before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of $10 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$) for the progenitors of $\sim 80\%$ of the type II SNe in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for $\sim 50 \%$ of the progenitors of type II SNe in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass-loss in winds from a statistical point of view.","['Itai Sfaradi', 'Assaf Horesh', 'Rob Fender', 'Lauren Rhodes', 'Joe Bright', 'David Williams-Baldwin', 'Dave A.

Interacting galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations -- VIII: Pericentric star formation rate enhancements are driven both by increased fuelling and efficiency,"Using the TNG100-1 cosmological simulations, we explore how galaxy properties, such as specific star formation rate ($\rm sSFR=SFR/M_*$), gas fraction ($\rm f_{gas} \,= \, M_{\rm H}/M_{*}$), and star formation efficiency ($\rm SFE_{H} = SFR/M_{H}$), change over the course of galaxy-galaxy interactions. We identify 18,534 distinct encounters from the reconstructed orbits of a sample of massive galaxies ($\rm M_{*} > 10^{10} \; \rm M_{\odot}$) with companions within a stellar mass ratio of 0.1 to 10. Using these encounters, we study the variation of galaxy properties over time as they approach and move away from pericentric encounters over a redshift range of $0 \leq z < 1$. Following the closest pericentric encounters ($\leq 50$ kpc) of a host galaxy with its companion, we find that sSFR is enhanced by a factor of $1.6 \pm 0.1$ on average within the central stellar half-mass radius (R\textsubscript{1/2}) compared to pre-encounter values. Our results show a time delay between pericentre and maximum sSFR enhancement of $\sim$0.1 Gyr with a mean galaxy separation of 75 kpc. We similarly find that $\rm f_{gas}$ is enhanced by a factor of $1.2 \pm 0.1$, and $\rm SFE_{H}$ is enhanced by a factor of $1.4 \pm 0.1$ following the pericentre of an encounter within the same timescale. Additionally, we find evidence of inflowing gas towards the centre, measured by comparing the $\rm f_{gas}$ and metallicity within the central R\textsubscript{1/2} to the galactic outskirts. We find that approximately 70 per cent of the peak sSFR enhancement can be attributed to the increase in $\rm SFE_{H}$, with the increase in $\rm f_{gas}$ contributing the remaining 30 per cent.","['Lawrence Faria', 'David R.

Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone,"Several ground- and space-based searches have increased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000. While most are highly unlike our planet, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide the most intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As the detections increase, it is critical to probe the HZ as well as its limits empirically using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to probe the limits of surface habitability. We analyze all known exoplanets and identify 67 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 38 in a narrower 3D-model HZ. We compare their demographics with the full catalog of exoplanets, analyze their characteristics, give HZ limits for each system, and prioritize targets for observation. We address another critical dimension to this exploration and compile missing stellar age estimates for these candidates.To probe the limits of habitability, we identify several transiting and non-transiting rocky planets that can provide constraints on the inner and outer edge of the HZ, explore how eccentricity influences habitability, and identify the oldest HZ worlds as well as exoplanets with similar flux to modern Earth's. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize their search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and LIFE -- and to design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these intriguing worlds, addressing the question of the limits of surface habitability on exoplanets.","['Abigail Bohl', 'Lucas Lawrence', 'Gillis Lowry', 'Lisa Kaltenegger']",6.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14054,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",,,['exoplanets - astrobiology - astronomical databases: catalogues - planets and satellites: terrestrial planets - (stars:) planetary systems 1 INTRODUCTION Severalsuccessfulground-andspace-basedsearcheshaveincreased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000 (NASA Exoplanet Archive 2024)'],2025-01-27

Early r-process Enrichment and Hierarchical Assembly Across the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy,"Dwarf galaxies like Sagittarius (Sgr) provide a unique window into the early stages of galactic chemical evolution, particularly through their metal-poor stars. By studying the chemical abundances of stars in the Sgr core and tidal streams, we can gain insights into the assembly history of this galaxy and its early heavy element nucleosynthesis processes. We efficiently selected extremely metal-poor candidates in the core and streams for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using metallicity-sensitive photometry from SkyMapper DR2, and Gaia DR3 XP spectra and proper motions. This allowed us to obtain a high-purity selection of Sgr members based on stellar kinematics while reducing the chances of potential contamination from the Milky Way halo. We present a sample of 37 Sgr stars with detailed chemical abundances, of which we identify 10 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\rm{[Fe/H]} \le -3.0$) stars, 25 very metal-poor (VMP; $\rm{[Fe/H]} \le -2.0$) stars, and 2 metal-poor (MP; $\rm{[Fe/H]} \le -1.0$) stars. This sample increases the number of extremely metal-poor Sgr stars analyzed with high-resolution spectroscopy by a factor of five. Of these stars, 15 are identified as members of the Sgr tidal stream, while the remaining 22 are associated with the core. We derive abundances for up to 20 elements and identify no statistically significant differences between the element abundance patterns across the core and stream samples. Intriguingly, we identify stars that may have formed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that accreted onto Sgr, in addition to patterns of C and r-process elements distinct from the Milky Way halo. Over half of the sample shows a neutron-capture element abundance pattern consistent with the scaled solar pure r-process pattern, indicating early r-process enrichment in the Sgr progenitor.","['Xiaowei Ou', 'Alexander Yelland', 'Anirudh Chiti', 'Anna Frebel', 'Guilherme Limberg', 'Mohammad K.

You Shall Not Pass! The propagation of low/moderate powered jets through a turbulent interstellar medium,"Feedback from black hole-powered jets has been invoked in many cosmological simulations to regulate star formation and quench galaxies. Despite this, observational evidence of how jets might be able to affect their hosts remains scarce, especially for low power jets in halos smaller than clusters. Recent observations of outflows around FR0 galaxies, that host compact radio-loud sources, imply that lower-power jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) may have a significant impact on their hosts through jet interactions with the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the Arepo code, we launch jets of low and intermediate power (10$^{38}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) within a ~kpc-scale periodic box with driven turbulence to study how the jets propagate through a turbulent ISM. Our simulation results broadly fit into three different scenarios $\unicode{x2013}$ jets penetrating easily through the ISM, becoming completely stalled, or the interesting intermediate stage, when jets are highly disturbed and redirected. We suggest that intermediate power jets do not have enough ram pressure to affect the turbulent structure of the ISM, and so only fill pre-existing cavities. Low-power jets are able to drive outflows in a hot phase ($>10^{4.4}$ K). However, warm (~$10^4$ K) ionized gas outflows appear under certain conditions.

These can be used to study the intergalactic medium (IGM) thanks to their dispersion measure (DM). The DM has several contributions that can be measured (or estimated), including the contribution from the host galaxy itself, DM_host. In this work, we empirically estimate DM_host for a sample of 12 galaxy hosts, using a direct method based solely on the properties of the host galaxies themselves (DM_host_dir). We use VLT/MUSE observations of the FRB hosts for estimating DM_host_dir. The method relies on estimating the DM contribution of both the FRB host galaxy's interstellar medium and its halo separately. For comparison purposes, we also provide an alternative indirect method to estimate DM_host based on the Macquart relation (DM_host_mq). We find an average <DM_host> = 80+/-11 pc/cc with a standard deviation of 38 pc/cc (in the rest-frame) based on our direct method, with a systematic uncertainty of 30%. We report positive correlations between DM_host and both the stellar masses and the star-formation rates of their host galaxies. In contrast, we do not find any strong correlation between DM_host and neither redshift nor the projected distances to the FRB hosts centers. Finally, we do not find any strong correlation between DM_host_dir and DM_host_mq, although their average values are consistent. Our reported correlations could be used to improve the priors used in establishing DM_host for individual FRBs. Similarly, such correlations and the lack of a strong redshift evolution can be used to constrain models for the progenitor of FRBs. However, the lack of a DM_host_dir and DM_host_mq correlation indicates that there may still be contributions to the DM of FRBs not included in our modeling, e.g. large DMs from the FRB progenitor and/or intervening large-scale structures not accounted for in DM_host_mq.","['Lucas Bernales--Cortes', 'Nicolas Tejos', 'J.

Estimating Black Hole Masses in Obscured AGN from X-ray and Optical Emission Line Luminosities,"We test a novel method for estimating black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) that uses proxies to measure the full-width half maximum of broad H$\alpha$ (FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$) and the accretion disk luminosity at 5100 Angstrom ($\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$). Using a published correlation, we estimate FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ from the narrow optical emission line ratio $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$. Using a sample of 99 local obscured AGN from the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, we assess the agreement between estimating $\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$ from the intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and from narrow optical emission lines. We find a mean offset of $0.32 \pm 0.68$ dex between these methods, which propagates to a factor of $\sim$2 uncertainty when estimating $M_{\rm BH}$ using a virial mass formula where $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$ serves as a proxy of FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$). We compare $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ with virial $M_{\rm BH}$ measurements from broad Paschen emission lines. For the 14 (12) BASS AGN with broad Pa$\alpha$ (Pa$\beta$) detections, we find $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to be systematically higher than $M_{\rm BH,Pa\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,Pa\beta}$) by a factor of 0.39 $\pm$ 0.44 dex (0.48 $\pm$ 0.51 dex). Since these offsets are within the scatter, more data are needed to assess whether $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ is biased high. For 151 BASS AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm *}$), we find that the $\sigma_{\rm *}$-derived $M_{\rm BH}$ agrees with $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to within 0.08 dex, albeit with wide scatter (0.74 dex). The method tested here can provide estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ in thousands of obscured AGN in spectroscopic surveys when other diagnostics are not available, though with an uncertainty of $\sim$3-5.","['S.

An orphan flare from a plasma blob crossing the broad-line region ?,"The blazar 3C 279 is well known for its prolific emission of rapid flares. A particular event occurred on 12/20/2013, exhibiting a large flux increase with a doubling time scale of a few hours, a very hard gamma-ray spectrum, and a time-asymmetric light curve with slow decay, but no significant variations detected in the optical range. We propose a novel scenario to interpret this flare, based on two emission zones, a stationary blob and a moving plasma blob. The stationary blob, located within the BLR, accounts for the low-state emission. The moving blob decouples from the stationary zone, accelerates and crosses the BLR. The high-energy flare is attributed to the variable external Compton emission as the blob moves through the BLR, while variations in the synchrotron emission are negligible. Our interpretation differs from previous interpretations by attributing the flare to the bulk motion and geometry of the external photon fields, without invoking varying electron injection.","['Sébastien Le Bihan', 'Anton Dmytriiev', 'Andreas Zech']",4.0,5.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14074,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['relativistic jets', 'blazars', 'non-thermal emission', '3C 279', 'Active Galactic Nuclei']",2025-01-27
Global Distribution of Serpentine on Mars,"The distribution and origin of serpentine on Mars can provide insights into the planet's aqueous history, habitability, and past climate. In this study, we used dynamic aperture factor analysis/target transformation applied to 15,760 images from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, followed by validation with the radiance ratio method, to construct a map of Mg-serpentine deposits on Mars. Although relatively rare, Mg-serpentine was detected in diverse geomorphic settings across Noachian and Hesperian-aged terrains in the southern highlands of Mars, implying that serpentinization was active on early Mars and that multiple formation mechanisms may be needed to explain its spatial distribution. We also calculated the amount of H2 produced during the formation of the observed deposits and conclude that serpentinization was likely more widespread on Mars than indicated by the observed distribution.","['A.

Discovery of A Starburst in the Early Milky Way at [Fe/H] $< -2$,"We present an analysis of very metal-poor (VMP) and metal-poor stars ($-3.0 < \mathrm{Fe/H]} < -1.5$) in the Gaia BP/RP or XP catalog, which reveals two distinct metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) in regions of the Galactic disk above and below $|z| = 1.0$ kpc. The low-$|z|$ regions display a metallicity peak around [Fe/H] = -2.0 with a sharp transition in Galactocentric azimuthal velocity ($v_\phi$), a feature notably absent in high-$|z|$ regions. Using a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model, we found that the proto-Milky Way underwent two distinct formation scenarios: a rapid star formation burst followed by quenching near the Galactic center and an extended period of steady star formation. This starburst could have been triggered by a gas-rich accretion event in the first Gyr of our Galaxy's history. Comparison with Milky Way-analog galaxies in Auriga simulations shows strong agreement in the characteristics of this starburst population. During the accretion event, gas rapidly sinks into the inner regions of these analog galaxies, producing the observed MDF peak and the low $v_\phi$ values. The simulations further indicate that most stars at the metallicity peak formed in situ, rather than through accretion. These findings identify this starburst population as the long-sought in situ component of the proto-Galaxy.","['Boquan Chen', 'Matthew Orkney', 'Yuan-Sen Ting', 'Michael Hayden']",8.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14089,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,the Open Journal of Astrophysics,,['keyword1 – keyword2 – keyword3 1'],2025-01-27
JWST 1.5 {\mu}m and 4.8 {\mu}m Photometry of Y Dwarfs,"Brown dwarfs lack nuclear fusion and cool with time; the coldest known have an effective temperature below 500 K, and are known as Y dwarfs. We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three were imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M filters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs. F150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs with F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al. (2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the near-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$ F480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of the Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue, consistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M filter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the object suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved photometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find that the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer, possibly suggesting the presence of water clouds.

Electromagnetic Follow-up to Gravitational Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX),"The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.","['Alexander W.

Study of the gamma-Ray Radiation Properties of High-redshift Blazars at z>2.5,"We study a sample of 30 high-redshift blazars ($z>2.5$) by means of spectra and the radiation mechanism with Fermi Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray observations spanning 15 years. Three models -- the power law, power law with an exponential cutoff, and log-parabola -- are employed to analyze the spectral properties, and most sources exhibit significant curvature. The high-redshift blazars exhibit higher $\gamma$-ray luminosities and softer spectral indices compared with their low-redshift counterparts, where B3~1343+451 has the highest integrated flux, $\rm 1.13 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{\ ph \ cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. We use a standard one-zone leptonic emission model to reproduce the spectral energy distributions of 23 sources with multiwavelength observations. We find that modeling with infrared seed photons is systematically better than with broad-line region (BLR) photons based on a $\chi^2$ test, which suggests that the $\gamma$-ray-emitting regions are most likely located outside the BLR. The fit results show that high-redshift blazars exhibit higher energy density, jet power, kinetic power, and accretion disk luminosities, along with lower synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) peak frequencies, relative to their lower-redshift counterparts. We find that blazars with higher accretion disk luminosities tend to have lower IC peak frequencies, leading to more efficient cooling of high-energy electrons. The positive correlation between jet power and accretion disk luminosity further supports the possibility of an accretion-jet connection in these high-redshift sources.","['Fan Wu', 'Benzhong Dai']",12.0,20.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14137,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,['galaxies: active — gamma rays: galaxies — radiation mechanism: non-thermal — galaxies: jets 1'],2025-01-27
Resolution requirements for numerical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics,"Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.","['Hiroki Nagakura', 'Masamichi Zaizen', 'Jiabao Liu', 'Lucas Johns']",10.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14145,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-27
The Southern Twenty-centimetre All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS): survey description and maps,"We present data processing and verification of the Southern Twenty-centimetre All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS) conducted with Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m telescope. The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range of 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with the S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long azimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the data processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in both flux density scale (Jy/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale (K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The temperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) high-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common resolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8 mK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to 1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum at declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and RM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole STAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact sources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel temperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of extragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of the flux density scale is less than 10%. STAPS delivers an L-band (20 cm) multi-frequency polarization view of the Galaxy, and will help advance our understanding of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetized interstellar medium.","['Xiaohui Sun', 'Marijke Haverkorn', 'Ettore Carretti', 'Tom Landecker', 'B.

Discovery of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short-duration gamma-ray bursts,"Rapidly rotating newborn magnetars, which originate from binary neutron star (NS) mergers and serve as the central engines of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may leave some imprints on their prompt gamma-ray lightcurves even though they are far from their radiating fireballs. A high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) would be a unique feature for the magnetar central engine, especially a hypermassive magnetar. By conducting a systematic analysis of the prompt gamma-ray lightcurves from 605 short GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM, we have identified such QPO signals in three GRBs (e.g., GRB 120323A, GRB 181222B, and GRB 190606A). The QPOs that peaked at $1258^{+6}_{-6}$ Hz for GRB 120323A, $623^{+4}_{-4}$ Hz for GRB 181222B, and $1410^{+4}_{-5}$ Hz for GRB 190606A are all with a confidence level above 5.2 $\sigma$. The high-frequency QPO signals of those three short GRBs may be caused by a hypermassive magnetar acting as the central engine in a binary neutron star merger of binary neutron star.","['Xing Yang', 'Hou-Jun Lü', 'Jared Rice', 'En-Wei Liang']",7.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14207,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Gamma-ray burst: general 1 INTRODUCTION Since the discovery of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in 1963', 'several linesofobservationalevidencesuggestthattheprogenitorsofshort- duration GRBs (Kumar & Zhang 2015) or nearby short-duration GRBs with extended emission (Rastinejad et al']",2025-01-27
The disrupting and growing open cluster spiral arm patterns of the Milky Way,"Star clusters provide unique advantages for investigating Galactic spiral arms, particularly due to their precise ages, positions, and kinematic properties, which are further enhanced by ongoing updates from the astrometric data. In this study, we employ the latest extensive catalogue of open clusters from Gaia DR3 to examine the positional deviations of clusters belonging to different age groups. Additionally, we employ dynamical simulations to probe the evolutionary behavior of spiral arm positions. Our analysis reveals an absence of a theoretical age pattern in the spiral arms traced by open clusters, and the pattern speeds of the spiral arms are consistent with the rotation curve. Both of these results do not align with the predictions of quasi-stationary density wave theory, suggesting a more dynamic or transient arm scenario for the Milky Way. From this perspective, combined with vertex deviation estimates, it appears that the Local arm is in a state of growth. In contrast, the Sagittarius-Carina arm and the Perseus arm exhibit opposing trends. Consequently, we speculate that the Galactic stellar disk does not exhibit a grand-design spiral pattern with a fixed pattern speed, but rather manifests as a multi-armed structure with arms that continuously emerge and dissipate.","['Xiaochen Liu', 'Zhihong He', 'Yangping Luo', 'Kun Wang']",4.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14215,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,MNRAS,,['Galaxy – Spiral arm – Open cluster 1 INTRODUCTION Spiral arms are the typical morphological features of spiral galaxies andserveastheprimarysitesforstarformationwithinthesegalaxies'],2025-01-27
Orbital Dynamics of Atlas (S XV): Its Current Orbit and the Recent Past,"This study comprehensively analyzes Atlas's current orbit, focusing on the secular and resonant perturbations caused by Prometheus, Pandora, and Saturn's oblateness. We performed numerical integration of the exact equations of motion for a dense ensemble of Atlas clone satellites. Through spectral analysis and interpretation of these orbits on dynamical maps, we identified the domain of the 54:53 Prometheus-Atlas and 70:67 Pandora-Atlas mean-motion resonances, showing that Atlas lies on the boundary of the separatrices of each of these resonances. We also identified the domains for the multiplets $\Psi_{1}$, $\Psi_{2}$, $\Psi_{3}$ and $\Psi_{4}$ associated with 70:67 resonance. Additionally, we explored the variation in Prometheus's eccentricity, demonstrating that as eccentricity increases (or decreases) in the 54:53 resonance domain correspondingly decreases (or increases). This combined analysis, between the above mappings, revealed qualitatively the overlap between the 54:53 and 70:67 resonances, which are responsible for the chaotic behavior of Atlas's orbit. We quantified chaotic motion in frequency space and found that the vicinity of Atlas is characterized by weak to moderate chaos, rather than strong chaos. Finally, we investigated Atlas's recent past, considering Prometheus's migration under the influence of Saturn's tidal forces. This analysis reveals several resonances crossed in the past, particularly focusing on the Atlas-Prometheus pair, which exhibited a co-orbital configuration.","['Demétrio Tadeu Ceccatto', 'Nelson Callegari Jr', 'Gabriel Teixeira Guimarães', 'Karyna Gimenez']",16.0,29.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14245,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Chaotic Dynamics'],,"Volume 255, January 2025, 106016","['Dynamics of natural satellites', 'Prometheus', 'chaotic di ffusion 1', 'Pandora', 'Atlas', 'mean-motion resonances']",2025-01-27
A flaring radio counterpart to a fast radio burst reveals a newborn magnetized engine,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic millisecond radio bursts at cosmological distances, whose underlying engine is not identified. Among a sub-population that emit repeated radio bursts, a handful were associated with a persistent radio source (PRS) whose origin is unknown. Here we report the discovery of a compact flaring radio source (FRS) associated with a newly-active repeating FRB within one month after the first radio burst was detected. Its temporal and spectral characteristics differ from those of the PRSs but are similar to those of engine-powered supernovae and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We detected a spectral peak around $1.6\pm0.2$ GHz that is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption. Assuming equipartition, the magnetic field strength in the FRS is larger than the line-of-sight component constrained from the FRB Faraday rotation, suggesting a highly magnetized engine. The radius of the FRS is constrained to be $\sim0.03$ pc and the minimum total energy is $\sim~6.2\times{10}^{47}~{\rm ergs~}$. This FRS reveals the birth of a highly magnetized FRB engine, and hints that PRSs associated with other active FRBs may be in the later stage of evolution.","['Xian Zhang', 'Wenfei Yu', 'Zhen Yan', 'Yi Xing', 'Bing Zhang']",14.0,37.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14247,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-27
Deciphering the spectral bumps of Galactic cosmic rays through gamma-ray observations of nearby molecular clouds,"The observed spectral bump in cosmic-ray (CR) proton and helium spectra, along with the phase and amplitude evolution of CR dipole anisotropy, provide plausible yet indirect evidence for the presence of a nearby CR source. This study investigates the potential of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) located near the solar system to act as natural probes of CRs from the nearby source, with their gamma-ray emissions serving as indicators of spatial variations in CR flux within the solar neighborhood resulting from this source. We show that a nearby source, accounting for the CR data, could imprint distinct features on the $\gamma$-ray spectra of different GMCs. We expect that these features are detectable by LHAASO and upcoming high-energy $\gamma$-ray observatories, providing a powerful test for the hypothesized nearby source. Notably, we find that determining the energy dependence of the $\gamma$-ray spectral index offers a promising approach to investigate the nearby source and constrain its distance. Conversely, if the spectral bump is a widespread Galactic phenomenon, the energy dependence would exhibit uniformity across all GMCs, distinguishing the underlying mechanism accounting for the spectral bump from the scenario involving a nearby source.","['Xing-Jian Lv', 'Xiao-Jun Bi', 'Kun Fang', 'Peng-Fei Yin', 'Meng-Jie Zhao']",6.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14267,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-27
"Spectral properties of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195","We investigated simultaneous NICER plus NuSTAR observations of three neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195 using the latest reflection models, with the seed photons feeding into the corona originating from either the neutron star (NS) or the accretion disk. We found that, for the sources in the hard spectral state, more than $\sim$ 50% of the NS photons enter into the corona if NS provides seed photons, while only $\sim$ 3%-5% disk photons go to the corona if seed photons come from the disk. This finding, together with the derived small height of the corona, favors the lamp-post geometry or boundary layer scenario where the corona is close to the central neutron star. Additionally, we found that the source of the seed photons has big influence in the significance of the NS radiation, especially for the soft spectral state. This result may help explain why the NS radiation in MAXI J1816-195 is weak in the previous work. More importantly, for the first time, we explored the properties of the corona in the NS systems with the compactness ($l-\theta$) diagram. We found that the corona in the NS systems all lie in the left side of the pair-production forbidden region, away from the predicted pair-production lines. This finding indicates that either the corona in these NS systems is not pair-dominated, possibly due to the additional cooling from NS photons, or the corona is composed of both thermal and non-thermal electrons.","['Zhenyan Fei', 'Ming Lyu', 'Guobao Zhang', 'Xuejuan Yang', 'Federico García']",7.0,13.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14272,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['X-rays: binaries'],2025-01-27
Comparative analysis of two episodes of strongly geoeffective CME events in November and December 2023,"In autumn 2023, a series of closely timed eruptive events were observed remotely and measured in situ. We studied analogous solar events, where several CMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These events occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering October 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to strong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to understand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed geomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each CME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with enhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ measurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The first episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on November 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a SBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode saw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1, 2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a preceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the shock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field 'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This study compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and December 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations contributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November 4-5, 2023 event.

Revealing two orthogonally polarized spectral components in Vela X-1 with IXPE,"Polarimetric observations of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) have provided us with the key to unlocking their geometrical properties. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) the geometries of several XRPs have been determined, providing new insights into their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structures. Previously, Vela X-1 has proven to be exceptional in demonstrating a clear energy dependence of its polarimetric properties, showing a 90$^{\circ}$ swing in the polarization angle (PA) between low and high energies. Due to the complex energy-dependent nature of the polarization properties, it was not possible to determine the pulsar geometry. In this work, we present the results of a detailed analysis of the pulse phase-resolved polarization properties of at different energies. By separating the polarimetric analysis into low and high energy ranges, we are able to disentangle the contributions of the soft and hard spectral components to the polarization, revealing the pulse phase dependence of polarization degree (PD) and PA in each energy band. The PA pulse phase dependence at high energies (5$-$8 keV) allows us, for the first time, to determine the pulsar geometry in Vela X-1. The fit with the rotating vector model gives an estimate for the pulsar spin position angle at around 127$^{\circ}$ and for the magnetic obliquity of 13$^{\circ}$. In order to explain the 90$^{\circ}$ swing in PA between high and low energies, we discuss two possible scenarios: a two-component spectral model and the vacuum resonance.","['Sofia V.

Cosmic ray transport and acceleration in an evolving shock landscape,"The sources of cosmic rays between the knee and the ankle are still debated. The Galactic wind and its termination shock have been proposed to contribute to this transition between Galactic and extragalactic origin, but another possibility is large-scale shock structures from local sources in the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate CR transport in a time-dependent landscape of shocks in the Galactic halo. These shocks could result from local outbursts, e.g. starforming regions and superbubbles. CRs re-accelerated at such shocks can reach energies above the knee. Since the shocks are closer to the Galaxy than a termination shock and CRs escape downstream, they can propagate back more easily. With such outbursts happening frequently, shocks will interact. This interaction could adjust the CR spectrum, particularly for the particles that are able to be accelerated at two shocks simultaneously. The transport and acceleration of CRs at the shock is modeled by Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) within the public CR propagation framework CRPropa. We developed extensions for time-dependent wind profiles and for the first time connected the code to hydrodynamic simulations, which were run with the public Athena++ code. We find that, depending on the concrete realization of the diffusion tensor, a significant fraction of CRs can make it back to the Galaxy. These could contribute to the observed spectrum around and above the CR knee ($E \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$). In contrast to simplified models, a simple power-law does not describe the energy spectra well. Instead, for single shocks, we find a flat spectrum ($E^{-2}$) at low energies, which steepens gradually until it reaches an exponential decline. When shocks collide, the energy spectra transiently become harder than $E^{-2}$ at high energies.","['Sophie Aerdker', 'Roark Habegger', 'Lukas Merten', 'Ellen Zweibel', 'Julia Becker Tjus']",21.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14331,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Plasma', 'Acceleration of particles', 'Shock waves 1', 'Di ffusion', 'Turbulence']",2025-01-27
Two almost planetary mass survivors of common envelope evolution,"White dwarfs are often found in close binaries with stellar or even substellar companions. It is generally thought that these compact binaries form via common envelope evolution, triggered by the progenitor of the white dwarf expanding after it evolved off the main-sequence and engulfing its companion. To date, a handful of white dwarfs in compact binaries with substellar companions have been found, typically with masses greater than around 50 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Here we report the discovery of two eclipsing white dwarf plus brown dwarf binaries containing very low mass brown dwarfs. ZTF J1828+2308 consists of a hot ($15900\pm75$ K) $0.610\pm0.004$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 2.7 hour binary with a $0.0186\pm0.0008$ M$_{\odot}$ ($19.5\pm0.8$ M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) brown dwarf. ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a cool ($10000\pm110$ K) $0.65\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 5.7 hour binary with a companion that has a mass of less than 0.0211 M$_{\odot}$ (22.1 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). While the brown dwarf in ZTF J1828+2308 has a radius consistent with its mass and age, ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a roughly 20 per cent overinflated brown dwarf for its age. We are only able to reconstruct the common envelope phase for either system if it occurred after the first thermal pulse, when the white dwarf progenitor had already lost a significant fraction of its original mass. This is true even for very high common envelope ejection efficiencies ($\alpha_\mathrm{CE}\sim 1$), unless both systems have extremely low metallicities. It may be that the lowest mass companions can only survive a common envelope phase if it occurs at this very late stage.","['S. G. Parsons', 'A. J. Brown', 'S. L. Casewell', 'S. P.

"The NCORES Program: Precise planetary masses, null results, and insight into the planet mass distribution near the radius gap","NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.","['David J.

Uncovering the bias in the evidence for dynamical dark energy through minimal and generalized modeling approaches,"In this letter we argue that the CPL parameterisation for the dark energy equation of state is biased towards preferring such model over the constant $w$ while the latter bounds are still compatible with LCDM. For that we compare constraints on the EoS parameters $w_0$ and early time type $w_a$ (CPL) against those with a late time parameterisation on $w_a$ (LZ) and the constant $w$ model, using CMB, Supernovae and BAO from DESI datasets. We found, the same as was the case with CPL model, preference for dynamical dark energy within the LZ model, but for values almost symmetrically distributed with respect to their LCDM limits. This is due to the fact that the presence of $w_0$ allows to recast each parametrisation into making it compensate the preference for $w\sim -1$ in the opposite direction. To further test our hypothesis, we fixed $w_0$ to -1 and followed a minimal approach by considering models that deviates by one free parameter, or we extend to more general models that either group both late and early effects, or allow the presence of two dark energy fluid alike and constant alike component. We found that all the variants, except the original CPL are still compatible with LCDM, with likelihoods peaking close to $w_0 = -1$, $w_a = 0$, or 0.68 for $\Omega_{\rm CC}$, with the constant $w$ and the late time $w_a$ having the smallest constraints. Although we found that the evidence from CPL is stronger than those for the more minimal cases, however the preference increases further for the more generalized parameterizations, while still staying compatible with LCDM in terms of the significance levels. We conclude that considering CPL model is not sufficient to test deviation from the standard model and that it is necessary to conduct further minimal or more general approaches to better understand the outcomes from model testing and inference methods.(abridged)",['Ziad Sakr'],5.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14366,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-27
Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking,"We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. Our analysis contrasts the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee cosmology with standard cosmology in the context of primordial GW generation. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $l$ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario ($ l = 0 $). This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from $0$ to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.","['Mohsen Khodadi', 'Gaetano Lambiase', 'Leonardo Mastrototaro', 'Tanmay Kumar Poddar']",2.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14395,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,"['Primordial gravitational waves', 'Lorentz symmetry violation', 'Bumblebee gravity akhodadi@kntu', 'Inflation']",2025-01-27
Euclid preparation: Extracting physical parameters from galaxies with machine learning,"The Euclid mission is generating a vast amount of imaging data in four broadband filters at high angular resolution. This will allow the detailed study of mass, metallicity, and stellar populations across galaxies, which will constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Transforming the Euclid imaging for large samples of galaxies into maps of physical parameters in an efficient and reliable manner is an outstanding challenge. We investigate the power and reliability of machine learning techniques to extract the distribution of physical parameters within well-resolved galaxies. We focus on estimating stellar mass surface density, mass-averaged stellar metallicity and age. We generate noise-free, synthetic high-resolution imaging data in the Euclid photometric bands for a set of 1154 galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The images are generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, taking into account the complex 3D distribution of stellar populations and interstellar dust attenuation. We use a machine learning framework to map the idealised mock observational data to the physical parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We find that stellar mass surface density can be accurately recovered with a $\leq 0.130 {\rm \,dex}$ scatter. Conversely, stellar metallicity and age estimates are, as expected, less robust, but still contain significant information which originates from underlying correlations at a sub-kpc scale between stellar mass surface density and stellar population properties.","['Euclid Collaboration', 'I.

The wide binary frequency of metal-poor stars,"This study is aimed at identifying possible low-mass and sub-stellar companions to stars with well-determined metallicities. We investigate the multiplicity of metal-poor stars along with its impact on formation processes in the conditions of the early universe. Our goal is to look for wide common proper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency at low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and WISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of Gaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky. We combined the Gaia sample with other public catalogues and spectroscopic determinations for a given subsample to refine the stellar metallicities. We also considered other public catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We obtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging technique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610 metal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred a multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected separations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any other limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum binary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of metallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is relatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected separations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of metal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly lower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case. We interpret these similarities and differences as being due to the chemistry at work in molecular clouds as well as disruption effects attributed to the old age of subdwarfs.","['N. Lodieu', 'A.

MINCE III. Detailed chemical analysis of the UVES sample,"Context. The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate Metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to provide high quality neutron-capture abundances measurements in several hundred stars at intermediate metallicity,-2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.5. This project will shed light on the origin of the neutron-capture elements and the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way. Aims. The goal of this work is to chemically characterize the second sample of the MINCE project and compare the abundances with the galactic chemical evolution model at our disposal. Methods. We performed a standard abundance analysis based on 1D LTE model atmospheres on high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise-ratio UVES spectra. Results. We provide the kinematic classification (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, thin-to-thick disk, halo, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sequoia) of 99 stars and the atmospheric parameters for almost all stars. We derive the abundances for light elements (from Na to Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) in a subsample of 32 stars in the metallicity range -2.5 < Fe/H] < -1.00. In the subsample of 32 stars, we identify 8 active stars exhibiting (inverse) P-Cygni profile and one Li-rich star, CD 28-11039. We find a general agreement between the chemical abundances and the stochastic model computed for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way halo for the elements Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Eu . Conclusions. The MINCE project has already significantly increased the number of neutron-capture elements measurements in the intermediate metallicity range. The results from this sample are in perfect agreement with the previous MINCE sample. The good agreement between the chemical abundances and the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy supports the nucleosynthetic processes adopted to describe the origin of the n-capture elements.","['F.

Measuring Star Formation Rates in the Milky Way from Hi-GAL 70 $\mu$m Observations,"Three methods for computing the total star formation rate of the Milky Way agree well with a reference value of $1.65\pm0.19$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. They are then used to determine the radial dependence of the star formation rate and face-on map for the Milky Way. First, the method based on a model of star formation in Hi-GAL-defined dense clumps, adjusted for an increase in the gas-to-dust ratio with Galactocentric radius, predicts $1.65\pm0.61$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Second, the method using the 70 $\mu$m emission, commonly used in other galaxies, with a technique to assign distances to the extended emission, predicts $1.42^{+0.63}_{-0.44}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, a method based on theoretical predictions of star formation efficiency as a function of virial parameter, with masses corrected for metallicity dependence, applied to a catalog of molecular clouds also predicts a value in agreement at $1.47$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The three methods predict the radial variation of the star formation rate, with remarkably good agreement from the CMZ out to about 20 kpc. More differences were seen in face-on maps with a resolution of 0.5 kpc made with the three approaches and in comparisons to the local (within 3 kpc) star formation rate, indicating limitations of the methods when applied to smaller scales. The 70 $\mu$m star formation rate follows very closely the surface density of molecular gas, corrected for a metallicity-dependent CO conversion factor. A molecular gas depletion time of 1 Gyr is consistent with the data, as is a molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a power-law slope of $1.10 \pm 0.06$.","['D. Elia', 'N. J. Evans II', 'J. D.

Alignment and optical verification of DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE,"We developed, characterised, and verified an alignment method for the DESHIMA 2.0 instrument, an ultra wide-band spectrometer operating between 200-400 GHz, at the ASTE telescope. Due to the ultra-wide bandwidth of DESHIMA 2.0, we require the alignment to work across the entire spectral range. Moreover, alignment should be possible remotely, as on-site access is impractical. To fulfill these requirements we mounted the warm optics, consisting of a modified Dragonian dual reflector system, on a motor controlled hexapod. Crucial in the alignment procedure is our sky chopper, which allows fast beam switching. Importantly, it has a small entrance and exit aperture coupling to (cold) sky, which creates a measurable signal with respect to the warm cabin environment. By scanning the instrument beam across the entrance aperture of the sky chopper using the hexapod, we found the hexapod configuration that produced the lowest signal on our detectors, implying the beam is coupled fully to cold sky and not the warm cabin. We first characterised the alignment procedure in the laboratory, where we used a vat containing liquid nitrogen as the cold source behind the sky chopper. Then, we applied the alignment procedure to DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE, using the sky as the cold source. We used observations of Mars to calculate the aperture efficiency. We did not recover the aperture efficiencies up to design values, which we suspect to be due to a raised sidelobe level or error beam pattern. However, we did find that the alignment procedure significantly improved the aperture efficiency compared to previously reported values of the aperture efficiency of DESHIMA at ASTE, which indicates the veracity of the alignment procedure.","['A.

"Identification of 30,000 White Dwarf-Main Sequence binaries candidates from Gaia DR3 BP/RP(XP) low-resolution spectra","White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binary systems are essential probes for understanding binary stellar evolution and play a pivotal role in constraining theoretical models of various transient phenomena. In this study, we construct a catalog of WDMS binaries using Gaia DR3's low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra. Our approach integrates a model-independent neural network for spectral modelling with Gaussian Process Classification to accurately identify WDMS binaries among over 10 million stars within 1 kpc. This study identify approximately 30,000 WDMS binary candidates, including ~1,700 high-confidence systems confirmed through spectral fitting. Our technique is shown to be effective at detecting systems where the main-sequence star dominates the spectrum - cases that have historically challenged conventional methods. Validation using GALEX photometry reinforces the reliability of our classifications: 70\% of candidates with an absolute magnitude $M_{G} > 7$ exhibit UV excess, a characteristic signature of white dwarf companions. Our all-sky catalog of WDMS binaries expands the available dataset for studying binary evolution and white dwarf physics and sheds light on the formation of WDMS.","['Jiadong Li', 'Yuan-Sen Ting', 'Hans-Walter Rix', 'Gregory M.

"Matter creation, adiabaticity and phantom behavior","We present a novel cosmological framework that unifies matter creation dynamics with thermodynamic principles. Starting with a single-component fluid characterized by a constant equation of state parameter, $\omega$, we introduce a generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the entropy associated with the cosmic horizon. Imposing an adiabatic expansion condition uniquely determines the particle creation rate, $\Gamma$, a feature unprecedented in previous matter creation models. This mechanism yields a cosmology featuring phantom-like expansion while relying solely on a single constituent, which can be either a quintessence-like fluid or a non-exotic, non-relativistic dark matter component. Remarkably, this framework avoids the need for exotic physics while providing a consistent explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results open new pathways for understanding the interplay between horizon thermodynamics, particle creation, and cosmic evolution, offering fresh insights into the nature of dark energy and its potential thermodynamic origins.","['Víctor H.

Improving 1D stellar atmosphere models with insights from multi-dimensional simulations I. 1D vs 2D stratifications and spectral comparison for O stars,"We compare current 1D and multi-dimensional atmosphere modelling approaches for massive stars to understand their strengths and shortcomings. We calculate averaged stratifications from selected 2D calculations for O stars -- corresponding to the spectral types O8, O4, and O2 -- to approximate them with 1D stellar atmosphere models using the PoWR model atmosphere code and assuming a fixed $\beta-$law for the wind regime. We then study the effects of our approximations and assumptions on current spectral diagnostics. In particular, we focus on the impact of an additional turbulent pressure in the subsonic layers of the 1D models. To match the 2D averages, the 1D stellar atmosphere models need to account for turbulent pressure in the hydrostatic equation. Moreover, an adjustment of the connection point between the (quasi-)hydrostatic regime and the wind regime is required. The improvement between the density stratification of 1D model and 2D average can be further increased if the mass-loss rate of the 1D model is not identical to those of the 2D simulation, but typically $\sim0.2\,$dex higher. Especially for the early type star, this implies a significantly more extended envelope with a lower effective temperature. Already the inclusion of a constant turbulence term in the solution of the hydrostatic equation sufficiently reproduces the 2D-averaged model density stratifications. The addition of a significant turbulent motion also smoothens the slope of the radiative acceleration term in the (quasi-)hydrostatic domain, with several potential implications on the total mass-loss rate inferred from 1D modelling.

Simulations of Astrophysically Relevant Pair Beam Instabilities in a Laboratory Context,"The interaction of TeV blazars emitted gamma-rays with the extragalactic background photons gives rise to a relativistic beam of electron-positron ($e^- e^+$) pairs propagating through the intergalactic medium, producing a cascade through up-scattering low-energy photons. Plasma instability is considered one of the underlying energy-loss processes of the beams. We employ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the plasma instabilities of ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating in a denser background plasma, using the parameters designed to replicate astrophysical jets under laboratory conditions. In an astrophysical scenario with a broad, dilute beam, electromagnetic instability can be disregarded because its growth rate is slower than that of electrostatic instability, indicating the electromagnetic modes are suppressed. We calculate the physical limit of density contrast at which a warm beam achieves suppression of electromagnetic instabilities in laboratory experiments, consistent with the physically relevant conditions for Blazar-induced beams. We have used a composite Cauchy distribution for the beam particles, which is more realistic in representing the non-Maxwellian nature of pair beams, improving upon previous studies. We investigate the interplay between the magnetic field forming from localized currents and transverse beam momentum spread. We extrapolate to the non-linear feedback of instability where the beam is energetically broadened. We observe that the instability generates a negligible angular broadening for Blazar-Induced beams.","['Suman Dey', 'Günter Sigl']",12.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14518,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-27
Molecular inventory of a young eruptive star's environment -- Case study of the classical FU Orionis star V1057 Cyg,"Studying accretion-driven episodic outbursts in YSOs is key to understanding the later stages of star and planet formation. FU Orionis-type objects form a YSO subclass, distinguished by rapid, multi-magnitude increases in brightness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These outbursts may significantly impact the chemistry and molecular composition around eruptive stars. However, no comprehensive millimeter-wavelength line survey exists for more evolved (Class II) sources, unlike optical and near-infrared coverage. We conducted the first wideband millimeter spectral line survey of V1057 Cyg, a low-mass eruptive FUor with the highest observed peak accretion rate in its class. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope, we surveyed the 72-263 GHz range and complemented this with targeted spectra at 219, 227, 291, and 344 GHz with the APEX 12-m telescope. We conducted radiative transfer and population diagram analyses to get first estimates of the excitation temperatures and column densities. Several molecular species trace large-scale structures, and the position-velocity diagram of $^{12}$CO suggest episodic outburst activity, with outflow dynamical timescales on the order of tens of thousands of years. We identified simple molecules (C-, N-, O-, and S-bearing), deuterated species, molecular ions, and complex organic molecules. With over 30 molecular species (including isotopologues) detected, V1057 Cyg demonstrates rich chemistry for its evolutionary state, compared to other younger (Class 0/I) FUors. V1057 Cyg is a good candidate for future interferometric studies to resolve emission structures, to possibly constrain molecular freeze-out, and detect water and complex organic molecules. Our results highlight the importance of millimeter line surveys in complementing optical/near-infrared studies, improving statistics on molecular inventories in eruptive stars and their environments.","['Zs.

Giant Molecular Clouds in RCW 106 (G333): Galactic Mini-starbursts and Massive Star Formation Induced by Supersonic Cloud-Cloud Collisions,"To reveal the origin of the mini-starbursts in the Milky Way, we carried out large-scale CO observations toward the RCW 106 giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex using the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope operated by Nagoya University. We also analyzed the Mopra Southern Galactic plane CO survey and Herschel infrared continuum archival data. The RCW 106 GMC complex contains the radial velocity components of $-68$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-50$ km s$^{-1}$ reported by Nguyen et al. (2015). Focusing on the RCW 106 East and West region with the massive star formation having the bright infrared dust emission, we found that these regions have three different velocity components with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences. The two out of three velocity components show morphological correspondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge feature on a position-velocity diagram. Therefore, two molecular clouds (MCs) with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences are likely to be physically associated with massive star-forming regions in the GMC complex. Based on these observational results, we argue that mini-starbursts and massive star/cluster formation in the RCW 106 GMC complex are induced by supersonic cloud-cloud collisions in an agglomerate of molecular gas on the Scutum-Centurus arm.","['Mikito Kohno', 'Rin I.

ALPs production from Light Primordial Black Holes: the role of Superradiance,"Light Primordial Black Holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$ g $\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$ g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$ MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as moduli, predicted by String Theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called Superradiance Instability in the case of spinning PBHs. These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by Superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.","['Marco Manno', 'Daniele Montanino']",4.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14589,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-27
JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Super-Earth TOI-776b,"We present two transit observations of the $\sim$520K, 1.85R$_\oplus$, 4.0M$_\oplus$ super-Earth TOI-776b with JWST NIRSpec/G395H, resulting in a 2.8-5.2$\mu$m transmission spectrum. Producing reductions using the ExoTiC-JEDI and Eureka! pipelines, we obtain a median transit depth precision of 34ppm for both visits and both reductions in spectroscopic channels 30 pixels wide ($\sim$0.02$\mu$m). We find that our independent reductions produce consistent transmission spectra, however, each visit shows differing overall structure. For both reductions, a flat line is preferred for Visit 1 while a flat line with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors is preferred for Visit 2; however, we are able to correct for this offset during our modeling analysis following methods outlined in previous literature. Using picaso forward models, we can rule out metallicities up to at least 100$\times$ solar with an opaque pressure of 10$^{-3}$ bar to $\geq$3$\sigma$ in all cases, however, the exact lower limit varies between the visits, with Visit 1 ruling out $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar while the lower limits for Visit 2 extend beyond $\sim$350$\times$ solar.

Extracting the X-ray reverberation response functions from the AGN light curves using an autoencoder,"We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine-learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamp-post corona varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves, hence the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model to the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224-3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between $3~r_{\rm g}$ and $20~r_{\rm g}$, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.","['Sanhanat Deesamutara', 'Poemwai Chainakun', 'Tirawut Worrakitpoonpon', 'Kamonwan Khanthasombat', 'Wasutep Luangtip', 'Jiachen Jiang', 'Francisco Pozo Nuñez', 'Andrew J.

Thermal Spectra of Warped and Broken Accretion Disks,"Black holes may accrete gas with angular momentum vectors misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The resulting accretion disks are subject to Lense-Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and simulations show that Lense-Thirring precession will warp, and, for large misalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking occurs at $\lesssim10r_s$, where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering that accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are generally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how consistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically calculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break radius at $10r_s$ for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and the projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks significantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the multicolor blackbody relation $\nu L_\nu\propto\nu^{\gamma}=\nu^{4/3}$ at low frequencies $\nu$. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined disks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between $\gamma\approx0.91-1.26$ for the warped disks and $\gamma\approx1.37-1.54$ for the broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease when moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for inclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at radii $\geq50r_s$. Our results imply that accretion disks around black holes in the soft state warp or break at larger radii than suggested in GRHMD simulations.","['J. Speicher', 'O.

A theoretical approach to density-split clustering,"We present an analytical model for density-split correlation functions, that probe galaxy clustering in different density environments. Specifically, we focus on the cross-correlation between density-split regions and the tracer density field. We show that these correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the two-point probability density function (PDF) of the density field, or equivalently, its bias function. We derive analytical predictions using three levels of approximation for the two-point PDF: a bivariate Gaussian distribution, a bivariate shifted log-normal distribution, and a prediction based on the Large Deviation Theory framework. Under spherical symmetry $\unicode{x2013}$ where spherical collapse dynamics apply, such as for count-in-cell densities with spherical top-hat smoothing $\unicode{x2013}$ LDT predicts the density two-point PDF in the large-separation regime relative to the smoothing radius. We validate our model against dark matter N-body simulations in real space, incorporating Poisson shot noise. Our results show that the LDT predictions outperform the log-normal approximation, and agrees with simulations on large scales within the cosmic variance of a typical DESI DR1 sample, despite relying on only one degree of freedom.","['Mathilde Pinon', 'Arnaud de Mattia', 'Étienne Burtin', 'Vanina Ruhlmann-Kleider', 'Sandrine Codis', 'Enrique Paillas', 'Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro']",12.0,28.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14638,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-27
Automation of finding strong gravitational lenses in the Kilo Degree Survey with U-DenseLens (DenseLens + Segmentation),"In the context of upcoming large-scale surveys like Euclid, the necessity for the automation of strong lens detection is essential. While existing machine learning pipelines heavily rely on the classification probability (P), this study intends to address the importance of integrating additional metrics, such as Information Content (IC) and the number of pixels above the segmentation threshold, to alleviate the false positive rate in unbalanced data-sets. In this work, we introduce a segmentation algorithm (U-Net) as a supplementary step in the established strong gravitational lens identification pipeline (Denselens), which primarily utilizes P$_{\rm mean}$ and IC$_{\rm mean}$ parameters for the detection and ranking. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of segmentation enables significant reduction of false positives by approximately 25 per cent in the final sample extracted from DenseLens, without compromising the identification of strong lenses. The main objective of this study is to automate the strong lens detection process by integrating these three metrics. To achieve this, a decision tree-based selection process is introduced, applied to the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) data. This process involves rank-ordering based on classification scores, filtering based on Information Content, and segmentation score. Additionally, the study presents 14 newly discovered strong lensing candidates identified by the U-Denselens network using the KiDS DR4 data.","['Bharath Chowdhary Nagam', 'Léon V E Koopmans', 'Edwin A Valentijn', 'Gijs Verdoes Kleijn', 'Jelte T A de Jong', 'Nicola Napolitano', 'Rui Li', 'Crescenzo Tortora', 'Valerio Busillo', 'Yue Dong']",10.0,16.0,256.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14650,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['gravitational lensing: strong'],2025-01-27
How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?,"We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.","['Vadim Briaud', 'Alexandros Karam', 'Niko Koivunen', 'Eemeli Tomberg', 'Hardi Veermäe', 'Vincent Vennin']",6.0,31.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14681,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-27
Artificial Intelligence Could Have Predicted All Space Weather Events Associated with the May 2024 Superstorm,"Space weather, driven by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), poses significant risks to technological systems. Accurately forecasting these events and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of the complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$ superstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644, Earth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram cut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active region morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the occurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of CME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind measurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to sound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as one minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in predicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storm. These findings highlight the impressive potential of AI for space weather forecasting and as a tool to mitigate the impact of extreme solar events on critical infrastructure.","['Sabrina Guastavino', 'Edoardo Legnaro', 'Anna Maria Massone', 'Michele Piana']",6.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14684,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Space Physics'],,,['Physical Sciences'],2025-01-27
ngVLA Synthetic Observations of Ionized Gas in Massive Protostars,"Massive star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H II regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free-free continuum (93-GHz band), $\mathrm{H41\alpha}$, and $\mathrm{H38\alpha}$ recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of $\sim 2$ kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive ($> 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy.

Monte Carlo post-processing for radiation hydro simulations of accreting planets in protoplanetary disks,"This paper is part of a series investigating the observational appearance of planets accreting from their nascent protoplanetary disk (PPD). We evaluate the differences between gas temperature distributions determined in our radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations and those recalculated via post-processing with a Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transport (RT) scheme. Our MCRT simulations were performed for global PPD models, each composed of a local 3D high-resolution RHD model embedded in an axisymmetric global disk simulation. We report the level of agreement between the two approaches and point out several caveats that prevent a perfect match between the temperature distributions with our respective methods of choice. Overall, the level of agreement is high, with a typical discrepancy between the RHD and MCRT temperatures of the high-resolution region of only about 10 percent. The largest differences were found close to the disk photosphere, at the transition layer between optically dense and thin regions, as well as in the far-out regions of the PPD, occasionally exceeding values of 40 percent. We identify several reasons for these discrepancies, which are mostly related to general features of typical radiative transfer solvers used in hydrodynamical simulations (angle- and frequency-averaging and ignored scattering) and MCRT methods (ignored internal energy advection and compression and expansion work). This provides a clear pathway to reduce systematic temperature inaccuracies in future works. Based on MCRT simulations, we finally determined the expected error in flux estimates, both for the entire PPD and for planets accreting gas from their ambient disk, independently of the amount of gas piling up in the Hill sphere and the used model resolution.","['Anton Krieger', 'Hubert Klahr', 'Julio David Melon Fuksman', 'Sebastian Wolf']",28.0,31.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14858,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],A&A,,"['accretion disks 1', 'Hydrodynamics – Radiative transfer – Methods: numerical – Protoplanetary disks – Planet-disk interactions – Accretion']",2025-01-28
Limb-Brightened Jet in M87 from Anisotropic Nonthermal Electrons,"Very long baseline interferometry observations reveal that relativistic jets like the one in M87 have a limb-brightened, double-edged structure. Analytic and numerical models struggle to reproduce this limb-brightening. We propose a model in which we invoke anisotropy in the distribution function of synchrotron-emitting nonthermal electrons such that electron velocities are preferentially directed parallel to magnetic field lines, as suggested by recent particle-in-cell simulations of electron acceleration and the effects of synchrotron cooling. We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal electrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for synchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement our emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and produce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized general relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission is concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this feature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of microarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical predictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be tested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the GRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other targets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened synchrotron images of extragalactic jets.","['Yuh Tsunetoe', 'Dominic W.

In this work, we build models of dark matter annihilation within the prompt cusps that reside in galaxy clusters, showing that they dominate the total $\gamma$-ray annihilation signal. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, we find no evidence for a $\gamma$-ray excess from these sources, and set strong constraints on annihilating dark matter.

Modeling APOKASC-3 red giants: I. The first dredge-up and red giant branch bump,"We focus on two key diagnostics of stellar physics in red giant branch (RGB) stars: the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear processed material and the location of the red giant branch bump (RGBB). We compare asteroseismic and spectroscopic APOKASC-3 data with theoretical MESA models. Our FDU predictions have similar mass and metallicity trends to the data, but the observed magnitude of the change in $[{\rm C}/{\rm N}]$ in data is smaller than theoretical predictions by $0.1615 \pm 0.0760 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0108 \,({\rm sys}) \,{\rm dex}$. These results are insensitive to the input physics, but they are at a level consistent with systematic uncertainties in the abundance measurements. When we include observed trends in birth $[{\rm C}/{\rm Fe}]$ and $[{\rm N}/{\rm Fe}]$ in our models, it modestly stretches the metallicity dependent difference relative to the data. We find a well-defined empirical RGBB locus: $\log g = 2.6604 - 0.1832 (M/{\rm M}_\odot-1) + 0.2824 \,[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]$. Our model RGBB loci have mass and composition trends that mirror the data, but we find that the observed RGBB is $0.1509 \pm 0.0017 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0182 \,({\rm sys})$ magnitudes higher than predicted across the board, similar to prior literature results. We find that envelope overshooting, proposed solution to reconcile theory with data, increases ${\rm Li}$ destruction during the FDU at higher metallicities, creating tension with depletion observed in GALAH data. We propose ${\rm Li}$ in the FDU as a sensitive test of the RGBB and FDU, and discuss other potential solutions.","['Kaili Cao', 'Marc H.

Tracking X-ray Variability in Next Generation EHT LLAGN Targets,"We present a 5 month NICER X-ray monitoring campaign for two low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) -- NGC 4594 and IC 1459 -- with complementary Swift and NuSTAR observations. Utilizing an absorbed power law and thermal source model combined with NICER's SCORPEON background model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of joint source/background modeling for constraining emission from faint, background-dominated targets. Both sources are dominated by nuclear power law emission with photon indices $\Gamma \sim 1.5 - 2$, with NGC 4594 being slightly harder than IC 1459. The thermal contribution in both sources is fainter, but constant, with $kT \sim 0.5$ keV ($\sim 5 \times 10^6$ K). The power law flux and $\Gamma$ are strongly anti-correlated in both sources, as has been seen for other LLAGNs with radiatively inefficient accretion flows. NGC 4594 is the brighter source and exhibits significant aperiodic variability. Its variability timescale with an upper limit of $5 - 7$ days indicates emission originating from $< 100 R_{g}$, at the scale of the inner accretion flow. A spectral break found at $\sim 6$ keV, while tentative, could arise from synchrotron/inverse compton emission.

Refining local-type primordial non-Gaussianity: Sharpened $b_\phi$ constraints through bias expansion,"Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized by the product $b_\phi f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, where $b_\phi$ is an astrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However, $b_\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and other astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\phi$ can significantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek a connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\phi}$ for halo and galaxy samples, constructed using the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and mimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo samples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\%, with most of that improvement coming from $b_\nabla$, which we find to be an excellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces the uncertainty on $b_\phi$ by 80\% for all tracers. By adopting Lagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\phi$, future analyses can thus constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.","['Boryana Hadzhiyska', 'Simone Ferraro']",6.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14873,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,[],2025-01-28
JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82,"We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in thisthis http URLresults suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.","['V.

Ion Beam Instabilities during Solar Flare Energy Release,"The linear stability of waves driven by ion beams produced during solar flare energy release are explored to assess their role in driving abundance enhancements in minority species such as $^3$He and in controlling, through pitch-angle scattering, proton/alpha confinement during energy release. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS) is used to solve the linear dispersion relation for a population of energetic, reconnection-accelerated protons streaming into a cold background plasma. We assume equal densities of the two populations, using an anisotropic ($T_\parallel/T_\perp = 10$), one-sided kappa distribution for the energetic streaming population and a cold Maxwellian for the background. We find two unstable modes with parallel propagation: a right-handed wave with a frequency of the order of the proton cyclotron frequency ($\Omega_{cp}$) and a left-handed, lower frequency mode. We also find highly oblique modes with frequencies below $\Omega_{cp}$ that are unstable for higher beam energies. Through resonant interactions, all three modes will contribute to the scattering of the high-energy protons, thereby limiting their transport out of the flare-acceleration region. The higher-frequency oblique mode, which can be characterized as a kinetic Alfvén wave, will preferentially heat $^3$He, making it a good candidate for the driver of the abundance enhancements commonly observed for this species in impulsive events.","['A.

Oscillatory Line-Driven Winds: The Role of Atmospheric Stratification,"In a recent study, Dannen et al. surveyed a large parameter space to study the transition from efficient to inefficient line driving. They found that when the line force significantly weakens due to ionization, the winds are variable, with a characteristic frequency comparable to the Lamb cut-off frequency of a stratified atmosphere, {\omega}c. In this work, we present a set of simulations and perturbation analyses that elucidate the variability source and characteristics. We found that the line force adds wave energy and amplifies perturbations with frequencies near {\omega}c. This selective amplification results from the coupling between the natural tendency of velocity perturbations to grow in a stratified atmosphere and the dependence of the line force on the velocity gradient, per the Castor-Abbott-Klein line-driven wind theory. We also found that the variability stems from self-excitation that occurs in the exponential atmosphere due to the non-linearity introduced by the absolute value of the velocity gradient in the line force prescription. We conclude that self-consistently calculating ionization is insufficient for modeling the dynamics in the subsonic atmosphere. Instead future wind models should relax the Sobolev approximation, or model the radiative transfer to capture the dynamics and instabilities at the base of the wind.","['Joshua Key', 'Daniel Proga', 'Randall Dannen', 'Sterling Vivier', 'Timothy Waters']",5.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14901,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: active - : numerical - hydrodynamics - radiation: dynamics 1'],2025-01-28
"Testing the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity models via effective equation of state constraints","This paper rigorously examines the potential of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory as a promising framework for understanding the dark sector of the universe, particularly in relation to cosmic acceleration. The $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory extends gravitational dynamics by incorporating both the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. Further, we explore the functional form $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = T + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\beta$ is a free parameter that modulates the matter's influence on spacetime evolution. To evaluate this model, we employ an effective EoS parameter dependent on redshift $z$, to solve the field equations and analyze the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Using a joint dataset ($H(z)+Pantheon^+$) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Bayesian analysis, we obtain the best-fit parameter values: $H_0 = 68.04 \pm 0.64$, $\beta = 0.14 \pm 0.17$, and $\gamma = 0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.69}$, which align well with current observational data. Our findings indicate a deceleration parameter of $q_0 = -0.51$, supporting a present-day accelerated expansion phase, with a transition redshift $z_t = 0.57$ marking the universe's shift from deceleration to acceleration. Moreover, we confirm a positive cosmic fluid energy density, reinforcing stability, and find an EoS parameter value of $\omega_0 = -0.76$, consistent with quintessence-driven acceleration. These results underscore the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ as a robust framework for addressing the accelerating universe and dark energy dynamics, paving the way for future investigations into its cosmological implications.","['M.

Cuscuton-like contribution to dark energy evolution,"This work deals with the presence of the cuscuton term in the otherwise standard dark energy evolution under the usual FLRW background. We disclose a first-order framework similar to the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, which helps us to solve the equations of motion and find analytical solutions. We explore several possibilities, concentrating mainly on how the cuscuton-like contribution works to modify cosmic evolution. Some results are of current interest since they describe scenarios capable of changing the evolution, adding or excluding possible distinct phases during the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, we present interesting constraints on the cuscuton-like contribution for the dark energy evolution using a set of homogeneous geometrical observational probes. Finally, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we perform a statistical comparison of the cuscuton-like model with $\Lambda$CDM, and find strong support for our model.","['D. Bazeia', 'J.

Comparing Methods for Calculating Solar Energetic Particle Intensities: Re-binning versus Spectral Binning,"Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed for decades in the interplanetary medium by spacecraft measuring the intensity of energetic ions and electrons. These intensities provide valuable information about particle acceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and the anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are typically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to re-bin intensities over a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two methods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: a) \textit{re-binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm linlin}\)), which is calculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to the intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral index, and b) \textit{spectral binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm loglog}\)), calculated by integrating the log-intensity in log-energy space, yielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the spectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS\(\odot\)IS measurements of energetic protons, and we prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different scenarios. Our results show that the re-binned intensity is consistently larger (up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events observed by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly correlated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and the selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical (spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (re-binned intensity) representation is needed for a given analysis.","['M.

"Supernovae Ia, high-redshift probes, and the Hubble tension: current status and future perspectives","The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension is one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmology. This consists of the discrepancy, at around $5\sigma$, between the local value of $H_0$ measured through Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) constrained with the Cepheids and the value inferred from the observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by Planck data. According to the most appealing cosmological models, such as the flat $\Lambda$CDM, the $H_0$ should not vary according to the measurement method or the redshift $z$ of the probe used for estimating it. Thus, many ideas have been proposed in the literature to face this tension. In the current work, we summarize the results obtained with the binned analysis of SNe Ia, showing a decreasing trend for $H_0$ with $z$ with an evolutionary coefficient $\eta \sim 0.01$, and we further discuss the impact of high-$z$ probes such as Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and quasars (QSOs) that allow reaching constraints on the cosmological parameters that will extend the Hubble diagram to high-$z$ values.","['Maria Giovanna Dainotti', 'Biagio De Simone']",2.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14944,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-28
"A Data-Driven M Dwarf Model and Detailed Abundances for $\sim$17,000 M Dwarfs in SDSS-V","The cool temperatures of M dwarf atmospheres enable complex molecular chemistry, making robust characterization of M dwarf compositions a long-standing challenge. Recent modifications to spectral synthesis pipelines have enabled more accurate modeling of M dwarf atmospheres, but these methods are too slow for characterizing more than a handful of stars at a time. Data-driven methods such as The Cannon are viable alternatives, and can harness the information content of many M dwarfs from large spectroscopic surveys. Here, we train The Cannon on M dwarfs with FGK binary companions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper (SDSS-V/MWM), with spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The FGK-M pairs are assumed to be chemically homogeneous and span $-$0.56 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.31 dex. The resulting model is capable of inferring M dwarf $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ and elemental abundances for Fe, Mg, Al, Si, C, N, O, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with median uncertainties of 13 K and 0.018$-$0.029 dex, respectively. We test the model by verifying that it reproduces reported abundance values of M dwarfs in open clusters and benchmark M dwarf datasets, as well as expected metallicity trends from stellar evolution. We apply the model to 16,590 M dwarfs in SDSS-V/MWM and provide their detailed abundances in our accompanying catalog.","['Aida Behmard', 'Melissa K. Ness', 'Andrew R.

Global Heliospheric Termination Shock Strength in the Solar-Interstellar Interaction,"A heliospheric termination shock (HTS) surrounds our solar system at approximately 100 astronomical units from the Sun, where the expanding solar wind (SW) is compressed and heated before encountering the interstellar medium. HTS-accelerated particles govern the pressure balance with the interstellar medium, but little is known about the HTS's global properties beyond in situ measurements from Voyager in only two directions of the sky. We fill this gap in knowledge with a novel and complex methodology: particle-in-cell, test particle, and MHD simulations, combined with a global minimization scheme to derive global HTS compression ratio sky maps. The methods utilize Interstellar Boundary Explorer observations of energetic neutral atoms produced from HTS-accelerated particles. Our results reveal unique, three-dimensional characteristics, such as higher compression near the poles during solar minimum, north-south asymmetries from the disparate polar coronal holes' evolution, and minimum compression near the flanks likely from SW slowing by mass-loading over a greater distance to the HTS.","['E.

SPOCK 2.0: Update to the FeatureClassifier in the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier,"The Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package collects machine learning models for predicting the stability and collisional evolution of compact planetary systems. In this paper we explore improvements to SPOCK's binary stability classifier (FeatureClassifier), which predicts orbital stability by collecting data over a short N-body integration of a system. We find that by using a system-specific timescale (rather than a fixed $10^4$ orbits) for the integration, and by using this timescale as an additional feature, we modestly improve the model's AUC metric from 0.943 to 0.950 (AUC=1 for a perfect model). We additionally discovered that $\approx 10\%$ of N-body integrations in SPOCK's original training dataset were duplicated by accident, and that $<1\%$ were misclassified as stable when they in fact led to ejections. We provide a cleaned dataset of 100,000+ unique integrations, release a newly trained stability classification model, and make minor updates to the API.","['Elio Thadhani', 'Yolanda Ba', 'Hanno Rein', 'Daniel Tamayo']",0.0,3.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15017,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics', 'Machine Learning']",RNAAS,,[],2025-01-28

Study of long-term spectral evolution and X-ray and Gamma-ray correlation of blazars seen by HAWC,"The HAWC Observatory collected 6 years of extensive data, providing an ideal platform for long-term monitoring of blazars in the Very High Energy (VHE) band, without bias towards specific flux states. HAWC continuously monitors blazar activity at TeV energies, focusing on sources with a redshift of {z \lt 0.3}, based on the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy sources. We specifically focused our analysis on Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, as they are the brightest blazars observed by the HAWC Observatory. With a dataset of 2143 days, this work significantly extends the monitoring previously published, which was based on 511 days of observation. By utilizing HAWC data for the VHE {\gamma}-ray emission in the 300 GeV to 100 TeV energy range, in conjunction with Swift-XRT data for the 0.3 to 10 keV X-ray emission, we aim to explore potential correlations between these two bands. For Mrk 501, we found evidence of a long-term correlation. Additionally, we identified a period in the light curve where the flux was very low for more than two years. On the other hand, our analysis of Mrk 421 measured a strong linear correlation for quasi-simultaneous observations collected by HAWC and Swift-XRT. This result is consistent with a linear dependence and a multiple-zone synchrotron self-Compton model to explain the X-ray and the {\gamma}-ray emission. Finally, as suggested by previous findings, we confirm a harder-when-brighter behavior in the spectral evolution of the flux properties for Mrk 421. These findings contribute to the understanding of blazar emissions and their underlying mechanisms.","['R. Alfaro', 'C. Alvarez', 'A. Andrés', 'J.C. Arteaga-Velázquez', 'D. Avila Rojas', 'H.A.

Spatially-resolved spectro-photometric SED Modeling of NGC 253's Central Molecular Zone I. Studying the star formation in extragalactic giant molecular clouds,"Studying the interstellar medium in nearby starbursts is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms driving these objects, thought to resemble young star-forming galaxies. This study aims to analyze the physical properties of the first spatially-resolved multi-wavelength SED of an extragalactic source, spanning six decades in frequency (from near-UV to cm wavelengths) at an angular resolution of 3$^{\prime\prime}$ (51 pc at the distance of NGC,253). We focus on the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC,253, which contains giant molecular clouds (GMCs) responsible for half of the galaxy's star formation.

BPT and WHAN diagrams indicate shock signatures in NGC~253's nuclear region, associating it with AGN/star-forming hybrids, though the AGN fraction is negligible ($\leq$7.5%).

Redshift drift effect through the observation of HI 21cm signal with SKA,"This study presents the findings of using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope to measure redshift drift via the HI 21cm signal, employing semi-annual observational interval within redshift around z $\sim$ 1 with main goal is to directly gauge the universe's expansion acceleration rate with millimeter-per-second (mm/s) precision. The SKA can detect over a billion HI 21cm emissions from individual galaxies to the redshift z $\sim$ 2 and thousands of absorption lines from Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems against bright quasars to the redshift z $\sim$ 13, with the sensitivity limit of 100 mJy. By utilizing SKA's high spectral resolution settings (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01 Hz) to detect redshift drift, particularly focusing on the 0.001 and 0.002 Hz configuration, one aims to achieve the necessary mm/s in precision measurement by the 0.5-year observation period.

"Mapping Galaxy Images Across Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared Bands Using Generative Deep Learning","We demonstrate that generative deep learning can translate galaxy observations across ultraviolet, visible, and infrared photometric bands. Leveraging mock observations from the Illustris simulations, we develop and validate a supervised image-to-image model capable of performing both band interpolation and extrapolation. The resulting trained models exhibit high fidelity in generating outputs, as verified by both general image comparison metrics (MAE, SSIM, PSNR) and specialized astronomical metrics (GINI coefficient, M20). Moreover, we show that our model can be used to predict real-world observations, using data from the DECaLS survey as a case study. These findings highlight the potential of generative learning to augment astronomical datasets, enabling efficient exploration of multi-band information in regions where observations are incomplete. This work opens new pathways for optimizing mission planning, guiding high-resolution follow-ups, and enhancing our understanding of galaxy morphology and evolution.","['Youssef Zaazou', 'Alex Bihlo', 'Terrence S.

Evidence for Magneto-gravitational Processes in Supermassive Black Hole Binary PG 1553+113,"PG1553+113 has drawn significant attention for its quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in gamma-ray variability, though the origin of its variability remains uncertain. In this study, we propose a physical mechanism to explain the observed gamma-ray variability within the framework of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, supported by a newly identified component hidden in the light curve. A detailed analysis for its about 16-year light curve obtained from Fermi-LAT observations is performed by Gaussian process (GP). As anticipated, the QPO of 2.1 years is effectively captured by the stochastically-driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) kernel within the under-damped regime, and the overall stochastic nature of the variability is described by the damped random walk (DRW) kernel albeit with an unconstrained damping timescale. Additionally, our results reveal a previously unrecognized component in active galactic nuclei variability, characterized by the Matérn-3/2 kernel, which is typically associated with systems undergoing abrupt energy release. These findings can be consistently interpreted within the SMBHB framework. The QPO of about 2.1 years is likely attributed to the orbital motion in a SMBHB system. The Matérn-3/2 component is interpreted as resulting from magnetic reconnection events triggered by gravitational perturbations of the magnetic field within the jet, occurring as one black hole approaches the other. Meanwhile, in this case, the damping timescale of the common DRW kernel remains unconstrained due to the influence of new perturbations within the system.","['Haiyun Zhang', 'Dahai Yan', 'Li Zhang', 'Niansheng Tang']",9.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15169,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,,['method:dataanalysis—BLLacertaeobjects:individual:PG1553+113—galaxies:jets—gammarays:galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION PG1553+113isoneofthebrightesthigh-frequency-peakedBLLac witharedshiftof 𝑧=0'],2025-01-28
Logarithmic Separable Solutions of Force-Free Magnetic Fields in Plane-Parallel and Axial Symmetry,"This work introduces a systematic method for identifying analytical and semi-analytical solutions of force-free magnetic fields with plane-parallel and axial symmetry. The method of separation of variables is used, allowing the transformation of the non-linear partial differential equation, corresponding to force-free magnetic fields, to a system of decoupled ordinary differential equations, which nevertheless, are in general non-linear. It is then shown that such solutions are feasible for configurations where the electric current has a logarithmic dependence to the magnetic field flux. The properties of the magnetic fields are studied for a variety of physical parameters, through solution of the systems of the ordinary differential equations for various values of the parameters. It is demonstrated that this new logarithmic family of solutions has properties that are highly distinct from the known linear and non-linear equations, as it allows for bounded solutions of magnetic fields, for periodic solutions and for solutions that extend to infinity. Possible applications to astrophysical fields and plasmas are discussed as well as their use in numerical studies, and the overall enrichment of our understanding of force-free configurations.",['Konstantinos N.

Cosmic distance duality after DESI 2024 data release and dark energy evolution,"The cosmic distance duality relates the angular-diameter and luminosity distances and its possible violation may puzzle the standard cosmological model. This appears particularly interesting in view of the recent results found by the DESI Collaboration, suggesting that a dynamical dark energy scenario seems to be favored than a genuine cosmological constant. Accordingly, we take into account possible violations by considering four different parameterizations, namely: a Taylor expansion around $z\simeq 0$, a slightly-departing logarithmic correction, a (1;2) Padé rational series to heal the convergence problem and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion, reducing \emph{de facto} the systematic errors associated with the analysis. We test each of them in a model-independent (-dependent) way, by working out Monte-Carlo Markov chain analyses, employing the Bézier interpolation of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ for the model-independent approach while assuming the flat (non-flat) $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, motivating the latter paradigm in view of the DESI findings. Subsequently, we explore two analyses, employing observational Hubble data, galaxy clusters from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and type Ia supernovae, investigating the impact of the DESI data catalog, first including then excluding the entire data set. Afterwards, we adopt statistical model selection criteria to assess the statistically favored cosmological model. Our results suggest \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality. While a slight spatial curvature cannot be entirely excluded, the preferred cosmological model remains the flat $\Lambda$CDM background, even when incorporating DESI data. Finally, concerning the Hubble tension, our findings match the Riess estimates, as BAO data points are excluded.","['Anna Chiara Alfano', 'Orlando Luongo']",3.0,18.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15233,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-28
Highly Variable Quasar Candidates Selected from 4XMM-DR13 with Machine Learning,"We present a sample of 12 quasar candidates with highly variable soft X-ray emission from the 4th XMM-newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) using random forest. We obtained optical to mid-IR photometric data for the 4XMM-DR13 sources by correlating the sample with the SDSS DR18 photometric database and the AllWISE database. By cross-matching this sample with known spectral catalogs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, we obtained a training data set containing stars, galaxies, and quasars. The random forest algorithm was trained to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. We further filtered the classified quasar candidates with $\it{Gaia}$ proper motion to remove stellar contaminants. Finally, 53,992 quasar candidates have been classified, with 10,210 known quasars matched in SIMBAD. The quasar candidates have systematically lower X-ray fluxes than quasars in the training set, which indicates the classifier is helpful to single out fainter quasars. We constructed a sample of 12 sources from these quasars candidates which changed their soft X-ray fluxes by a factor of 10 over $\sim$ 20 years in the 4XMM-newton survey. Our selected highly variable quasar candidates extend the quasar sample, characterized by extreme soft X-ray variability, to the optically faint end with magnitudes around $r \sim 22$. None of the 12 sources were detected in ROSAT observations. Given the flux limit of ROSAT, the result suggests that quasars exhibiting variations of more than two orders of magnitudes are extremely rare.","['Heng Wang', 'Yanli Ai', 'Yanxia Zhang', 'Yuming Fu', 'Wenfeng Wen', 'Liming Dou', 'Xue-Bing Wu', 'Xiangru Li', 'Zhiying Huo']",3.0,12.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15254,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['X-rays: general – galaxies: active – galaxies: Seyfert – quasars: general 1'],2025-01-28
Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions,"We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.","['Kanji Mori', 'Tomoya Takiwaki', 'Kei Kotake', 'Shunsaku Horiuchi']",6.0,6.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15256,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,substantial efforts have been dedicated to develop multi-dimensional supernova models coupled with the neutrino transport (e supernovae: general — neutrinos — astroparticle physics ,2025-01-28
Scalar-Tensor Gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data,"We discuss the implications of the DESI 2024 BAO data on scalar-tensor models of gravity. We consider four representative models: induced gravity (IG, equivalent to Jordan-Brans-Dicke), where we either fix today's value of the effective gravitational constant on cosmological scales to the Newton's constant or allow them to differ, Jordan-Brans-Dicke supplemented with a Galileon term (BDG), and early modified gravity (EMG) with a conformal coupling. In this way it is possible to investigate how different modified gravity models compare with each other when confronted with DESI 2024 BAO data. Compared to previous analyses, for all of these models, the combination of Planck and DESI data favors a larger value of the key parameter of the theory, such as the nonminimal coupling to gravity or the Galileon term, leading also to a larger value of $H_0$, due to the known degeneracy between these parameters. These new results are mainly driven by the first two redshift bins of DESI. In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models considered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results and reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\sigma$ (compared to $4.5\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).","['Angelo G.

Observations of the X-ray Millihertz Quasiperiodic Oscillations in Hercules X-1,"With a systematic timing investigation of the persistent X-ray binary pulsar Her X-1 based on a large number of Insight-HXMT observations between 2017 to 2019, we confirm the presence of X-ray millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) at $\sim 0.01$ Hz. By applying wavelet analysis in our data analysis procedures, we firstly identified $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz QPOs coexisting with the $\sim 0.01$ Hz QPOs. Wavelet analysis suggests that these QPO features show transient behaviors, frequencies of mHz QPOs evolved in short time scales. There exists a positive relation between QPO centroid frequency (from $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz) and the X-ray luminosity, while the 10 mHz QPO frequencies keep nearly constant for different luminosities, which suggests different physical mechanisms for two types of mHz QPOs. The 10 mHz QPOs in both X-ray and UV bands would have the same origin related to the beat frequency where the Alfv$\acute{e}$n radius is close to the corotation radius, and the 5 mHz QPOs may originate from magnetic disk precession.","['Wen Yang', 'Wei Wang']",5.0,9.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15366,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,['stars: neutron- X-rays: bursts- X-rays: binaries- individual: Hercules X-1 1'],2025-01-28
"Constraining Disk-to-Corona Power Transfer Fraction, Soft X-ray Excess Origin, and Black Hole Spin Population of Type-1 AGN across Mass Scales","Understanding the nature of the accretion disk, its interplay with the X-ray corona, and assessing black hole spin demographics are some open challenges in astrophysics. In this work, we examine the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-disk model, origin of the soft X-ray excess, and measure the black hole spin parameter by applying the updated high-density disk reflection model to the XMM-Newton/NuSTAR broadband (0.3$-$78 keV) X-ray spectra of a sample of Type-1 AGN. Our Bayesian analysis confirms that the high-density relativistic reflection model with a broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously fit the soft X-ray excess, broad iron K line, and Compton hump for $\sim$70% of the sample, while an additional warm Comptonization model is still required to describe the observed soft X-ray excess for the remaining sources. Our first-ever calculation of the disk-to-corona power transfer fraction reveals that the fraction of power released from the accretion disk into the hot corona can have diverse values, the sample median of which is $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$. We find that the transferred power from the accretion disk can potentially soften the X-ray spectrum of the hot corona. The median values of the hot coronal temperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be $63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through joint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically constrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole masses, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available spin measurements in the AGN population by $\sim$20%.","['Labani Mallick', 'Ciro Pinto', 'John Tomsick', 'Alex Markowitz', 'Andrew Fabian', 'Samar Safi-Harb', 'James Steiner', 'Fabio Pacucci', 'William Alston']",14.0,42.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15380,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Space Physics']",,,['Black hole physics(159) — Accretion (14) — Supermassive bla ck holes (1663) — X-ray active galactic nuclei(2035) 1'],2025-01-28
Detection of the cosmological evolution of the Doppler factor for blazars jets,"The Doppler factor ($\delta$) is a fundamental quality for the relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). It is also fundamental to assessing the number of the entire population of the jetted AGN at high redshift ($z$), and therefore is important for tracing the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) across cosmic time. Here we present the identification of the positive cosmic evolution of the Doppler factor in {\it Fermi}-detected bright $\gamma-$ray blazars. The redshift dependence of the Doppler factor, $\delta\propto(1+z)^{0.8}$, is measured from the observed characteristic energies in the gamma-ray spectra of 141 blazars. Moreover, the analysis of the characteristic timescales derived from modeling the long-term optical light curves of 89 blazars with Gaussian process regression gives $\delta\propto(1+z)^{1.1}$, but with a larger scatter. \textbf{Note that each index is derived from the entire sample, representing an average evolution. Interestingly, the index itself also appears to evolve, with low-luminosity sources showing stronger evolution, as indicated by a larger index.} This detection straightly suggests that relativistic jets from AGNs are much more common at high redshifts than what is previously estimated.","['Dahai Yan', 'Haiyun Zhang', 'Jianeng Zhou', 'Lijuan Dong']",4.0,5.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15441,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-28
Novel Dark Matter Signatures,"Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.","['A. Argiriou', 'G. Cantatore', 'S.A. Cetin', 'E. Georgiopoulou', 'D.H.H.

The role of equation of state on the spin-up of millisecond pulsars,"Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are recycled pulsars which have been spun-up due to mass accretion during the phase of mass exchange in binaries. Although the interactions with companion stars play important roles on the spin-up process, the global properties of pulsars determined by the equation of state (EoS), such as mass, radius and the moment of inertia, should also play a role. We investigate the spin-up of MSPs in neutron star (NS) and strangeon star (SS) models, both of which have passed the tests by the existence of high-mass pulsars and the tidal deformability of GW170817. Combining the spin-up condition and the transferred angular momentum, we can constrain the accreted mass and the magnetic field strength. The results indicate that it is easier for an SS to form a fully recycled low-mass MPS, whose spin-period is below 10 ms and mass is below about $1.5 M_\odot$, than that for an NS. Finding more MSPs with low mass and and short spin-period could help to put more strict constraints on the EoS of pulsars.","['Xinyi Zhong', 'Xiaoyu Lai']",4.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15502,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['dense matter — stars: neutron — pulsars: genera Corresponding author: Xiaoyu Lai laixy@hue'],2025-01-28
The influence of dust growth on the observational properties of circumplanetary discs,"Dust growth is often indirectly inferred observationally in star-forming environments, theoretically predicted to produce mm-sized particles in circumstellar discs, and also presumably witnessed by the predecessors of the terrestrial meteoritic record. For those reasons it is believed that young gas giants under formation in protoplanetary discs with putative circumplanetary discs (CPDs) surrounding them, such as PDS 70c, should be containing mm-sized particles. We model the spectra of a set of CPDs, which we obtained from radiation hydrodynamic simulations at varying Rosseland opacities kappa_R. The kappa_R from the hydrodynamic simulations are matched with consistent opacity sets of ISM-like composition, but grown to larger sizes. Our high kappa_R hydro data nominally corresponds to 10 mum-sized particles, and our low kappa_R-cases correspond to mm-sized particles. We investigate the resulting broad spectral features at first while keeping the overall optical depth in the planetary envelope constant. Dust growth to size distributions dominated by millimeter particles generally results in broad, featureless spectra with black-body like slopes in the far-infrared, while size distributions dominated by small dust develop steeper slopes in the far-infrared and maintain some features stemming from individual minerals. We find that significant dust growth from microns to millimeters can explain the broad features of the PDS 70c data, when upscaling the dust masses from our simulations by x100. Furthermore our results indicate that the spectral range of 30-500 mum is an ideal hunting ground for broadband features arising from the CPD, but that longer wavelengths observed with ALMA can also be used for massive circumplanetary discs","['Matthäus Schulik', 'Bertram Bitsch', 'Anders Johansen', 'Michiel Lambrechts']",8.0,12.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15521,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,A&A,,['giant planet formation – simulations – radiation hydrodynamics 1'],2025-01-28

Investigating the intrinsic distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the population information of FRBs released in the CHIME catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population. Taking into account the uncertainties and complex relationships within the data.

Discovery of a new phase-transient cyclotron line in A0535+26: Constraints on the accretion geometry,"In November 2020, A0535+26 underwent one of its brightest outbursts, reaching nearly 12 Crab in X-ray flux.

Novel SIMEX algorithm for autoregressive models to estimate AGN variability,"The origin of the variability in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still unknown, but its behavior can be characterized by modeling the time series of optical wavelength fluxes coming from the accretion disks with damped random walk (DRW) being the most popular model for this purpose. The DRW is modeled by a characteristic fluctuation amplitude and damping timescale {\tau}, with the latter being potentially related to the mass and accretion rate onto the massive black hole. The estimation of {\tau} is challenging, with commonly used methods such as the maximum likelihood (ML) and the least square error (LSE) resulting in biased estimators. This problem arises most commonly for three reasons: i) the light curve has been observed with additive noise; ii) some cadence scheme; iii) when the autocorrelation parameter is close to one. The latter is called the unit root problem. In order to improve these parameter estimation procedures for estimating {\tau}, we developed a simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) methodology in the context of time series analysis. We consider both the standard class of autoregressive processes observed at regular intervals and a recently developed class of irregularly autoregressive processes (iAR). The performance of the SIMEX estimation method was evaluated under conditions of near-unit-root behavior and additive noise through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the SIMEX approach outperforms MLE and LSE methods, offering a reduction in estimation bias ranging from 30% to 90%. Real-data applications further validate the methodology, yielding better model fits and lower mean squared errors (MSE). The more accurate estimation of the damping timescale parameter can help to better understand the currently tentative links between DRW and physical parameters in AGN.","['Felipe Elorrieta', 'Wilfredo Palma', 'Susana Eyheramendy', 'Franz E.

Redistribution of ices between grain populations in protostellar envelopes. Only the coldest grains get ices,"Context. Matter that falls onto a protoplanetary disk (PPD) from a protostellar envelope is heated before it cools again. This induces sublimation and subsequent re-adsorption of ices that accumulated during the prestellar phase. Aims. We explore the fate of ices on multiple-sized dust grains in a parcel of infalling matter. Methods. A comprehensive kinetic chemical model using five grain-size bins with different temperatures was applied for an infalling parcel. The parcel was heated to 150 K and then cooled over a total timescale of 20 kyr. Effects on ice loss and re-accumulation by the changed gas density, the maximum temperature, the irradiation intensity, the size-dependent grain temperature trend, and the distribution of the ice mass among the grain-size bins were investigated. Results. A massive selective redistribution of ices exclusively onto the surface of the coldest grain-size bin occurs in all models. The redistribution starts already during the heating stage, where ices that are sublimated from warmer grains re-adsorb onto colder grains before complete sublimation. During the cooling stage, the sublimated molecules re-freeze again onto the coldest grains. In the case of full sublimation, this re-adsorption is delayed and occurs at lower temperatures because a bare grain surface has lower molecular desorption energies in our model. Conclusions. Most protostellar envelope grains enter the PPD ice poor (bare). Ices are carried by a single coldest grain-size bin, here representing 12 % of the total grain surface area. This bare ice-grain dualism can affect the rate of the grain coagulation. The ice components are stratified on the grains according to their sublimation temperatures.",['Juris Kalvāns'],5.0,11.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15609,Astrophysics of Galaxies,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",A&A,,['astrochemistry – molecular processes – protoplanetary dis ks – planets and satellites: formation – interstellar mediu m: dust – stars: formation 1'],2025-01-28
Repeated pattern of $\gamma$-ray flares in the blazar PKS 1502+106 coincident with the IC190730A neutrino event,"It has been demonstrated that at least 10 percent of the brightest blazars in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources exhibit repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares. These events may be associated with the presence of a non-uniform sheath surrounding a fast jet spine in some blazars. Theoretical models suggest that such a sheath could facilitate neutrino production in these structured jets. We aim to test the previously reported marginal statistical evidence for a connection between repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares in blazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with these sources. We identified a repeating pattern of flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the blazar PKS 1502+106, which lies within the 50\% uncertainty region of the IC190730A neutrino candidate event. This occurrence is combined with two other high-energy ($\ge 200$ TeV) neutrino events from ICECAT-1 that arrived in both positional and temporal coincidence with two blazars exhibiting ongoing repeating flare patterns.

"Characterization of of (98943) 2001 CC$_{21}$, the target of Hayabusa2$\#$","The near-Earth asteroid (98943) Torifune, previously designated 2001 CC$_{21}$, is the flyby target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, nicknamed Hayabusa2$\#$ (SHARP: Small Hazardous Asteroid Reconnaissance Probe). The ground-based telescope observations offer a key science input for the mission's scientific investigation. During 2022 - 2024 this asteroid was at visible apparent magnitudes brighter than 18.5, allowing for a detailed characterization using ground-based telescope observations. We determined its rotation period $P~=~5.021516\pm0.000106$ h and its absolute magnitude H = 18.78 $\pm$ 0.14 and. The large number of lightcurves allows to estimate its axes ratio, its convex shape and its pole orientation $\lambda = 301^{\circ} \pm 35^{\circ}$, $\beta = {89^{+1}_{-6}}^{\circ}$ and $\epsilon = 5^{\circ} \pm 3^{\circ}$ which indicate a prograde rotation. We report the semi-axis of the equivalent ellipsoid, $a$ = 0.42$^{+0.08}_{0.06}$ km, $b$ = 0.16$^{+0.05}_{0.04}$ km, and $c$ = $0.17\pm0.03$ km. Consequently, the volume equivalent diameter is $D_{eq}$ = $0.44 \pm 0.06$ km . Using observations conducted simultaneously with four broadband filters, we determined $(g-r) = 0.663 \pm 0.022$ mag, $(r-i) = 0.177 \pm 0.012$ mag, and $(i-z_s) = -0.061 \pm 0.032$ mag. Additionally, we found that Torifune exhibits no detectable large-scale heterogeneity. We classified the object using a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum (over the visible and near-infrared region) as Sq-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. We estimate a mineralogy similar to LL/L ordinary chondrites, with an ol/(ol+px) = 0.60, a Fa content of 28.5 mol$\%$, and a Fs content of 23.4 mol$\%$. The spectral data indicate a surface affected by moderate space weathering effects.","['Marcel M. Popescu', 'Eri Tatsumi', 'Javier Licandro', 'Miguel R.

Discovering Strong Gravitational Lenses in the Dark Energy Survey with Interactive Machine Learning and Crowd-sourced Inspection with Space Warps,"We conduct a search for strong gravitational lenses in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 imaging data. We implement a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for our machine learning (ML) architecture and adopt Interactive Machine Learning to construct a training sample with multiple classes to address common types of false positives. Our ML model reduces 236 million DES cutout images to 22,564 targets of interest, including around 85% of previously reported galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in DES. These targets were visually inspected by citizen scientists, who ruled out approximately 90% as false positives. Of the remaining 2,618 candidates, 149 were expert-classified as 'definite' lenses and 516 as 'probable' lenses, with 147 of these candidates being newly identified. Additionally, we trained a second ViT to find double-source plane lens systems, finding at least one double-source system. Our main ViT excels at identifying galaxy-galaxy lenses, consistently assigning high scores to candidates with high confidence. The top 800 ViT-scored images include around 100 of our `definite' lens candidates. This selection is an order of magnitude higher in purity than previous convolutional neural network-based lens searches and demonstrates the feasibility of applying our methodology for discovering large samples of lenses in future surveys.","['J.

"Numerical Study of Solar Eruption, EUV Wave Propagation, and Wave-Induced Prominence Dynamics","Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of horizontal extent of 1100 Mm while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC 3.1 code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form the flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasicircular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing equipartition lines where the Alfvén speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors, with the fast EUV wave slightly decelerating as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.","['Valeriia Liakh', 'Rony Keppens']",17.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15697,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,"['prominences – Sun: oscillations – methods: numerical 1', 'Sun: corona – Sun: filaments']",2025-01-28
Studying the Power Sources Behind Type Ic Supernovae,"Astrophysical transients can be powered by a broad range of energy sources including shock-heating (internal and external shocks), decay of radioactive isotopes, and long-lived central engines (magnetar and fallback). The dominant energy source for astrophysical transients depends on the nature of the explosive engine and its progenitor. To model all transients, light-curve codes must include all of these energy sources. Here we present a supernova light-curve code implementing analytic source models to compare the role of different energy sources in these transients. To demonstrate the utility of this code, we conduct an extensive study of type Ic broad-line supernovae. A diverse set of energy sources have been linked to Ic broad-line supernovae making them an excellent candidate for this light-curve code. In this paper, we explore which features of the explosion (mass, velocity, etc.) affect the type Ic supernovae light-curves, focusing on shock-interaction and radioactive decay energy sources. Although the explosion properties under both energy sources can be tuned to match the peak emission, matching the light-curve evolution in many Ic broad-line supernovae requires fine-tuned conditions. We find that shock interactions in the stellar wind are likely to be the dominant energy source at peak for these supernovae.","['Annabelle E. Niblett', 'Daniel A. Fryer', 'Christopher L.

Uncertainties in the Hubble Constant from Peculiar Velocities,"Recent measurements of the Hubble constant using type Ia supernovae explicitly correct for their estimated peculiar velocities using the 2M++ reconstruction of the local density field. The amount of uncertainty from this reconstruction procedure has thus far been unquantified. To rectify this, we use mock universe realisations of the 2M++ catalogue and generate predicted peculiar velocities using the same method as the predictions that are used to correct for the Pantheon+ catalogue. We find that the method yields uncertainties of 0.3 km/s/Mpc and hence subdominant to the total uncertainty in H0.","['Amber M. Hollinger', 'Michael J.

Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters of AGN Host Galaxies within $z < 1.4$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey,"We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z<1.4$ and $m<23$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift bins: low ($0<z<0.25$), mid ($0.25<z<0.5$), high ($0.5<z<0.9$), extra ($0.9<z<1.1$) and extreme ($1.1<z<1.4$), and train our models independently in each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.","['Chuan Tian', 'C.

The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): Complete Size Distributions for the 100 Brightest Disks Across Multiplicity and SED Classes,"The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d $\sim$ 140-200 pc). We present the complete continuum size distribution for the $105$ brightest protoplanetary disks (M$_{\text{dust}}$ $\gtrsim$ 2 M$_{\oplus}$) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (7 au) to 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources, providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling $68\%$ of the flux ($R_{68\%}$) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal with a median value of $\sim$14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation $\sigma_{\log} = 0.46$ (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems ($<$ 200 au separation) have smaller radii, with median value of $\sim$5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age $\lesssim$ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age $\sim$ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.","['Anuroop Dasgupta', 'Lucas A.

Precision Analysis of $\mathrm{^{12}C / ^{13}C}$ Ratios in Orion IRc2 Acetylene Isotopologues via $\chi^2$ Fitting,"We present a detailed analysis of acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and its isotopologues in the Orion IRc2 region, focusing on the determination of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios using high-resolution infrared spectra from SOFIA. By employing a robust $\chi^2$ fitting method, we simultaneously determined temperature and column density, achieving a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $18.72^{+1.54}_{-1.46}$ for the blue clump and $15.07^{+1.61}_{-1.60}$ for the red clump. These results revealed significant discrepancies with the traditional rotational diagram method, which overestimated the ratios by 12.1% and 23.9%, respectively. Our $\chi^2$ approach also reduced uncertainties by up to 80% , providing more precise and reliable isotopic ratios. Additionally, we extended the analysis to isotopologues not covered in HITRAN, calculating vibrational and rotational constants through quantum chemical calculations. This allowed us to model subtle isotopic shifts induced by $^{13}$C and deuterium substitution, enabling accurate isotopologue detection in astrophysical environments. The Python package developed in this study facilitates efficient $\chi^2$ fitting and isotopic ratio analysis, making it a valuable tool for future high-resolution observations.

Effects of Thermodynamics on the Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Gas Giants in Protoplanetary Disks,"Accretion and migration usually proceeds concurrently for giant planet formation in the natal protoplanetary disks. Recent works indicate that the concurrent accretion onto a giant planet imposes significant impact on the planetary migration dynamics in the isothermal regime. In this work, we carry out a series of 2D global hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++ to explore the effect of thermodynamics on the concurrent accretion and migration process of the planets in a self-consistent manner. The thermodynamics effect is modeled with a thermal relaxation timescale using a $\beta$-cooling prescription. Our results indicate that radiative cooling has a substantial effect on the accretion and migration processes of the planet. As cooling timescales increase, we observe a slight decrease in the planetary accretion rate, and a transition from the outward migrating into inward migration. This transition occurs approximately when the cooling timescale is comparable to the local dynamical timescale ($\beta\sim1$), which is closely linked to the asymmetric structures from the circumplanetary disk (CPD) region. The asymmetric structures in the CPD region which appear with an efficient cooling provide a strong positive torque driving the planet migrate outward. However, such a positive torque is strongly suppressed, when the CPD structures tend to disappear with a relatively long cooling timescale ($\beta\gtrsim10$). Our findings may also be relevant to the dynamical evolution of accreting stellar-mass objects embedded in disks around active galactic nuclei.","['Hening Wu', 'Ya-ping Li']",9.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15874,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,"Universe 2025, 11(1), 1","['Planet-disk interactions', 'Accretion', 'Protoplanetary disks', 'Extrasolar gas giants', 'Black holes 0']",2025-01-28
Precession for the mode change in a gamma-ray pulsar,"PSR J2021+4026 is a gamma-ray pulsar having variations in its spin-down rate and gamma-ray flux. Its variations in timing and emission are correlated, e.g., a larger spin-down rate for a low gamma-ray flux. We show that the mode change in PSR J2021+4026 can be understood in the precession scenario. In the precession model, the inclination angle is modulated due to precession. At the same time, the wobble angle may decay with time. This results in damping of the precession. Combined with magnetospheric torque model and the outer gap model, the damped precession can explain: (1) when the inclination angle is larger, the spin-down rate will be larger, accompanied by a lower gamma-ray flux. (2) The variation amplitude of the gamma-ray flux and spin-down rate is smaller than previous results due to the damping of the precession. The modulation period is becoming shorter due to a smaller wobble angle. In the end, we propose that there are two kinds of modulations in pulsars. Long-term modulations in pulsars may be due to precession. Short-term modulations may be of magnetospheric origin.","['H. Tong', 'H. H.

Evolution of neutron stars in wide eccentric low-mass binary systems,"Precise astrometric measurement with Gaia satellite resulted in the discovery of tens of wide binary systems consisting of a Sun-like star and an invisible component. The latter can be a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. In this paper, we model magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries accounting for the orbital eccentricity. We aim to calculate when neutron stars in such systems can start to accrete matter from the stellar wind of the companion. We show that the transition from the ejector to the propeller stage occurs earlier in more eccentric systems, thus increasing the time that neutron stars can spend accreting matter. Our calculations show that in the case of efficient spin-down at the propeller stage, a neutron star in an eccentric orbit with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and a standard magnetic field $B=10^{12}$ G can start accreting within a few Gyr. For neutron stars with $B=10^{13}$ G the onset of accretion occurs earlier regardless of the orbital eccentricity. Otherwise, with a lower spin-down rate, such a neutron star will remain at the propeller stage for most of its life.","['Marina Afonina', 'Sergei Popov']",6.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15918,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,"['neutron stars', 'binary stars', 'accretion 1', 'magnetic field']",2025-01-28
Icarus 3.0: Dynamic Heliosphere Modelling,"Space weather predictions are necessary to avoid damage caused by intense geomagnetic storms. Such strong storms are usually caused by a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) passing at Earth or by the arrival of strong coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To mitigate the damage, the effect of propagating CMEs in the solar wind must be estimated accurately at Earth and other locations. Modelling solar wind accurately is crucial for space weather predictions, as it is the medium for CME propagation. The Icarus heliospheric modelling tool is upgraded to handle dynamic inner heliospheric driving instead of using steady boundary conditions. The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and the automated grid-adaptivity are adjusted to the latest MPI-AMRVAC version. The inner boundary conditions, prescribed at 0.1 AU for the heliospheric model, are updated time-dependently throughout the simulation. The coronal model is computed repeatedly for selected magnetograms. The particle sampling within MPI-AMRVAC is extended to handle stretched spherical grid information. The solar wind obtained in the simulation is dynamic and shows significant variations throughout the evolution. When comparing the results with the observations, the dynamic solar wind results are more accurate than previous results obtained with purely steady boundary driving. The CMEs propagated through the dynamic solar wind background produce more similar signatures in the time-series data than in the steady solar wind. Dynamic boundary driving in Icarus results in a more self-consistent solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere. The obtained space weather modelling tool for dynamic solar wind and CME simulations is better suited for space weather forecasting than a steady solar wind model.","['Tinatin Baratashvili', 'Beatrice Popescu Braileanu', 'Fabio Bacchini', 'Rony Keppens', 'Stefaan Poedts']",8.0,10.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15923,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Computational Physics', 'Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,['Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)'],2025-01-28
Disks around young free-floating planetary-mass objects: Ultradeep Spitzer imaging of IC348,"Protoplanetary disks have been found around free-floating objects with masses comparable to those of giant planets. The frequency and properties of these disks around planetary-mass objects are still debated. Here we present ultradeep mid-infrared images for the young cluster IC348, obtained through stacking of time series images from Spitzer. We measure fluxes at 3.6 and 4.5 microns for known free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs, spectral type M9 or later) in this cluster. By comparing the observed infrared spectral energy distributions with photospheric templates, we identify six planetary-mass objects with disks, plus three which may or may not have a disk. This corresponds to a disk fraction of 46% (34-59%). The disk fraction among planetary-mass objects is comparable to more massive brown dwarfs. We show the disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects as a function of age, demonstrating that these objects retain disks for several million years, similar to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.","['Holly Hanbee Seo', 'Aleks Scholz']",5.0,7.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15930,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Astrophysics of Galaxies']",,,"['protoplanetary discs – (stars:) brown dwarfs – stars: formation 1 INTRODUCTION ItisnowcommonknowledgethatourGalaxyhostsalargenumberof brown dwarfs (perhaps 100 billion altogether', 'Mužić et al']",2025-01-28
Laboratory rotational spectroscopy leads to the first interstellar detection of singly deuterated methyl mercaptan (CH$_{2}$DSH),"We report an extensive rotational spectroscopic analysis of singly deuterated methyl mercaptan (CH$_{2}$DSH) using both millimeter and far-infrared synchrotron spectra to achieve a global torsional analysis of the three lowest torsional substates (e$_{0}$, e$_{1}$, and o$_{1}$) of this non-rigid species. A fit including 3419 millimeter wave transitions along with 43 infrared torsional subband centers was performed with root mean square deviations of 0.233 MHz and 0.270 cm$^{-1}$, respectively, resulting in 68 fit parameters. A spectroscopic catalogue built from this analysis for a temperature of 125 K has led to the first interstellar detection of CH$_{2}$DSH towards the Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B. We report the identification of 46 transitions, including eight relatively unblended lines, resulting in a derived column density of (3.0$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density ratio for HDCS/CH$_{2}$DSH compared to HDCO/CH$_{2}$DOH suggests a difference in the interstellar chemistry between the sulphur and oxygen complex organics, in particular a different link between H$_{2}$CO and CH$_{3}$OH and between H$_{2}$CS and CH$_{3}$SH.

Mass of particles released by comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during 2023-2024 outbursts,"During its most recent return, comet 12P/Pons-Brooks experienced 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from $4.26\,$au to $0.85\,$au. After perihelion, the comet experienced two additional outbursts between June and August 31, 2024, at heliocentric distances of $1.20\,$au and $2.26\,$au, respectively. Using observational data, we developed a numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on the sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors affecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active surface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's law was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering cross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the mass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass ejected during these outbursts ranges from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg. Our findings highlight the significant role of surface morphology and thermodynamic conditions in cometary outbursts, providing insights into the mechanisms driving these phenomena and their implications for cometary evolution and dust trail formation.

The Extraordinary Long-lasting Infrared Echo of PS16dtm Reveals an Extremely Energetic Nuclear Outburst,"PS16dtm is one of the earliest reported candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and displays a remarkably bright and long-lived infrared (IR) echo revealed by multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). After a rapid rise in the first year, the echo remains persistently at a high state from July 2017 to July 2024, the latest epoch, and keeps an almost constant color. We have fitted the extraordinary IR emission with a refined dust echo model by taking into account the dust sublimation process. The fitting suggests that an extremely giant dust structure with a new inner radius of $\sim1.6$ pc and an ultra-high peak bolometric luminosity, i.e., $\sim6\times10^{46} \rm erg~s^{-1}$ for typical 0.1$\mu$m-sized silicate grain, is required to account for the IR echo. This work highlights the distinctive value of IR echoes in measuring the accurate intrinsic bolometric luminosity, and thus the total radiated energy of TDEs, which could be severely underestimated by traditional methods, i.e. probably by more than an order of magnitude in PS16dtm. Such large energetic output compared to normal TDEs could be boosted by the pre-existing accretion disk and gas clouds around the black hole.

The prototype double-faced white dwarf has a thin hydrogen layer across its entire surface,"Some white dwarfs undergo significant changes in atmospheric composition owing to the diffusion and mixing of residual hydrogen in a helium-rich envelope. Of particular interest are a few objects exhibiting hydrogen and helium line variations modulated by rotation, revealing surface composition inhomogeneities. Recently, the hot ultramassive white dwarf ZTF J203349.80+322901.1 emerged as the most extreme such specimen, with hydrogen and helium lines successively appearing and vanishing in anti-phase, suggesting a peculiar double-faced configuration. However, standard atmosphere models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum at all rotation phases, hampering further interpretation. Here, we perform a new analysis of ZTF J203349.80+322901.1 using stratified atmosphere models, where hydrogen floats above helium, and obtain excellent fits to the phase-resolved spectra. Our results imply that an extremely thin hydrogen layer covers the entire surface but varies from optically thick to optically thin across the surface, thus producing the observed spectral variations. We present new envelope models indicating that the hydrogen layer arises from a delicate interplay between diffusion and convection. We discuss possible explanations for the surface layer asymmetry, including an asymmetric magnetic field and a non-uniform internal hydrogen distribution. Finally, we highlight implications for expanding and understanding the emerging class of inhomogeneous white dwarfs.","['Antoine Bédard', 'Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay']",4.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16021,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['stars: abundances – stars: atmospheres – stars: evolution – stars: individual: ZTFJ203349'],2025-01-28
Mass and Metal Flows in Isolated IllustrisTNG Halos,"The cicumgalactic medium (CGM) is a reservoir of metals and star-forming fuel. Most baryons in the universe are in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or intergalactic medium (IGM). The baryon cycle -- how mass and metals reach the CGM from the inner regions of the galaxy and how gas from the CGM replenishes star-forming activity in the inner regions -- is an essential question in galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the flow of mass and metals in a stacked sample of 2770 isolated halos from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The mean gas flow as a function of radius and angle is similar across a large galactic mass range when accounting for different feedback modes. Although both star formation and black holes cause powerful outflows, the flows from star formation are more angularly restricted. Black hole feedback dominates massflow throughout the halo, while star-formation feedback mainly affects the inner region. When scaling by virial radius ($R_v$), large dynamical changes occur at $0.2R_v$ for most halos, suggesting a characteristic size for the inner galaxy. Despite radio mode feedback from black holes being the primary quenching mechanism in IllustrisTNG, a small population of high mass radio mode disks are able to form stars.","['Jacob P.

Stratospheric Balloon Payloads for Astronomy: the challenge of coping with rising complexity,"Stratospheric balloons offer cost-effective access to space and grant the opportunity for fast scientific innovation cycles and higher-risk explorations. In addition to science pathfinders, they serve as platforms for technology advancement, and offer a unique opportunity to train future instrument scientists and PIs. However, the increase in complexity of some projects (sub-arcsecond pointing, numerous degrees of freedom, advanced cooling systems, real-time communication and data transfer, low readiness level technologies, etc.) elevates the scale of challenges. This paper discusses the challenges brought by the increase of instrument complexity in the constrained area of ballooning projects. We use the example of the multi-object slit UV spectrograph FIREBall-2 but also discuss other ambitious payloads to expose some lessons learned. We will then propose strategies for future balloon projects and potential interesting adaptations for funding agencies to accommodate these emerging complexities. The objective being to foster the added value of more ambitious balloon-borne projects, and to initiate discussion about how to generate more robust strategies for handling high-complexity undertakings. Although this paper is enriched by answers from a survey sent to balloon-borne payload PIs, it remains influenced by my personal experience on FIREBall-2. As such, it does not necessarily represent the perspectives of other members of the project, let alone the broader balloon community.",['Vincent Picouet'],5.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16047,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,26th ESA Symposium on European ROCKET & BALLOON programmes and related research (2024),[],2025-01-28
The Observed Luminosity Correlations of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Their Applications,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous electromagnetic transients in the universe, providing unique insights into extreme astrophysical processes and serving as promising probes for cosmology. Unlike Type Ia supernovae, which have a unified explosion mechanism, GRBs cannot directly act as standard candles for tracing cosmic evolution at high redshifts due to significant uncertainties in their underlying physical origins. Empirical correlations derived from statistical analyses involving various GRB parameters provide valuable information regarding their intrinsic properties. In this brief review, we describe various correlations among GRB parameters involving the prompt and afterglow phases, discussing possible theoretical interpretations behind them. The scarcity of low-redshift GRBs poses a major obstacle to the application of GRB empirical correlations in cosmology, referred to as the circularity problem. We present various efforts aiming at calibrating GRBs to address this challenge and leveraging established empirical correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. The pivotal role of GRB sample quality in advancing cosmological research is underscored. Some correlations that could potentially be utilized as redshift indicators are also introduced.","['Chen Deng', 'Yong-Feng Huang', 'Fan Xu', 'Abdusattar Kurban']",2.0,31.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16058,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma ray bursts'],2025-01-28
Grain Alignment and Dust Evolution Physics with Polarisation (GRADE-POL). I. Dust Polarisation Modelling for Isolated Starless Cores,"The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Here, we aim to test the MRAT mechanism in starless cores using the multiwavelength polarisation from optical/NIR to far-IR/submm. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\rm ext}/A_{\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\propto A^{-1}_{\rm V}$ at large $A_{\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\rm loss}_{\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core Pipe-109, our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\,\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\,\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimeter ($850\,\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.","['Le Ngoc Tram', 'Thiem Hoang', 'Alex Lazarian', 'Daniel Seifried', 'B-G Andersson', 'Thushara G.S.

Thermal instability of thin disk in the presence of wind and corona,"This study investigates the thermal stability of thin accretion disks in high-energy astrophysical systems, incorporating the effects of magnetic fields, winds, and coronae. We analyze how these factors influence disk stability, focusing on conditions under which magnetic fields enhance stability and on scenarios where winds and coronae can either stabilize or destabilize the disk. Our results reveal that increasing corona parameters raises disk thickness and reduces temperature, thereby affecting gas, radiation, and magnetic pressures. These interactions underscore the complex dependencies that shape accretion disk dynamics, offering insights into their structural and thermal behavior under varying physical conditions. The findings contribute to advancing theoretical models and numerical simulations of accretion processes in environments such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries, where disk stability plays a critical role in observed emissions and variability patterns.","['Arezoo Tajmohamadi', 'Shahram Abbassi']",8.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16087,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,Journal if High Energy Astrophysics,,"['Neutron Stars', 'Black Holes', 'Accr etion Disks 1', 'High Energy Astrophysics']",2025-01-28
Gamma rays from star clusters and implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays,"Context. Star clusters are often invoked as contributors to the flux of Galactic cosmic rays and as sources potentially able to accelerate particles to $\sim$PeV energies. The gamma radiation with $E\gtrsim$ TeV recently observed from selected star clusters has profound implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.Aims. We show that if the gamma rays observed from the Cygnus cocoon and Westerlund 1 are of hadronic origin, then the cosmic rays escaping the cluster at energies $\gtrsim$ 10 TeV must cross a grammage inside the cluster that exceeds the Galactic grammage. At lower energies, depending on the model adopted to describe the production of gamma rays, such grammage may exceed or be comparable with the grammage inferred from propagation on Galactic scales.Methods. The flux of gamma rays is analytically computed for a few models of injection of cosmic rays in star clusters, and compared with the flux measured from selected clusters.Results. In all models considered here, comparing the inferred and observed gamma ray fluxes at $E\gtrsim$ TeV, we conclude that CRs must traverse a large grammage inside or around the cluster before escaping. Clearly these implications would not apply to a scenario in which gamma rays are produced due to radiative losses of leptons in the cluster. Leptonic models typically require weaker magnetic fields, which in turn result in maximum energies of accelerated particles much below $\sim$ PeV.Conclusions. We conclude that if gamma ray emission in SCs is a generic phenomenon and if this radiation is due to hadronic interactions, either star clusters cannot contribute but a small fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at the Earth, or their contribution to the grammage cannot be neglected and the paradigm of Galactic transport should be profoundly revisited.",['Pasquale Blasi'],1.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16097,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,['cosmic rays – star clusters – acceleration of particles – shock waves 1'],2025-01-28
Search for H2 cloudlets in our backyard,"Several observational lines of evidence imply that a fraction of the dark matter in the Galaxy may be comprised of small cold clouds of molecular hydrogen. Such objects are difficult to detect because of their small size and low temperature, but they can reveal themselves with gamma radiation arising in interactions between such clouds and cosmic rays or as dark shadows cast on the optical, UV and X-ray sky background. In our work we use the data of Fermi LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalogue of gamma-ray sources together with the data of GALEX UV All-Sky Survey to search for small dark clouds of molecular hydrogen in the Solar neighbourhood. This approach allows us to put an upper limit on the local concentration of such objects: $n < 2.2 \times 10^{-11} {\mathrm{AU}^{-3}}$. Constraints (upper limits) on the total amount of matter in this form bound to the Sun strongly depend on the radial profile of the clouds' distribution and reside in $0.05-30~M_{\odot}$ mass range.","['A.V.

\texttt{BrahMap}: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments,"The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity.

E-INSPIRE -- I. Bridging the gap with the local Universe: Stellar population of a statistical sample of ultra-compact massive galaxies at $z<0.3$,"This paper presents the first effort to Extend the Investigation of Stellar Populations In RElics (E-INSPIRE). We present a catalogue of 430 spectroscopically-confirmed ultra-compact massive galaxies (UCMGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts $0.01<z<0.3$. This increases the original INSPIRE sample eightfold, bridging the gap with the local Universe. For each object, we compute integrated stellar velocity dispersion, age, metallicity, and [Mg/Fe] through spectroscopic stellar population analysis. We infer star formation histories (SFHs), metallicity evolution histories (MEHs) and compute the Degree of Relicness (DoR) of each object. The UCMGs, covering a wide range of DoR from 0.05 to 0.88, can be divided into three groups, according to how extreme their SFH was. The first group consists of 81 extreme relics ($\text{DoR}\gtrsim0.6$) that have formed the totality of their stellar mass by $z\sim2$ and have super-solar metallicities at all cosmic epochs. The second group ($0.3\lesssim\text{DoR}\lesssim0.6$) contains 293 objects also characterised by peaked SFHs but with a small percentage of later-formed stars and with a variety of MEHs. The third group ($\text{DoR}\lesssim0.3$), has 56 objects that cannot be considered relics since they have extended SFHs and formed a non-negligible fraction ($>25\%$) of their stellar mass at $z<2$. We confirm that an efficient method of finding relics is to select UCMGs with large velocity dispersion values but we believe that the most efficient way is to select high velocity dispersion objects that also have super-solar metallicities and high [Mg/Fe].","['John Mills', 'Chiara Spiniello', 'Alexey Sergeyev', 'Crescenzo Tortora', 'Vladyslav Khramtsov', ""Giuseppe D'Ago"", 'Michalina Maksymowicz-Maciata', 'João P.

Wave instruments on STEREO and on Cassini during its cruise phase detected a highly variable flux of fast nanodust.

"Measuring the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation at $\sim10^{10}$ Solar masses, using space-based imaging of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses","The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) embodies the joint evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter halos. However, the relation is poorly constrained at sub-galactic masses, because the stellar emission from such objects is so faint. However, it is possible to directly detect the mass of halos along the line of sight to a strong gravitational lens, when they perturb one of its multiple images. Space telescopes including Euclid, CSST, and Roman will soon discover millions of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems. We simulate Euclid-like imaging of a typical lens galaxy, and find that a lensing reconstruction is sensitive to $3\times10^{10}$ subhalos with various positions and concentrations, at statistical signficance $>$$3.6\sigma$. The subhalo mass can be measured without bias, provided the model simultaneously fits light from both the main lens and the subhalo. A future sample of 48 subhalos with $\geqslant$$5\sigma$ detection significance would constrain the SHMR at this mass range with $1\sigma$ uncertainty of 0.045 dex: distinguishing between different theoretical predictions at the sub-galactic scale. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to measure lens and source redshifts; follow-up imaging at greater spatial resolution and depth would substantially improve the measurement, and eliminate false-positives at even lower halo masses.","['Kaihao Wang', 'Xiaoyue Cao', 'Ran Li', 'James W.

Breaking the degeneracy in stellar spectral classification from single wide-band images,"The spectral energy distribution (SED) of observed stars in wide-field images is crucial for chromatic point spread function (PSF) modelling methods, which use unresolved stars as integrated spectral samples of the PSF across the field of view. This is particularly important for weak gravitational lensing studies, where precise PSF modelling is essential to get accurate shear measurements. Previous research has demonstrated that the SED of stars can be inferred from low-resolution observations using machine-learning classification algorithms. However, a degeneracy exists between the PSF size, which can vary significantly across the field of view, and the spectral type of stars, leading to strong limitations of such methods. We propose a new SED classification method that incorporates stellar spectral information by using a preliminary PSF model, thereby breaking this degeneracy and enhancing the classification accuracy. Our method involves calculating a set of similarity features between an observed star and a preliminary PSF model at different wavelengths and applying a support vector machine to these similarity features to classify the observed star into a specific stellar class. The proposed approach achieves a 91\% top-two accuracy, surpassing machine-learning methods that do not consider the spectral variation of the PSF. Additionally, we examined the impact of PSF modelling errors on the spectral classification accuracy.","['Ezequiel Centofanti', 'Samuel Farrens', 'Jean-Luc Starck', 'Tobias Liaudat', 'Alex Szapiro', 'Jennifer Pollack']",12.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16151,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,['Stellar classification – Point spread function – Machine learning 1'],2025-01-28

Quantifying the Impact of the Dust Torque on the Migration of Low-mass Planets II: The Role of Pebble Accretion in Planet Growth within a Global Planet Formation Model,"Although dust constitutes only about 1% of the mass of a protoplanetary disk, recent studies demonstrate that it can exert a significant torque on low- and intermediate-mass planetary cores. We compute and quantify for the first time the influence of the dust torque on the evolution of growing planetary embryos as they move in a protoplanetary disk while growing via gas and pebble accretion. Our global model evolves the gaseous disk via viscous accretion and X-ray photoevaporation, while accounting for dust growth and evolution including coagulation, drift, and fragmentation. Our research indicates that dust torque significantly influences planetary migration, particularly driving substantial outward migration for planets forming within the water ice-line. This effect occurs due to an increased dust-to-gas mass ratio in the inner disk, resulting from inward pebble drift from outer regions. In contrast, for planets initially located beyond the water ice-line, the dust torque mitigates inward migration but does not significantly alter their paths, as the dust-to-gas ratio diminishes rapidly due to rapid pebble drift and the brief timescales of planet formation in these areas. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dust torque in shaping the migration patterns of low- and intermediate-mass planets, especially when enhanced dust concentrations in the inner disk amplify its effects","['Octavio M.

Location and energy of electrons producing the radio bursts from AD Leo observed by FAST in December 2021,"In a recent paper, we presented circularly polarized radio bursts detected by the radio telescope FAST from the flare star AD Leo on December 2-3, 2021, which were attributed to the electron cyclotron maser instability. In that context we use here two independent and complementary approaches\pz{, inspired from the study of auroral radio emissions from solar system planets,} to constrain for the first time the source location (magnetic shell, height) and the energy of the emitting electrons. These two approaches consist of (i) modeling the overall occurrence of the emission with the ExPRES code, and (ii) fitting the drift-rate of the fine structures observed by FAST. We obtain consistent results pointing at 20-30 keV electrons on magnetic shells with apex at 2-10 stellar radii. Emission polarization observed by FAST and magnetic topology of AD Leo favour X-mode emission from the southern magnetic hemisphere, from which we draw constraints on the plasma density scale height in the star's atmosphere.

Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster II. Stellar kinematics and dynamical masses,"Context: This paper focuses on a class of galaxies characterised by an extremely low surface brightness: the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We used new integral-field spectroscopic data from the ESO Large Programme Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS) project. Aims: Our main goals are addressing the formation channels and investigating possible correlations of their observational properties. In particular, we derive their stellar kinematics and dynamical properties. Methods: We extract the 1D stacked spectrum inside the effective radius to obtain an unbiased measure of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$. To derive the spatially-resolved stellar kinematics, we first apply the Voronoi tessellation algorithm to bin the spaxels in the datacube and then follow the same prescription adopted for the 1D case. In addition, we extract the velocity profiles along the galaxy's major and minor axes. Results: We find that 7 out of 18 UDGs in LEWIS show a mild rotation, 5 do not have evidence of any rotation, and the remaining 6 UDGs are unconstrained cases. This is the first large census of velocity profiles for UDGs. On average, UDGs in LEWIS are characterised by low values of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$, comparable with available values from the literature. In the Faber-Jackson relation plane, we found a group of UDGs consistent with the relation within the errorbars, whereas outliers are objects with non-negligible rotation components. UDGs and LSBs in LEWIS have larger dark matter content than dwarf galaxies with similar total luminosity. We do not find clear correlations between the derived properties and the local environment. Conclusions: Based on the stellar kinematics, two classes of UDGs are found in the Hydra I cluster: the rotating and non-rotating systems. This result, combined with other structural properties, can help to discriminate between the several formation scenarios proposed for UDGs.","['Chiara Buttitta', 'Enrichetta Iodice', 'Goran Doll', 'Johanna Hartke', 'Michael Hilker', 'Duncan A.

Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster III. Untangling UDG 32 from the stripped filaments of NGC 3314A with multi-wavelength data,"UDG 32 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the Hydra I cluster that was discovered in the extended network of stellar filaments of the jellyfish galaxy NGC 3314A. This galaxy is affected by ram pressure stripping and it is hypothesised that UDG 32 may have formed from its stripped material. In this paper, we address whether UDG 32 can be associated with the stripped material of NGC 3314A and constrain its formation scenario in relation to its environment. We use new integral-field spectroscopic data from the MUSE large programme `LEWIS' in conjunction with deep multi-band photometry to constrain the kinematics and stellar populations of UDG 32. The new MUSE data allow us to reveal that the stripped material from NGC 3314A, traced by emission lines such as H$\alpha$, extends much further from its parent galaxy than previously known, completely overlapping with UDG 32 in projection, and with ram pressure induced star formation. We determine the line-of-sight velocity of UDG 32 ($v_{\rm LOS} = 3080\pm120$ km/s) and confirm that UDG 32 is part of the same kinematic structure as NGC 3314A, the Hydra I cluster south-east subgroup. By fitting the UV and optical spectral energy distribution, we constrain the stellar population properties of UDG 32. We determine its mass-weighted age to be $7.7^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$ Gyr and its metallicity to be [M/H] = $0.07^{+0.19}_{-0.32}$ dex. We confirm the presence of two globular clusters (GCs) in the MUSE field of view, bound to the Hydra I cluster rather than to UDG 32, thus part of the Hydra I intracluster GC population. The metal-rich and intermediate-age nature of UDG 32 points towards its formation from pre-enriched material in the south-east group of the Hydra I cluster that was liberated from a more massive galaxy via tidal or ram-pressure stripping, but we cannot establish a direct link to the ram-pressure stripped material from NGC 3314A.","['J.

Completion of Lunar Magma Ocean Solidification at 4.43 Ga,"Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean yielded a chemically unique liquid residuum named KREEP. This component is expressed as a large patch on the near side of the Moon, and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10 and 200 Myr, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded inconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160 Myr. Here, we show that the Moon achieved over 99 percent crystallization at 4429+/-76 Myr, indicating a lunar formation age of 4450 Myr or possibly older. Using the 176Lu-176Hf decay system (t1/2=37 Gyr), we found that the initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U-Pb ages are consistent with their crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low 176Lu/177Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 Myr after solar system formation. The previously proposed younger model age of 4.33 Ga for the source of mare basalts (240 Myr after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a large impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization took place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and planetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. Study of Lu-Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will help to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its significance in the early history of the Moon.","['Nicolas Dauphas', 'Zhe J.

Stability and convergence of nuclear detonations in white dwarf collisions,"We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal mass, magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature and energy limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds we find grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O WDs, multi-species compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.","['Peter Anninos', 'David Cruz-Lopez', 'Brighten Jiang', 'Emanuel Gordis']",14.0,16.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16252,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,"['nucleosynthesis 1', 'supernovae — white dwarfs — hydrodynamics — nuclear reactions']",2025-01-28
A Possible Mass Ratio and Spin-Orbit Misalignment Correlation for Mergers of Binary Black Holes in Nuclear Star Clusters,"Despite a decade's worth of gravitational wave observation, the origin of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO-VIRGO-Kagra (LVK) collaboration remains an open question. Towards assessing the feasibility and prevalence of the many proposed BBH formation channels, the spin properties of the merging black holes (BHs) hold significant promise, particularly their orientations. The combined trends of a moderate preferential alignment of BH spins with their orbit normals and an apparent correlation of BBH effective spin parameters $\chi_{\rm eff}$ with their mass ratios seem to favor hydrodynamical BBH formation mechanisms over purely dynamical ones, as they introduce a preferred orientation to the system. However, such processes are filled with physical and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we highlight a dynamical route to easily characterizable spin evolution that results in analytically-predictable spin distributions. We show that, when a stellar binary forms a BBH through two phases of stable mass transfer, and the BBH is subsequently driven to merger by the gravitational perturbation of a distant massive object (such as a supermassive black hole), the resulting spin-orbit misalignment angles are anti-correlated with the binary mass ratio. While the mechanism as proposed only operates in a somewhat narrow region of parameter space, it also predicts significantly tighter correlations than are seen in the LVK systems. We discuss avenues for future work that may significantly expand the parameter space of our mechanism while still remaining broadly consistent with observations.",['Yubo Su'],7.0,21.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16258,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-28
Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses,"Inhomogeneities along the line of sight in strong gravitational lensing distort the images produced, in an effect called shear. If measurable, this shear may provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to traditional cosmic shear. We model 50 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the `minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. We model the main deflector with an elliptical power law profile, the lens light with elliptical Sérsic profiles and the source with a basis set of shapelets and an elliptical Sérsic profile. We successfully obtain a line-of-sight shear measurement from 18 of the 50 lenses. We find that these LOS shear measurements are consistent with external shears measured in recent works using a simpler shear model, which are larger than those expected from weak lensing. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies to the LOS shear measurement, and the same effect is seen if a prior is used to connect the lens mass and light ellipticities. The inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.","['Natalie B. Hogg', 'Anowar J.

Effect of Numerical Resolution on Synthetic Observables of Simulated Coronal Loops,"Increasingly realistic simulations of the corona are used to predict synthetic observables for instruments onboard both existing and upcoming heliophysics space missions. Synthetic observables play an important role in constraining coronal heating theories. Choosing the spatial resolution of numerical simulations involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Since the numerical resolution not only affects the scale of structures that can be resolved, but also thermodynamic quantities such as the average coronal density, it is important to quantify the effect on synthesized observables. Using 3D radiative MHD simulations of coronal loops at three different grid spacings, from 60 km down to 12 km, we find that changes in numerical resolution lead to differences in thermodynamic quantities and stratification as well as dynamic behaviour. Higher grid resolution results in a more complex and dynamic atmosphere. The resolution affects the emission intensity as well as the velocity distribution, thereby affecting synthetic spectra derived from the simulation. The distribution of synthetic coronal loop strand sizes changes as more fine-scale structure is resolved. A number of parameters, however, seem to start to saturate from our chosen medium grid resolution on. Our study shows that while choosing a sufficiently high resolution matters when comparing forward-modelled observables with data from current and future space missions, for most purposes not much is gained by further increasing the resolution beyond a grid spacing of 24 km, which seems to be adequate for reproducing bulk loop properties and forward-modelled emission, representing a good trade-off between accuracy and computational resource.","['Cosima Alexandra Breu', 'Ineke De Moortel', 'Hardi Peter', 'Sami Khan Solanki']",15.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16293,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Sun:corona – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – Sun:UV radiation 1 INTRODUCTION Numerical models of coronal structures in the form of 3D magne- tohydrodynamics(MHD)simulationsmakeitpossibletosynthesize emission as it would be observed by space-based instruments and are an important tool to make predictions for ongoing and future facilities'],2025-01-28
Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy,"Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.","['A. W. Neitzel', 'T. L. Campante', 'D.

A MARVEL-ous study of how well galaxy shapes reflect Dark Matter halo shapes in Cold Dark Matter Simulations,"We present a 3D shape analysis of both dark matter (DM) and stellar matter (SM) in simulated dwarf galaxies to determine whether stellar shape traces DM shape. Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites (Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning stellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the moment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis ratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed follow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar disk in more massive dwarfs (M$_* \gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$) pulls the distribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass galaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM. Similarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality, with this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though weaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment between SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no detectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe feedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust to different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also observe that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers (with merger ratios $>4$). This comprehensive study demonstrates that stellar shape measurements can serve as a reliable tool for inferring DM shapes in dwarf galaxies.","['Blake Keith', 'Ferah Munshi', 'Alyson M.

Type I X-ray Bursts Reflected During the X-ray Eclipses of EXO 0748-676,"The neutron star X-ray binary, EXO 0748--676, was observed regularly by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and XMM-Newton during its first detected outburst (1985 - 2008). These observations captured hundreds of asymmetric, energy-dependent X-ray eclipses, influenced by the ongoing ablation of the companion star and numerous Type I thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Here, we present the light curves of 22 Type I X-ray bursts observed by RXTE that coincide, fully or partially, with an X-ray eclipse. We identify nine instances where the burst occurs entirely within totality, seven bursts split across an egress, and six cases interrupted by an ingress. All in-eclipse bursts and split bursts occurred while the source was in the hard spectral state. We establish that we are not observing direct burst emission during eclipses since the companion star and the ablated outflow entirely obscure our view of the X-ray emitting region. We determine that the reflected flux from the outer accretion disc, even if maximally flared, is insufficient to explain all observations of in-eclipse X-ray bursts and instead explore scenarios whereby the X-ray bursts are scattered, either by a burst-induced rise in $N_{\rm{H}}$ that provides extra material, an accretion disc wind or the ablated outflow into our line of sight. However, the rarity of a burst and eclipse overlap makes it challenging to determine their origin.","['Amy H. Knight', 'Jakob van den Eijnden', 'Adam Ingram', 'James H. Matthews', 'Sara E.

Weak-emission-line quasars: A new clue from their optical variability,"Weak-emission-line QSOs (WLQs) are an enigmatic subclass of the QSO population, as their optical/UV spectra are marked by abnormally weak (or absent) emission lines. To obtain much-needed additional clues to the origin of this and other known peculiarities of WLQs, we have determined the 'ensemble' optical variability characteristics for a large, well-defined sample of 76 radio-quiet WLQs and also for a matched control sample comprising 603 normal radio-quiet QSOs. This analysis was done using their light-curves recorded in the $g$ and $r$ bands, under the ZTF survey during 2018-2024, with a typical cadence of 3 days. We find that, compared to normal QSOs, WLQs exhibit systematically milder optical variability on month/year-like time scales (by a factor of $\sim$ 1.76$\pm$0.05 in amplitude). We have independently verified this by carrying out an equivalent analysis of the V-band light-curves acquired under the CRTS during 2007- 2014, with a typical cadence of 10 days. This new observational differentiator between WLQs and normal QSOs may provide clues to understanding the intriguing nature of WLQs. It is proposed that the clumpiness of the torus material flowing into the central engine may play a key role in explaining the observed differences between the WLQs and normal QSOs.","['Ritish Kumar', 'Gopal-Krishna', 'Hum Chand', 'Vibhore Negi']",6.0,6.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16328,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,"Phys.

Temporarily quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn: probing bursty star formation,"The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with $M_\star<10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6-8$, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at $M_\star<10^8\rm M_\odot$ and $M_{UV}>-17$. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint ($\langle M_{UV}\rangle = -15.6$ for $M_\star=10^{8}\rm M_\odot$), have strong Balmer breaks ($> 0.5$) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at $M_{UV}\sim-20$ to $-19$ are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity ($<5^{\prime\prime}$) of massive ($>10^{10}\rm M_\odot$) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint ($M_{UV}>-17$), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.","['Viola Gelli', 'Andrea Pallottini', 'Stefania Salvadori', 'Andrea Ferrara', 'Charlotte Mason', 'Stefano Carniani', 'Michele Ginolfi']",10.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16418,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['High-redshift galaxies — Galaxy evolution — Cosmology 1'],2025-01-29
AMICO-WL: an optimal filtering algorithm for galaxy cluster detections with weak lensing,"The detection of galaxy clusters, the most massive bounded structures in the universe, is crucial for cosmological analysis. Weak lensing signals allow us to track the distribution of all (dark and baryonic) matter regardless of its observable electromagnetic properties. Upcoming wide-field surveys like Euclid and LSST-Rubin will provide enhanced shape measurements of billions of background galaxies, presenting an unparalleled opportunity to detect galaxy clusters on a vast cosmic scale. The immense data volume generated by these surveys will require efficient and accurate analysis techniques. In this work, we introduce AMICO-WL, an extension of the optimal filtering algorithm implemented in AMICO, a well-tested code developed for optical cluster detection. AMICO-WL implements a specific linear optimal matched filter for weak lensing data in the AMICO infrastructure, using parallelisation and adding an efficient signal-to-noise ratio thresholding approach to set a desired sample purity and a cleaning procedure to deal with blended detections. The algorithm has been tested on a 25 deg$^2$ field of Euclid-like mock galaxy catalogue with the simulated shear signal produced using DUSTGRAIN-$pathfinder$ past-light-cones. We implemented a foreground removal procedure based on different cuts of low redshift galaxies from the input catalogue. To evaluate the performance of the method, we used an efficient matching procedure based on the 'blinking' of the simulation's individual redshift lensing planes. Cross-matching the AMICO-WL detections with the dark matter halo sample in the simulation having $M_{200} > 5 \times 10^{13}$ $M_{\odot}/h$ and considering a purity level of $\sim70\%$, the application of the foreground removal doubles the completeness from $6.5\%$ to $13.0\%$ and at the same time produces a significant decrease of spurious detections.","['Leonardo Trobbiani', 'Matteo Maturi', 'Carlo Giocoli', 'Lauro Moscardini', 'Gabriele Panebianco']",15.0,17.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16420,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Gravitational lensing: weak – galaxies: clusters: general – large-scale structure of Universe – methods: data analysis 1'],2025-01-29
Tackling artefacts in the timing of relativistic pulsar binaries: towards the SKA,"Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars in relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits, such as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to explore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations made when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary, the velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies significantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent pulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar rotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this effect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary phase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring the Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase shift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations. We also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude, which are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct dispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the observed bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads to orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital DM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital eccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the timing model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on systems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the measurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be a potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is indispensable.","['Huanchen Hu', 'Nataliya K.

Gravitational wave inference of star cluster properties from intermediate-mass black hole mergers,"Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.","['Konstantinos Kritos', 'Luca Reali', 'Ken K.

Orbital Modeling of HII 1348B: An Eccentric Young Substellar Companion in the Pleiades,"Brown dwarfs with known physical properties (e.g., age and mass) are essential for constraining models of the formation and evolution of substellar objects. We present new high-contrast imaging observations of the circumbinary brown dwarf HII 1348B $\mathord{-}$ one of the few known substellar companions in the Pleiades cluster. We observed the system in the infrared (IR) $L^\prime$ band with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) in dual-aperture direct imaging mode (i.e., with the two telescope apertures used separately) on 2019 September 18. The observations attained a high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR} > 150$) photometric detection and relative astrometry with uncertainties of ${\sim}5 \ \mathrm{mas}$. This work presents the first model of the companion's orbital motion using relative astrometry from five epochs across a total baseline of 23 years.

VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm,"Cosmic voids, the nearly empty regions nestled between walls and filaments, are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. However, a consensus on the definition of voids remains elusive, as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density based on the method that were used. In this paper, we introduce an innovative void identification method that utilizes Genetic Algorithm analysis. VEGA employs the Voronoi tessellation technique and the Convex Hull algorithm to partition the dataset plane into distinct regions and calculate the volume of each region. For the first time, VEGA integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with the luminosity density contrast function to identify and locate the possible void region candidates. This method utilizes a set of grid points, which enhances the implementation of Voronoi tessellation and enables VEGA to more effectively access the dataset space for the identification of void regions candidates, finding the center and the ultimate structure of voids. Finally, we applied the VEGA and Aikio-Mähönen (AM) methods to the same test dataset and compared the cosmic voids identified by VEGA with those identified by the AM method.

A Study of Afterglow Signatures in NaI and CsI Scintillator Modules for the Background and Transient Observer Instrument on COSI,"We present measurements of the afterglow signatures in NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) detector modules as part of the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) mission detector trade-study. BTO is a NASA Student Collaboration Project flying on the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) Small Explorer mission in 2027. The detectors utilized in this study are cylindrical in shape with a height and diameter of 5.1 cm and were read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). We conducted a radiation campaign at the HIMAC accelerator in Japan where the scintillators were irradiated with a 230 MeV/u helium beam (He beam) and 350 MeV/u carbon beam (C beam). We find that both the CsI and NaI scintillators exhibit afterglow signatures when irradiated with the C and He beams. The CsI crystal exhibits a stronger afterglow intensity with afterglow pulses occurring for an average 2.40 ms for C and 0.9 ms for He after the initial particle pulse. The duration of afterglow pulses in CsI is 8.6x and 5.6x the afterglow signal duration in NaI for C and He (0.28 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively). Although CsI has advantages such as a higher light yield and radiation hardness, the stronger afterglows in the CsI detector increase the complexity of the electronics and lead to a ~7x larger dead time per afterglow event or a ~3x higher energy threshold value. We use the measured dead times to predict the amount of observing time lost to afterglow-inducing events for an instrument like BTO in low Earth orbit. We simulate the background rates in a BTO-like orbit and find a total value of 114 counts/s for the full two-detector system. Based on the particle energies in the HIMAC experiment, we then determine that an event with sufficient energy to produce an afterglow signal occurs once every ~70 s and ~1.4 s in NaI and CsI detectors, respectively. Thus, we conclude that NaI is the better choice for the BTO mission.","['Hannah Gulick', 'Hiroki Yoneda', 'Tadayuki Takahashi', 'Claire Chen', 'Kazuhiro Nakazawa', 'Shunsaku Nagasawa', 'Mii Ando', 'Keigo Okuma', 'Alyson Joens', 'Samer Al Nussirat', 'Yasuyuki Shimizu', 'Kaito Fujisawa', 'Takayoshi Kohmura', 'Kouichi Hagino', 'Hisashi Kitamura', 'Andreas Zoglauer', 'Juan Carlos Martinez Oliveros', 'John A.

The Formation of Globular Clusters,"Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and most luminous stellar systems in the Universe, offering unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. While the physical processes behind their origin have long remained elusive, major theoretical and observational developments in the past decade have led to a new understanding of GCs as the natural outcome of high-pressure star formation in high-redshift galaxies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of GC formation and aims to provide a comprehensive point of reference for leveraging the revolutionary capabilities of the current and upcoming generation of telescopes. The latest generation of GC models combine our understanding of their formation and destruction with advanced galaxy formation simulations. The next decade will provide the first-ever opportunity to test such models across their full evolutionary history, from GC formation at high redshift as seen with the James Webb Telescope, to snapshots of GC demographics at intermediate redshifts obtained with 30m-class telescopes, and eventually to the well-characterized GC populations observed at the present day.

Time-Integrated Southern-Sky Neutrino Source Searches with 10 Years of IceCube Starting-Track Events at Energies Down to 1 TeV,"In the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a signal of astrophysical neutrinos is obscured by backgrounds from atmospheric neutrinos and muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions. IceCube event selections used to isolate the astrophysical neutrino signal often focus on t/he morphology of the light patterns recorded by the detector. The analyses presented here use the new IceCube Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection (ESTES), which identifies events likely generated by muon neutrino interactions within the detector geometry, focusing on neutrino energies of 1-500 TeV with a median angular resolution of 1.4°. Selecting for starting track events filters out not only the atmospheric-muon background, but also the atmospheric-neutrino background in the southern sky. This improves IceCube's muon neutrino sensitivity to southern-sky neutrino sources, especially for Galactic sources that are not expected to produce a substantial flux of neutrinos above 100 TeV. In this work, the ESTES sample was applied for the first time to searches for astrophysical sources of neutrinos, including a search for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic plane. No significant excesses were identified from any of the analyses; however, constraining limits are set on the hadronic emission from TeV gamma-ray Galactic plane objects and models of the diffuse Galactic plane neutrino flux.","['R.

The Role of Pressure in the Structure and Stability of GMCs in the Andromeda Galaxy,"We revisit the role of pressure in the structure, stability and confinement of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in light of recently published observations and analysis of the GMCs in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). That analysis showed, that in the absence of any external pressure, most GMCs (57\% by number) in M31 would be gravitationally unbound. Here, after a more detailed examination of the global measurements of surface densities and velocity dispersions, we find that GMCs in M31, when they can be traced to their outermost boundaries, require external pressures for confinement that are consistent with estimates for the mid-plane pressure of this galaxy. We introduce and apply a novel methodology to measure the radial profile of internal pressure within any GMC that is spatially resolved by the CO observations. We show that for the best resolved examples in M31 the internal pressures increase steeply with surface density in a power-law fashion with $p_{int} \sim \Sigma^2$. At high surface densities many of these extragalactic GMCs break from the single power-law and exhibit upward curvature. Both these characteristics of the variation of internal pressure with surface density are in agreement with theoretical expectations for hydrostatic equilibrium at each radial surface of a GMC, including the outermost boundary.","['C.J.

SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E: Observational Evidence of Low Ongoing Star Formation Rates in Gas-Rich Post-Starburst Galaxies,"ALMA observations have shown that candidate ""post-starburst"" galaxies (PSBs) at z$\sim$0.6 can retain significant molecular gas reservoirs. These results would imply that -- unlike many model predictions -- galaxies can shut down their star formation before their cold gas reservoirs are depleted. However, these studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O II] line fluxes or from spectral energy distribution modeling, and could have missed large dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present Keck/NIRES observations of 13 massive ($\mathrm{M_*}\gtrsim \times 10^{11} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) PSBs, which allow us to estimate $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs in these gas-rich post-starburst galaxies. We confirm the previously inferred low SFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected SFRs of $<4.1 \,\mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$. These SFRs are notably low given the large $\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs ($\sim 1-5 \times 10^{10} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them significantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies. The [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios of all 13 PSBs imply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., AGN, shocks, or hot evolved stars) to their $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission, suggesting that even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs, dust-corrected using A$_v$ estimates from SED fitting, confirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies can quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.","['Pengpei Zhu', 'Katherine A.

Differential virial analysis: a new technique to determine the dynamical state of molecular clouds,"Since molecular clouds form stars, at least some parts of them must be in a state of collapse. However, there is a long-standing debate as to whether that collapse is local, involving only a small fraction of the cloud mass, or global, with most mass in a state of collapse up to the moment when it is dispersed by stellar feedback. In principle it is possible to distinguish these possibilities from clouds' virial ratios, which should be a factor of two larger for collapse than for equilibrium, but systematic uncertainties have thus far prevented such measurements. Here we propose a new analysis method to overcome this limitation: while the absolute value of a cloud's virial ratio is too uncertain to distinguish global from local collapse, the differential change in virial ratio as a function of surface density is also diagnostic of clouds' dynamical state, and can be measured with far fewer systematic uncertainties. We demonstrate the basic principles of the method using simple analytic models of supported and collapsing clouds, validate it from full 3D simulations, and discuss possible challenges in applying the method to real data. We then provide a preliminary application of the technique to recent observations of the molecular clouds in Andromeda, showing that most of them are inconsistent with being in a state of global collapse.","['Mark R.

JWST Reveals Varied Origins Between Jupiter's Irregular Satellites,"We report observations of eight Jovian irregular satellites with JWST's NIRSpec instrument: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, Ananke, and Themisto. Irregular satellite families, which are presumed to have formed via collisions, contain various Trojan-like and C-type-asteroid-like surfaces. We sample the three largest members of the Himalia satellite family, detecting the presence of complexed CO$_2$ and a unique absorption band from $\sim2.7-3.6\ \mu m$ whose character correlates with satellite size. The two largest irregular satellites, Himalia family members Himalia and Elara, contain ammoniated phyllosilicates that are not seen in the meteorite inventory. We propose that the Himalia parent body was heterogeneous and formed with materials similar to Ceres-like ammonium-bearing asteroids. Several small ($D\sim 10km$) irregular satellites closely track the colors and absorption bands of ``red'' Jovian Trojans, demonstrating that these compositions are retained amongst the products of collisions that occurred after Jovian capture. We report the first detection of aqueous alteration products in the retrograde satellite swarm, finding Ananke's 3 micron band to closely match phyllosilicates seen in C2 chondrites. Notably, objects with OH absorption features similar to the Trojan asteroid Eurybates are found in both the retrograde Pasiphae family and the prograde Himalia family, confounding a simple link between such materials and a single surface type. The irregular satellites appear consistent with some materials that experienced alteration from liquid water and others that did not. Consequently, Jupiter may have captured bodies that formed from different initial compositions, or bodies that experienced different levels of heating, driving differential alteration processes.","['Benjamin N.

Cosmic Bulk Flow Analysis in Modified Gravity Theories: $f(R)$ and Perturbed $f(R)$ Models with Neutrino Coupling,"In this study, we explore the characteristics of bulk flow across various redshift ranges within the frameworks of $f(R)$ gravity, perturbed $f(R)$ gravity, and perturbed $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos. Our investigation reveals profound insights into large-scale cosmic flows and their interactions with major cosmic structures, such as the Sloan Great Wall (SGW) and the King Ghidorah Supercluster (KGSc). We find that incorporating neutrinos into the perturbed $f(R)$ gravity model results in a substantial increase in bulk flow velocities across all redshifts, with notable enhancements in the higher redshift ranges, where velocities can exceed $3000 \, \mathrm{km/s}$ in the $0.8 < z < 1.4$ range. Moreover, the direction of the bulk flow in this model closely aligns with the dark energy dipole, especially at redshifts $z > 0.4$, showing near-perfect congruence with cosmic superclusters. This suggests a significant interaction between neutrinos and cosmic structures, influencing cosmic acceleration. At lower redshifts, such as $0.1 < z < 0.2$, the bulk flow aligns with the SGW, while in the $0.4 < z < 0.6$ range, it aligns with the KGSc. In the low redshift range $0.001 < z < 0.016$, although velocities are lower, neutrinos still subtly increase the bulk flow velocity and maintain alignment with nearby cosmic structures, like the Local Supercluster. Our results underscore the critical role of neutrinos in shaping cosmic flows and offer new insights into the interplay between dark energy, neutrinos, and modified gravity models.","['Muhammad Yarahmadi', 'Amin Salehi']",11.0,27.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16492,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,Astronomical Journal 2025,['Neutrino —- Bulk Flow — f(R) gravity 1'],2025-01-29
Gaia-ESO Survey: massive stars in the Carina Nebula. II. The spectroscopic analysis of the O-star population,"The new census of massive stars in the Carina nebula reveals the presence of 54 apparently single O-type stars in the Car OB1 association, an extremely active star-forming region which hosts some of the most luminous stars of the Milky Way. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the currently most complete sample of O-type stars in the association can be used to inspect the main physical properties of cluster members and test evolutionary and stellar atmospheres models. We perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis for the most complete sample of apparently single O-type stars in Car OB1 with available spectroscopic data. From the high-resolution GES and OWN spectra we obtain a reliable distribution of rotational velocities for a sample of 37 O-type stars. It shows a bimodal structure with a low velocity peak at 60 km s$^{-1}$ and a short tail of fast rotators reaching 320 km s$^{-1}$. We also perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis and derive effective temperature, surface gravity and He abundance for a sample of 47 O-type stars, now including further stars from GOSSS database. Radii, luminosities, and spectroscopic masses were also determined using $Gaia$ astrometry. We create the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to inspect the evolutionary status of the region and confirm the lack of stars close to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) between $\sim$35 -- 55 M$_\odot$. We confirm a very young population with an age distribution peaking at 1 Myr, some stars close or even on the ZAMS, and a secondary peak at 4 -- 5 Myr in the age distribution. We confirm the youth of Trumpler 14, which is also the only cluster not showing the secondary peak. We also find a clear trend to evolutionary masses higher than derived spectroscopic masses for stars with evolutionary mass below 40 M$_{\odot}$.","['S. R. Berlanas', 'L. Mahy', 'A. Herrero', 'J.

AMPEL workflows for LSST: Modular and reproducible real-time photometric classification,"Modern time-domain astronomical surveys produce high throughput data streams which require tools for processing and analysis. This will be critical for programs making full use of the alert stream from the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO), where spectroscopic labels will only be available for a small subset of all transients. In this context, the AMPEL toolset can work as a code-to-data platform for the development of efficient, reproducible and flexible workflows for real-time astronomical application.We here introduce three different AMPEL channels constructed to highlight different uses of alert streams: to rapidly find infant transients (SNGuess), to provide unbiased transient samples for follow-up (FollowMe) and to deliver final transient classifications (FinalBet). These pipelines already contain placeholders for mechanisms which will be essential for the optimal usage of VRO alerts: combining different classifiers, including host galaxy information, population priors and sampling non-gaussian photometric redshift distributions. Based on the ELAsTiCC simulation, all three channels are already working at a high level: SNGuess correctly tags 99% of all young supernovae, FollowMe illustrates how an unbiased subset of alerts can be selected for spectroscopic follow-up in the context of cosmological probes and FinalBet includes priors to achieve successful classifications for >~80% of all extragalactic transients.The fully functional workflows presented here are all public and can be used as starting points for any group wishing to optimize pipelines for their specific VRO science programs. AMPEL is designed to allow this to be done in accordance with FAIR principles: both software and results can be easily shared and results reproduced. The code-to-data environment ensures that models developed this way can be directly applied to the real-time LSST stream parsed by AMPEL.","['Jakob Nordin', 'Valery Brinnel', 'Jakob van Santen', 'Simeon Reusch', 'Marek Kowalski']",11.0,19.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16511,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],Astronomy & Astrophysics,,['Methods: data analysis'],2025-01-29
Mapping H$\alpha$-Excess Candidate Point Sources in the Southern Hemisphere Using S-PLUS Data,"Context. We use the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Fourth Data Release (DR4) to identify and classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources in the Southern Sky, combining photometric data from 12 S-PLUS filters with machine learning to improve classification of H$\alpha$-related phenomena. Aims. Our goal is to classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources by distinguishing Galactic and extragalactic objects, particularly those with redshifted emission lines, and identifying variability phenomena like RR Lyrae stars. Methods. We selected H$\alpha$-excess candidates using the ($r - J0660$) vs. ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram from the S-PLUS main survey (MS) and Galactic Disk Survey (GDS). UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering were used to separate source types. Infrared data was incorporated, and a Random Forest model was trained on clustering results to identify key colour features. New colour-colour diagrams from S-PLUS MS and infrared data offer a preliminary classification. Results. Combining multiwavelength data with machine learning significantly improved H$\alpha$-excess source classification. We identified 6956 sources with excess in the $J0660$ filter. Cross-matching with SIMBAD explored object types, including emission-line stars, young stellar objects, nebulae, stellar binaries, cataclysmic variables, QSOs, AGNs, and galaxies. Using S-PLUS colours and machine learning, we separated RR Lyrae stars from other sources. The separation of Galactic and extragalactic sources was clearer, but distinguishing cataclysmic variables from QSOs at certain redshifts remained challenging. Infrared data refined the classification, and the Random Forest model highlighted key colour features for future follow-up spectroscopy.","['L. A. Gutiérrez-Soto', 'R. Lopes de Oliveira', 'S.

Star-Forming vs. Quenched Galaxies in Voids: Insights into the Role of Mergers,"Cosmic voids, the largest under-dense structures in the Universe, are crucial for exploring galaxy evolution. These vast, sparsely populated regions are home to void galaxies -- predominantly gas-rich, star-forming, and blue -- that evolve more slowly than those in denser environments. Additionally, the correlation between galaxy mergers and specific properties of galaxies, such as the star formation rate (SFR), is not fully understood, particularly in these under-dense environments. Quenched void galaxies exhibit high SFRs at high redshifts, significantly decreasing at lower redshifts (z < 0.5). These galaxies have higher dark matter halos than star-forming galaxies across all redshifts, leading to rapid gas consumption. They formed earlier and experienced more major mergers in earlier epochs but fewer recent mergers, resulting in a lack of fresh gas for sustained star formation. Also, star-forming and high-mass quenched void galaxies show higher SFRs in mergers compared to non-merger galaxies. This study highlights that formation time, merger rates, and dark matter halos play a crucial role in the star formation history of void galaxies. Rapid and earlier gas consumption due to earlier formation time and the absence of recent mergers could lead to quenched void galaxies at lower redshifts, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution in low-density environments.","['Mohammad Reza Shojaei', 'Saeed Tavasoli', 'Parsa Ghafour']",12.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16545,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: evolution – galaxies: interactions – galaxies: star formation 1'],2025-01-29
Searching for GEMS: Discovery and Characterization of Two Brown Dwarfs Around M Dwarfs,"Brown dwarfs bridge the gap between stars and planets, providing valuable insight into both planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Yet the census of transiting brown dwarf companions, in particular around M dwarf stars, remains incomplete. We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs around low-mass hosts using a combination of space- and ground-based photometry along with near-infrared radial velocities. We characterize TOI-5389Ab ($68.0^{+2.2}_{-2.2} \ \mj$) and TOI-5610b ($40.4^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \ \mj$), two moderately massive brown dwarfs orbiting early M dwarf hosts ($\teff = 3569 \pm 59 \ K$ and $3618 \pm 59 \ K$, respectively). For TOI-5389Ab, the best fitting parameters are period $P=10.40046 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.824^{+0.033}_{-0.031}$~\rj, and low eccentricity $e=0.0962^{+0.0027}_{-0.0046}$. In particular, this constitutes one of the most extreme substellar-stellar companion-to-host mass ratios of $q=0.150$. For TOI-5610b, the best fitting parameters are period $P=7.95346 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.887^{+0.031}_{-0.031}$ \rj, and moderate eccentricity $e=0.354^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$. Both targets are expected to have shallow but potentially observable secondary transits: $\lesssim 500$ ppm in Johnson K band for both. A statistical analysis of M-dwarf/BD systems reveals for the first time that those at short orbital periods ($P < 13$ days) exhibit a dearth of $13 \mj < M_{\rm BD} < 40 \mj$ companions ($q$ $<$ 0.1) compared to those at slightly wider separations.","['Alexander Larsen', 'Tera N.

Euclid preparation. 3-dimensional galaxy clustering in configuration space. Part I. 2-point correlation function estimation,"The 2-point correlation function of the galaxy spatial distribution is a major cosmological observable that enables constraints on the dynamics and geometry of the Universe. The Euclid mission aims at performing an extensive spectroscopic survey of approximately 20--30 million H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies up to about redshift two. This ambitious project seeks to elucidate the nature of dark energy by mapping the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies over a significant portion of the sky. This paper presents the methodology and software developed for estimating the 3-dimensional 2-point correlation function within the Euclid Science Ground Segment. The software is designed to overcome the significant challenges posed by the large and complex Euclid data set, which involves millions of galaxies. Key challenges include efficient pair counting, managing computational resources, and ensuring the accuracy of the correlation function estimation. The software leverages advanced algorithms, including kd-tree, octree, and linked-list data partitioning strategies, to optimise the pair-counting process. The implementation also includes parallel processing capabilities using shared-memory open multi-processing to further enhance performance and reduce computation times. Extensive validation and performance testing of the software are presented. The results indicate that the software is robust and can reliably estimate the 2-point correlation function, which is essential for deriving cosmological parameters with high precision.

The S-PLUS 12-band photometry as a powerful tool for discovery and classification: ten cataclysmic variables in a proof-of-concept study,"Multi-band photometric surveys provide a straightforward way to discover and classify astrophysical objects systematically, enabling the study of a large number of targets at relatively low cost. Here we introduce an alternative approach to select Accreting White Dwarf (AWD) candidates following their spectral energy distribution, entirely supported by the twelve photometric bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). The method was validated with optical spectroscopic follow-up with the Gemini South telescope which unambiguously established ten systems as cataclysmic variables (CVs), alongside Swift X-ray observations of four of them. Among the ten CVs presented here are those that may be low-luminosity intermediate polars or WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with rare outbursts, two subclasses that can be easily missed in time-domain and X-ray surveys, the two methods currently dominating the discovery of new CVs. Our approach based on S-PLUS provides an important, complementary tool to uncover the total population of CVs and the complete set of its subclasses, which is an important step towards a full understanding of close binary evolution, including the origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs and the physics of accretion. Finally, we highlight the potential of S-PLUS beyond AWDs, serving other surveys in the characterization of their sources.","['Raimundo Lopes de Oliveira', 'Amanda S. de Araujo', 'Angela C.

A central TDE candidate detected through spectroscopic continuum emission properties in a SDSS blue quasar,"In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.",['XueGuang Zhang'],7.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16585,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],be published in ApJ,,['galaxies:active - quasars:emission lines - transients: ti dal disruption events - quasars: individual (SDSS J2308) 1'],2025-01-29
Central densities of dark matter halos in FIRE-2 simulations of low-mass galaxies with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter,"We investigate the central density structure of dark matter halos in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models using simulations that are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. For simulated halos of dwarf galaxy scale ($M_{\rm halo}(z=0)\approx 10^{10}\,M_\odot$), we study the central structure in both dissipationless simulations and simulations with full FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics. As has been demonstrated extensively in recent years, both baryonic feedback and self-interactions can convert central cusps into cores, with the former process doing so in a manner that depends sensitively on stellar mass at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Whether the two processes (baryonic feedback and self-interactions) are distinguishable, however, remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that, compared to feedback-induced cores, SIDM-induced cores transition more quickly from the central region of constant density to the falling density at larger radial scales. This result holds true even when including identical galaxy formation modeling in SIDM simulations as is used in CDM simulations, since self-interactions dominate over galaxy formation physics in establishing the central structure of SIDM halos in this mass regime. The change in density profile slope as a function of radius therefore holds the potential to discriminate between self-interactions and galaxy formation physics as the driver of core formation in dwarf galaxies.","['Maria C.

Prediction of Individual Halo Concentrations Across Cosmic Time Using Neural Networks,"The concentration of dark matter haloes is closely linked to their mass accretion history. We utilize the halo mass accretion histories from large cosmological N-body simulations as inputs for our neural networks, which we train to predict the concentration of individual haloes at a given redshift. The trained model performs effectively in other cosmological simulations, achieving the root mean square error between the actual and predicted concentrations that significantly lower than that of the model by Zhao et al. and Giocoli et al. at any redshift. This model serves as a valuable tool for rapidly predicting halo concentrations at specified redshifts in large cosmological simulations.","['Tianchi Zhang', 'Tianxiang Mao', 'Wenxiao Xu', 'Guan Li']",6.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16618,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,"Universe 2025, 11(2), 37.

Three Brown Dwarfs Masquerading as High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST Observations,"We report the spectroscopic identification of three brown dwarf candidates -- o005_s41280, o006_s00089, and o006_s35616 -- discovered in the RUBIES using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) PRISM/CLEAR spectroscopy. We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity, and other derived properties. The results suggest that o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ in the ranges of 2100--2300 K and 1800--2000 K, are likely L dwarfs, while o006_s00089, with $T_\mathrm{eff} < 1000$ K, is consistent with a late T dwarf classification. The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the $Y$, $J$, and $H$ bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color-color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006_s00089, overlap with little red dots (LRDs), while hotter L dwarfs, like o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, tend to contaminate the high-redshift galaxy cluster. These findings suggest a brown dwarf contamination rate of approximately 0.1% in extragalactic deep field surveys, with L dwarfs being more frequently detected than cooler T and Y dwarfs.","['Zhijun Tu', 'Shu Wang', 'Xiaodian Chen', 'Jifeng Liu']",8.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16648,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['L dwarfs (894)', 'Brown dwarfs (185)', 'T dwarfs (1679)', 'High- redshift galaxies (734) 1', 'Stellar atmospheres (1584)']",2025-01-29
ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of massive Star-forming regions -XX. Probability distribution function of integrated intensity for dense molecular gas tracers,"We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N (J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the ATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions) Survey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function for these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the power-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the correlation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of the molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling relationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear, indicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the dense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship between Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally bound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star formation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak anti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star formation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the corresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps with substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation efficiencies.","['C.Zhang', 'Tie Liu', 'Sihan Jiao', 'Feng-Yao Zhu', 'Z.-Y. Ren', 'H.-L.

Flaring Activities of Fast Rotating Stars have Solar-like Latitudinal Distribution,"The dynamo theory has always been one of the biggest mysteries in stellar physics. One key reason for its uncertainty is poor knowledge of the dynamo process on stars except the Sun. The most important observation feature of solar dynamo is that active regions only appear at low latitudes, which provides a crucial constraint to the dynamo theory, while Doppler imaging, the current technique to spatially resolve stellar hemisphere, is difficult to distinguish the equatorial region . Hence, the latitudinal distribution of active regions (LDAR) of stars is ambiguous and controversial, mainly due to the limit of the current technique for spatially resolving the stellar surface. Fast rotating stars, which are young and active, are thought to operate with a different dynamo process than the Sun. We study their LDAR and compare them with the Sun to reveal the underlying dynamo process. Flares are drastic and observational activity events, which occur in active regions. Here, we propose a new method to study how the apparent flaring activity varies with respect to the inclination to determine the LDAR of fast rotatingthis http URLfind that the LDAR of fast rotating stars is consistent with that of the Sun, contrary to expectations. Our results provide a crucial constraint to stellar dynamo, indicating that the solar-like dynamo also applies to fast rotating stars, even spanning different stages of their evolution.","['Huiqin Yang', 'Xin Cheng', 'Jifeng Liu', 'Shuai Liu', 'Zhanhao Zhao', 'Guiping Zhou', 'Yijun Hou', 'Changliang Gao', 'Zexi Niu']",10.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16694,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Stars:activity – Stars:flare – Sun:activity – Sun:flare 1'],2025-01-29
BASS XLV: Quantifying AGN Selection Effects in the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy Survey with BASS,"Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field (CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high column densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To quantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\sim0.05$) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\gtrsim$1000 cts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption distribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar luminosities to the CCLS ($L_\mathrm{2-10\ keV}^\mathrm{int}\sim10^{42-45}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration and low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the spectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to detect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\mathrm{H}>10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and luminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient counts ($\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is significantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best fit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\mathrm{H}\geq10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually unobscured sources ($N_\mathrm{H}<10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies that previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the obscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our findings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases and forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for higher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate obscuration in distant supermassive black holes.","['Yarone M.

A Neural Network Model for the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the CAMELS Simulations,"The probability distribution, $p(\mathrm{DM})$ of cosmic dispersion measures (DM) measured in fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes information about both cosmology and galaxy feedback. In this work, we study the effect of feedback parameters in the $p(\mathrm{DM})$ calculated from the full Latin Hypercube of parameters sampled by the CAMELS hydrodynamical simulation suite, building a neural network (NN) model that performs well in emulating the effect of feedback on $p(\mathrm{DM})$ at arbitrary redshifts at $z\leq1$. Using this NN model, we further study the parameter $F\equiv \sigma_{\rm DM} \, z^{1/2}$, which is commonly used to summarize the scatter on $p(\mathrm{DM})$. We find that $F$ does not depend monotonically on every feedback parameter; instead each feedback mechanism jointly influences the final feedback strength in non-trivial ways. Even the largest values of $F$ that we find in our entire parameter space are small compared to the current constraints from observed FRB DMs by Baptista et al. 2024, pointing at the limitations of the CAMELS suite due to the small simulation box sizes. In the future, with larger box-sizes from CAMELS-like suites, similar models can be used to constrain the parameters governing galaxy feedback in the increasing observational samples of FRBs.","['Qi Guo', 'Khee-Gan Lee']",4.0,9.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16709,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['galaxies: intergalactic medium - transients: fast radio bursts - methods: numerical - software: machine learning'],2025-01-29
NuSTAR detection of a hot stellar superflare with a temperature of 95 MK in hard X-rays,"A search of the hard X-ray archive data of NuSTAR found a transient source, NuSTAR J230059+5857.4, during an observation of 1E 2259+586 on 2013 April 25. A multi-wavelength analysis using X-ray, optical, and IR data, mostly taken in its quiescent phase, was conducted to identify the origin of NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 and elucidate the phenomena associated with the flare activity. The results indicated that NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 was a stellar flare that occurred on a single M-dwarf, M-dwarf binary, or pre-main-sequence star. NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 exhibited the higher emission measure and higher temperature, 8.60+2.15/-1.73x10^54 cm^-3 and 8.21+2.71/-1.86 keV, respectively, on average than the nominal values of stellar flares reported in the past. The flare loop size estimated on the basis of the model to balance the plasma and magnetic pressures was larger than the stellar radius by a factor of several. Since based on solar flare loops, this flare loop scale is excessively large, we conjecture that the observed large emission measure is possible to be attributed to the observation of mutually-associated multiple flares simultaneously occurring on the stellar surface, known as sympathetic flares. Thanks to the large effective area of NuSTAR in the hard X-ray band, we can conduct detailed discussion about a temperature variation associated with the flare. Investigation of the temperature variation during the flare revealed that the temperature remained significantly higher than during the quiescent phase even after the count rate dropped to around 5% of the peak. The sustained high temperature over the long duration is consistent with the idea of sympathetic flares. We found that it is essential to use theoretical models to evaluate loops and assess temporal changes in temperature as done in this study to determine whether there are multiple flares or not when analyzing flare observation data.","['Tomohiro Hakamata', 'Hironori Matsumoto', 'Hirokazu Odaka', 'Shinsuke Takasao']",13.0,12.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16710,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,G X-rays: stars — infrared: stars — stars: ﬂare — stars: late-t ype — stars: activity ,2025-01-29
Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1,"We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.","['Lingfeng Wei', 'Jessica R. Lu', 'Peter C. Boyle', 'Matthew W. Hosek Jr.', 'Quinn M. Konopacky', 'Richard G.

Constraining the Milky Way's Dispersion Measure Using FRB and X-ray Data,"The dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a valuable tool for probing the baryonic content of the intergalactic and the circumgalactic medium of the intervening galaxies along the sightlines. However, interpreting the DMs is complicated by the contributions from the hot gas in and around our Milky Way. This study examines the relationship between DM_MW, derived from localized FRBs, and the Galaxy's hot gas, using X-ray absorption and emission data from O VII and O VIII. We find evidence for a positive correlation between DM_MW and O VII absorption, reflecting contributions from both the disk and halo components. This conclusion is supported by two lines of evidence: (1) No correlation between DM_MW and O VII/O VIII emission, which primarily traces dense disk regions; and (2) the comparison with electron density models, where DM_MW aligns with models that incorporate both disk and halo components but significantly exceeds predictions from pure disk-only models, emphasizing the halo's role. Furthermore, the lack of correlation with O VIII absorption suggests that the primary temperature of the Galaxy's hot gas is likely around 2 x 10^6 K or less, as traced by O VII absorption, while gas at higher temperatures (~3 x 10^6 K to 5 x 10^6 K) is present but less abundant. Our findings provide insights into the Milky Way's gas distribution and improve DM_MW estimates for future cosmological studies.","['Jiale Wang', 'Zheng Zhou', 'Xiaochuan Jiang', 'Taotao Fang']",4.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16770,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Galaxy: halo'],2025-01-29
Assessing the validity of the anelastic and Boussinesq approximations to model solar inertial modes,"Global-scale inertial modes of oscillations have been recently observed on the Sun. They might play an important dynamic and diagnostic role for the Sun. This work aims to assess the validity of simplifying assumptions in the equation of continuity, which have often been used in the linear models of solar inertial modes. We compute the linear eigenmodes of the Sun's convection zone in the inertial frequency range using the Dedalus code. This single framework enables us to compare the sensitivity of the modes to different model setups, such as the compressible setup and the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations. We consider both the cases of uniform rotation and solar differential rotation (as given by helioseismology). We find that the compressible and anelastic models have almost identical eigenmodes under uniform rotation and solar differential rotation. On the other hand, the absence of density stratification in the Boussinesq model results in significantly different eigenmodes under these setups. The differences are most prominent for the non-toroidal modes with significant radial motions mainly due to the absence of the compressional $\beta$-effect. The anelastic approximation simplifies the calculations and reduces the numerical cost without affecting the solar inertial modes. The Boussinesq or incompressible approximations cannot be used to model the solar inertial modes accurately. Since the effects of differential rotation on the eigenmodes are very significant, an acceptable setup is to use the anelastic approximation together with the solar differential rotation.","['Suprabha Mukhopadhyay', 'Yuto Bekki', 'Xiaojue Zhu', 'Laurent Gizon']",8.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16797,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,['Sun: oscillations - Sun: interior - Sun: rotation - Hydrodynamics - Instabilities 1'],2025-01-29
"On variability of DDO68-V1, a unique extremely metal-poor LBV","DDO68-V1 is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star in the eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) galaxy DDO68. It resides in the HII region with 12+log(O/H)~7.1 dex, or Z ~ Zo/40. Since DDO68-V1 is the only known LBV with a so low initial metallicity, its in-deep study can give the hints for understanding the LBV evolutionary stage and the nature of their powerful and highly variable mass loss in the very low-metallicity regime. Our goal is to study the optical variability of DDO68-V1 during the last 36 years, with the emphasis on the period of the last 8 years, after the LBV giant eruption. We use our published results of monitoring in B, V, R bands of the total flux of HII region 'Knot 3', containing the LBV, along with photometry of the archive Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, obtained in May 2010 and December 2017. This data allow us to disentangle the variable light of DDO68-V1 and that of the underlying HII region. From all available photometry of Knot 3, we derive the V-band lightcurve of DDO68-V1 since 1988, with a higher cadence during the years 2015-2023, when the lightcurve resembles that of S Doradus. The new data reveal the full range of DDO68-V1 absolute magnitudes M_V of [-5.9, --10.8] mag. The LBV variations after the fading of the 'giant eruption' show the unusually large amplitude of delta_V > 3.0-3.5mag on the time-scale of ~1-1.5 year. The apparent changes of the integrated B-V colour of Knot 3 are consistent with the expected colour variations of the LBV in course of the S Doradus 'normal eruptions'. These data, along with spectra of DDO68-V1, demonstrate the need for a higher-cadence photometry of DDO68-V1, in order to probe the possible periodicity in its lightcurve and binarity of the object.","['S.A.

Evaluation of new radio occultation observations among small satellites at Venus by data assimilation,"We conducted observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for radio occultation measurements (RO) among small satellites, which are expected to be useful for future Venus missions. The effectiveness of the observations based on realistic orbit calculations was evaluated by reproduction of the ""cold collar"", a unique thermal structure in the polar atmosphere of Venus. Pseudo-temperature observations for the OSSEs were provided from the Venus atmospheric GCM in which the cold collar was reproduced by the thermal forcing. The vertical temperature distributions between 40 and 90 km altitudes at observation points were assimilated. The result showed that the cold collar was most clearly reproduced in the case where the temperature field in high-latitudes was observed twice a day, suggesting that the proposed observation is quite effective to improve the polar atmospheric structure at least.

Multi-Messenger and Cosmological Constraints on Dark Matter through Two-Fluid Neutron Star Modeling,"In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. Employing NM equations of state spanning a wide range of stiffness and a self-interacting asymmetric fermionic DM framework, we explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. Constraints from gravitational waves (GW170817), NICER X-ray measurements (PSR J0030+0451), and pulsar mass limits (PSR J0740+6620) delineate a consistent parameter space for DM properties derived from these multi-messenger observations. DM halo-dominated configurations, while consistent with PSR J0740+6620's mass limits and NICER's radius measurements for PSR J0030+0451, are ruled out by the tidal deformability bounds inferred from the GW170817 event. Consequently, the combined limits inferred from the observational data of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620 support the plausibility of DM core-dominated configurations. Constraints on the DM self-interaction strength from galaxy cluster dynamics further refine the DM parameter space permitted by NS observations. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.","['Ankit Kumar', 'Sudhakantha Girmohanta', 'Hajime Sotani']",13.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16829,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-29
Generalized framework for likelihood-based field-level inference of growth rate from velocity and density fields,"Measuring the growth rate of large-scale structures ($f$) as a function of redshift has the potential to break degeneracies between modified gravity and dark energy models, when combined with expansion-rate probes. Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have gained interest to estimate $f\sigma_8$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with an unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for non-linear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We develop a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of $f\sigma_8$. We derive a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also include the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compare their performance against ours, we validate our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we perform allow us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage used in our calculations than previous works, which is particularly interesting for non-linear model extensions. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the $f\sigma_8$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 % closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.","['Corentin Ravoux', 'Bastien Carreres', 'Damiano Rosselli', 'Julian Bautista', 'Anthony Carr', 'Tyann Dummerchat', 'Alex G.

Star formation from low to high mass: A comparative view,"Star formation has often been studied by separating the low- and high-mass regimes with an approximate boundary at 8M_sun. While some of the outcomes of the star-formation process are different between the two regimes, it is less clear whether the physical processes leading to these outcomes are that different at all. Here, we systematically compare low- and high-mass star formation by reviewing the most important processes and quantities from an observational and theoretical point of view. We identify three regimes where processes are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between low- and high-mass star formation.Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties and density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational characteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment.Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates as well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity significantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the magnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained.Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate mainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in regions forming high-mass stars. Nevertheless, accretion apparently can continue via disk structures in ionized accretion flows.Finally, we discuss to what extent a unified picture of star formation over all masses is possible and which issues need to be addressed in the future.","['H.

Wavelength-dependent far-infrared polarization of HL Tau observed with SOFIA/HAWC+,"We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114° at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.","['Moritz Lietzow-Sinjen', 'Sebastian Wolf', 'Robert Brunngräber']",6.0,11.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16873,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Astrophysics of Galaxies']",,,['magnetic fields – polarization – protoplanetary disks – stars: individual (HL Tau) – techniques: polarimetric 1'],2025-01-29
Time Evolution of Mg II in SDSS J2320+0024: Implications for a Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Hole System,"Here we present results from our spectroscopic follow-up of SDSS J2320+0024, a candidate binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a suspected sub-pc separation, identified by a 278-day periodicity observed in its multi-band optical light curves. We investigate the dramatic variability of the complex Mg II emission line profile aiming to test the alignments of the observed photometric light curves and the spectroscopic signatures in the context of the binary SMBH system. We extract the pure broad Mg II line from the newly obtained Gemini and Magellan spectra and measure the emission line parameters to reveal fundamental dynamical parameters of the SMBHs binary system. We adopt the PoSKI sub-pc binary SMBH model, which includes broad-line region (BLR) around less massive component and a circumbinary BLR, to interpret the observed variability in the spectral profile. We find that the Mg II line profile has a distinctive complex shape with the asymmetry and two peaks present which is varying across recent and archival observations. The temporal variability of the Mg II line profile may be associated with the emission from the binary SMBH system consisting of components with masses $M_1 = 2 \times 10^7 \, M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 2 \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, and eccentricity e = 0.1. With an total estimated mass of $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a subannual orbital period, this system may be a rare example of high-mass compact candidate of SMBH binary, thus important for further investigations of the evolution of the binary system.

A failed wind candidate in NGC 3783 from the 2001 year campaign with Chandra/HETGS,"We reanalyze the Chandra/HETGS observations of NGC 3783 from the campaign in the year 2001, identifying significant spectral variations in the Fe unresolved transition array (UTA) over timescales of weeks to months. These changes correlate with a $1.4-2$ fold increase in the ionizing continuum and exceed $10 \, \sigma$ significance. The variations primarily originate from a low-ionization state ($\rm log \xi = 1.65$) component of the warm absorber. Time-dependent photoionization modelling confirms the sensitivity of this low-ionization component to continuum variations within the Fe UTA band. Local fitting indicates a lower density limit of $>10^{12.3} \, \rm m^{-3}$ at $3 \, \sigma$ statistical uncertainty, with the component located within $0.27 \, \rm pc$. Our findings suggest that this low-ionization component is a potential failed wind candidate.","['Chen Li', 'Jelle S.

Influence of the Galactic Halo on the UHECR Multipoles,"We examine the effects of a giant magnetized halo around the Galaxy on the angular distribution of the arriving ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed at Earth. We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and track them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in the Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is increased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment increases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the quadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the origin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of the UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude as well.","['Vasundhara Shaw', 'Arjen Van Vliet', 'Andrew M.

Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?,"The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty ruling out early new physics.","['Jun-Qian Jiang', 'Yun-Song Piao']",9.0,34.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16883,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-29
Impact of light sterile neutrinos on cosmological large scale structure,"Sterile neutrinos with masses on the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale are promising candidates to account for the origin of neutrino mass and the reactor neutrino anomalies. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos in the early universe could result in a large abundance of relic sterile neutrinos, which depends on not only their physical mass $m_{\rm eff}$ but also their degree of thermalization, characterized by the extra effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm off}$. Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the effects of sterile neutrinos on the matter power spectrum, halo pairwise velocity, and halo mass and velocity functions. We find that the presence of sterile neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum and halo mass and velocity functions, but enhance the halo pairwise velocity. We also provide fitting formulae to quantify these effects.","['Rui Hu', 'Ming-chung Chu', 'Shek Yeung', 'Wangzheng Zhang']",11.0,22.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16908,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,"['power spectrumarXiv:2501', 'neutrino properties', 'cosmological neutrinos', 'cosmological simulations']",2025-01-29
Uncertainties in astrophysical gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from proton-proton cross-sections in the GeV to PeV range,"The identification of Cosmic Ray (CR) sources represents one of the biggest and long-standing questions in astrophysics. Direct measurements of cosmic rays cannot provide directional information due to their deflection in (extra)galactic magnetic fields. Cosmic-ray interactions at the sources lead to the production of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, which, combined in the multimessenger picture, are the key to identifying the origins of CRs and estimating transport properties. While gamma-ray observations alone raise the question of whether their origin is hadronic or leptonic, the observation of high-energy neutrino emission directly points to the presence of CR hadrons. To identify the emission signatures from acceleration and transport effects a proper modeling of those interactions in a transport framework is needed. Significant work has been done to tune the production cross sections to accelerator data and different models exist that put the exact evolution of the Monte-Carlo generated showers into a statistical approach of a probabilistic description of the production of the final states of the showers relevant for astrophysical observations.In this work, we present the implementation of different hadronic interaction (HI) models into the publicly available transport code CRPropa. We apply different descriptions of the HI, trained on observational data in different energy regimes to a nearby, giant molecular cloud. In this case, the resulting gamma-ray flux can differ by a factor $\sim 2$ dependent on the choice of the HI model.","['Julien Dörner', 'Leonel Morejon', 'Karl-Heinz Kampert', 'Jula Becker Tjus']",10.0,23.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16967,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-29
The case for large-scale AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations: insights from XFABLE,"While cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached maturity, able to reproduce many fundamental galaxy and halo properties, no consensus has yet been reached on the impact of `baryonic feedback' on the non-linear matter power spectrum. This severely limits the precision of (and potentially biases) small-scale cosmological constraints obtained from weak lensing and galaxy surveys. Recent observational evidence indicates that `baryonic feedback' may be more extreme than commonly assumed in current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we therefore explore a range of empirical AGN feedback models, within the FABLE simulation suite, with different parameterizations as a function of cosmic time, host halo properties, and/or spatial location where feedback energy is thermalized. We demonstrate that an AGN radio-mode feedback acting in a larger population of black holes, with jets thermalizing at relatively large cluster-centric distances, as exemplified by our XFABLE model, is in good agreement with the latest weak lensing + kSZ constraints across all k-scales. Furthermore, XFABLE maintains good agreement with the galaxy stellar mass function, gas fraction measurements, and all key galaxy group and cluster properties, including scaling relations and ICM radial profiles. Our work highlights the pressing need to model black hole accretion and feedback physics with a greater level of realism, including relativistic, magnetized jets in full cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss how a range of complementary observational probes in the near future will enable us to constrain AGN feedback models, and therefore reduce `baryonic feedback' modelling uncertainty for the upcoming era of large cosmological surveys.","['Leah Bigwood', 'Martin A.

Optical investigation of supernova remnant G206.7+5.9,"The shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) G206.7+5.9 was recently discovered in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The remnant spans about 3.5 in diameter and exhibits bilateral shells. In this work, we present optical spectra of G206.7+5.9 with the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and narrow-band (H$\alpha$ and [SII]) images with the 1-m T100 telescope. The filamentary structure seen in H$\alpha$ image shows a clear correlation with the radio emission. We use optical line ratios to determine the physical parameters of G206.7+5.9. The LAMOST spectra reveal large ratios of [SII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.61-1.78) and [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.63-1.92) consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The emission lines [OI] $\lambda$6300, $\lambda$6363 detected in the spectra also support the presence of shocks. Electron density ($n_{\rm e}$) measurements based on the [SII] $\lambda$6716/$\lambda$6731 ratio suggest densities between 117 and 597 cm$^{-3}$. We estimate the pre-shock cloud density ($n_{\rm c}$) to be approximately 2.6$-$13.3 cm$^{-3}$. We also investigate the archival HI data and have newly identified an expanding gas motion of the HI, whose velocity span is approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$.

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND),"This chapter presents Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the proposal that, below a certain acceleration scale $a_0$, dynamics departs from the Newtonian expectation. In that context, the determining factor for the emergence of apparent missing matter in galactic systems is predicted to be the acceleration, and not the mass or size of the system. MOND enables, for example, the prediction of rotation curves from only the baryonic distribution of galaxies. The simple rule is that the acceleration observed in the low-acceleration regime is the square root of the Newtonian expectation times $a_0$. Immediately, the flatness of rotation curves follows, as well as the proportionality of the fourth power of the asymptotic circular speed to only the baryonic mass of the galaxy. While the asymptotic circular speed is predicted not to depend on the baryonic surface density of galaxies of fixed baryonic mass, the inner shape of rotation curves is predicted to strongly depend on it. More generally, MOND implies an algebraic relation between the acceleration expected from Newtonian gravity and the total observed acceleration, at any radius in a galaxy. This is known, observationally, as the Radial Acceleration Relation. For galaxy clusters, it is commonly accepted that MOND fails, needing a stronger gravitational force (or more baryonic mass than observed) to account for the thermodynamic state of galaxy clusters, their lensing and kinematics. MOND, however, is not a complete theory, but a phenomenological non-relativistic paradigm in the limit of low accelerations, in need of embedding in a more fundamental theory. While various non-relativistic field theories of MOND exist, the search for a relativistic theory that recovers general relativity for high accelerations and MOND for low accelerations in the quasi-static limit, as well as a cosmology compatible with observations, is still on-going.","['Benoit Famaey', 'Amel Durakovic']",5.0,20.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17006,Astrophysics of Galaxies,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,[],2025-01-29
"The interplay between super-metallicity, lithium depletion, and radial migration in nearby stars","We report the discovery of a peculiar set of old super-metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between $\sim$ 0.5-1.5 kpc observed by the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. These stars show lithium (Li) depletion, which is anti-correlated with their [Fe/H]. To investigate these stars' chemo-dynamical properties, we used data from the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. We applied hierarchical clustering to group the stars based on their abundances (excluding Li). Orbits were integrated using \emph{Gaia} astrometry and radial velocities from \emph{Gaia}-ESO. Our analysis suggests that the high metallicity of these stars is incompatible with their formation in the solar neighbourhood. We also found that their Li envelope abundance is below the benchmark meteoritic value, in agreement with previous works. This result supports the idea that the Li abundance in old, super-metal-rich dwarf stars should not be considered a proxy for the local interstellar medium Li.","['M. L. L. Dantas', 'R.

EZOA: Nan\c{c}ay HI follow-up observations in the Zone of Avoidance,"We present follow-up 21cm HI line observations made with the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT) of 99 weak or potential detections of galaxies from the EZOA catalogue in the northern Zone of Avoidance (ZoA), which were extracted from the shallow version of the EBHIS blind HI survey performed with the Effelsberg radio telescope. The new NRT observations are on average almost three times as sensitive as those from EBHIS. Of the 99 observed sources, we confirmed 72, while three yielded inconclusive results. We find that the quality assessment of the EZOA catalogue entries correlates well with the NRT recovery rate; for instance, only four of the 22 potential detections could be confirmed. Due to the higher sensitivity as well as the large north-south extent of the NRT beam, the NRT observations also yielded five serendipitous detections, which we include here.

Benchmarking Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Classification in Simulated Gamma-Ray Burst Detection,"This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations.

Detection of extended X-ray emission surrounding PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA,"Extended very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from middle-aged pulsars as revealed recently by several groundbased $\gamma$-ray experiments has strong implication on the transport of high-energy particles in the interstellar medium surrounding those pulsars. The $\gamma$-ray emission is widely believed to be produced by high-energy electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebulae when scattering off the interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton process. Multiwavelength counterparts of the $\gamma$-ray halos are expected to be present, which are, however, not observed yet. In this work, we report for the first time the detection of extended X-ray emission from $\sim 0.2^{\circ}$ radius region of PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.7$. The fluxes decrease with radius faster than the prediction of the particle diffusion and synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic field, suggesting the existence of a radial gradient of the magnetic field strength as $\sim r^{-1}$.

Viscous circumbinary protoplanetary discs -- II. Disc effects on the binary orbit,"More than half of all stars are part of binaries, and many form in a common circumbinary disc. The interaction with the binary shapes the disc to feature a large eccentric inner cavity and spirals in the inner disc. The shape of the cavities is linked to binary and disc properties like viscosity and scale height, and the disc and cavity shape influences the orbital evolution of the binary stars.This is the second part of the study in which we use 2D hydrodynamic long-term simulations for a range of viscous parameters relevant to protoplanetary discs to understand the interaction between young stars and the circumbinary disc. The long-term simulations allow us to study how disc shape and exchange of mass, momentum and energy between binary and disc depend on the precession angle between disc and binary orbit on time scales of thousands of binary orbits.We find a considerable, periodic interaction between the precession of the disc and the binary eccentricity that can significantly exceed the precession-averaged change in eccentricity. We further confirm that thin discs ($H/R<0.05$) lead to shrinking binary orbits, also in the regime of low viscosity, $\alpha=10^{-3}$. In general, the disc can excite eccentricity in binaries with initial eccentricities in the range of $e_\mathrm{bin}=0.05-0.4$. In most cases, the terms aiding shrinking or expansion and circularisation or excitation are nearly balanced, and the evolution of the binary semi-major axis and eccentricity will be sensitive to the ratio of mass accretion between the secondary and primary components.","['Anna B.T.

The CLASS Quasar Catalog: Coronal Line Activity in Type 1 SDSS Quasars,"We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z < 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines ($>100$eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] $\lambda$3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.","['Sara Doan', 'Shobita Satyapal', 'Michael Reefe', 'Remington O.

Investigating the role of bars in quenching star formation using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps,"Bars are ubiquitously found in disc galaxies and are known to drive galaxy evolution through secular processes. However, the specific contribution of bars in suppression of star formation (SF) is still under inspection which we investigate in this paper using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps & radial color profiles of a sample of 17 centrally quenched (CQ) barred galaxies in redshift range 0.02-0.06. The sample is selected based on their location in M$_{\ast}$ - SFR plane. They are classified as passive based on parameters from MPA-JHU VAC, but non-passive based on the GSWLC catalog, indicating a passive inner region & recent star formation in their extended disc. We use archival SDSS r-band and GALEX FUV & NUV imaging data and created spatially resolved (FUV-NUV vs NUV-r) colour maps to understand the nature of UV emission from different regions of these galaxies. We then analyse their NUV-r radial profiles using NUV-r colour as a proxy for stellar population (SP) age. A control sample of 8 CQ unbarred galaxies is also analysed to disentangle the effect of bulge and bar in quenching SF. The CQ barred galaxies display redder colors (NUV-r $>$ 4-4.5 mag) in inner regions, up to the length of the bar, indicating the age of stellar population in these regions to be older than $>$ 1 Gyr. Most barred galaxies in our sample host pseudo bulges and do not host AGN, emphasizing most probable reason for the internal quenching is action of stellar bar. In comparison to the unbarred, the barred galaxies show redder colors to a larger spatial extent. We conclude that bars in their later stages of evolution turn the inner regions of galaxies redder, leading to quenching, with the effect being most prominent up to the ends of the bar and creating a region dominated by older SP. This may occur when bars have already funneled gas to the galactic centre leaving behind no fuel for further SF.","['D.

Observations of the First Galaxies in the Era of JWST,"We provide a review of our current knowledge of galaxies throughout the first billion years of cosmic history. This field has undergone a transformation in the last two years following the launch of $\textit{JWST}$, and we aim to deliver an observational overview of what we have learned about $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We introduce the latest selection methods of high redshift galaxies and describe new measurements of the census of continuum-selected and dusty star forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim 5$. We discuss new measurements of the UV luminosity function at $z\gtrsim 10$ and associated implications for early star formation. We then summarize what is being learned about the physical properties of early galaxies, with up-to-date discussions of the sizes, masses, ages, metallicities, abundance patterns, UV colors, dust properties, and ionizing sources in $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We review observational evidence for bursty star formation histories and describe prospects for characterizing the duty cycle with future observations. We provide a brief overview of the insight being gained through new detections of AGN in early galaxies. Finally we introduce the latest constraints on the contribution of galaxies to reionziation and discuss how $\textit{JWST}$ measurements of Ly$\alpha$ emission offer the potential to probe the earliest stages of the process.

Revisiting the multi-planetary system of the nearby star HD 20794: Confirmation of a low-mass planet in the habitable zone of a nearby G-dwarf,"Close-by Earth analogs and super-Earths are of primary importance because they will be preferential targets for the next generation of direct imaging instruments. Bright and close-by G-to-M type stars are preferential targets in radial velocity surveys to find Earth analogs. We present an analysis of the RV data of the star HD 20794, a target whose planetary system has been extensively debated in the literature. The broad time span of the observations makes it possible to find planets with signal semi-amplitudes below 1 m/s in the habitable zone. We monitored the system with ESPRESSO. We joined ESPRESSO data with the HARPS data, including archival data and new measurements from a recent program. We applied the post-processing pipeline YARARA to HARPS data to correct systematics, improve the quality of RV measurements, and mitigate the impact of stellar activity. Results. We confirm the presence of three planets, with periods of 18.3142 +/- 0.0022 d, 89.68 +/- 0.10 d, and 647.6 +/- 2.6 d, along with masses of 2.15 +/- 0.17 MEarth, 2.98 +/- 0.29 MEarth, and 5.82 +/- 0.57 MEarth respectively. For the outer planet, we find an eccentricity of 0.45 +/- 0.10, whereas the inner planets are compatible with circular orbits. The latter is likely to be a rocky planet in the habitable zone of HD 20794. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period around 3000 d, along with evidence pointing to a rotation period around 39 d. We have determined the presence of a system of three planets orbiting the solar-type star HD 20794. This star is bright (V=4.34 mag) and close (d = 6.04 pc), and HD 20794 d resides in the stellar habitable zone, making this system a high-priority target for future atmospheric characterization with direct imaging facilities.","['N.

Reassessing the origin and evolution of Ecliptic Comets in the Planet-9 Scenario,"A group of newly observed extreme trans-Neptunian objects exhibit unexpected orbital confinement, characterized by the alignment of orbital angular momentum vectors and apsidal lines. It is proposed that an undiscovered giant planet, named Planet-9, exists in the solar system's outer regions and causes this clustering. Initial studies suggested Planet-9 could have a mass of 15 Earth masses. However, such a massive planet strongly interacts with scattered disk objects (SDOs; 50 < a < 1000 au) and influences the orbits of short-period comets, resulting in orbital inclinations inconsistent with observations. This study models the formation and long-term evolution of trans-Neptunian object populations and the Oort cloud during the solar system's dynamical instability, using revised parameters for Planet-9. Simulations assume Planet-9 has a mass of 7.5 Earth masses, an inclination of ~20 degrees, a semi-major axis of ~600 au, and an eccentricity of ~0.3. Results suggest a less massive Planet-9 aligns with observed trans-Neptunian object inclinations and the number of ecliptic comets (D > 10 km). Distant Kuiper belt objects with 40 < q < 100 au and 200 < a < 500 au, particularly with significant inclinations, are more likely to align apsidally with Planet-9, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 0.5-0.7. Lower inclination objects (<20 degrees) exhibit significant apsidal anti-alignment, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 2-4. These findings offer a new observational direction to refine the search for Planet-9.","['Rafael Ribeiro', 'Andre Izidoro', 'Alessandro Morbidelli', 'David Nesvorny', 'Othon Cabo Winter']",8.0,22.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17129,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['comets'],2025-01-29
Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR Observations of the Neutron Star Low-mass X-ray Binary Serpens X-1,"We present the first contemporaneous NICER and NuSTAR analysis of the low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 obtained in June 2023, performing broadband X-ray spectral analysis modeling of the reprocessed emission with RELXILLNS from $0.4-30$ keV. We test various continuum and background estimation models to ensure that our results do not hinge on the choice of model used and found that the detection of reflection features is independent of the choice of both continuum and background model. The position of the inner accretion disk is consistent with the last stable circular orbit ($R_{\rm in} \leq 1.2$~$R_{ISCO}$) and a low inclination of $i\leq 8.3 ^{\circ}$. Additionally, we investigate the presence of the low energy ($\sim$ 1 keV) Fe L complex in the data from NICER and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on XMM-Newton that was previously reported in the literature. We find that the line is at most a 2% feature relative to the reprocessed continuum and are unable to claim a definitive detection for the current dataset. However, we discuss plausible conditions and systems that would increase the likelihood of detecting this feature in the future.","['H. Hall', 'R. M. Ludlam', 'J. M. Miller', 'A. C. Fabian', 'J. A.

A new approximation for heavy-lepton neutrino pair processes in simulations of core-collapse supernovae,"In this paper, we present a new approximation for efficiently and effectively including heavy-lepton neutrino pair-production processes in neutrino transport simulations of core-collapse supernovae. In the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism, the electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the main players in transporting the energy of the cooling PNS to the matter behind the shock. While heavy-lepton neutrinos, $\nu_x$, play a smaller role in the heating of the gain region, they dominate the cooling of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and therefore still play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. In this study, we explore the impacts of modifications in the transport and formalisms of pair ($\nu_x\bar{\nu}_x$) emission and absorption processes. We quantify the impact in terms of the emergent neutrino signal and the nature of the PNS convection and early cooling. For this, we perform a set of simulations, spherically symmetric and axisymmetric, of a 20 M$_\odot$ progenitor using two different state-of-the-art equations of state (EOS). First and foremost, we show that our new efficient approximation for neutrino pair production matches the results of a full treatment very well. Furthermore, for this progenitor, we show that the impact of the modifications is dependent on the EOS used, as the EOS drives the PNS evolution. The variations we explore, including variations due to the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung formalism, have a comparatively smaller impact than the EOS has as a whole.","['Aurore Betranhandy', ""Evan O'Connor""]",12.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17141,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-29
Feedback and dynamical masses in high-$z$ galaxies: the advent of high-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy,"Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\leq z\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}$, with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.","['A. Saldana-Lopez', 'J. Chisholm', 'S.

Non-halo structures and their effects on gravitationally lensed galaxies,"While the $\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on smaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark matter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence gravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the dark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form and thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter (WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\chi}$ = 3 keV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally excluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal velocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for first-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed systems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these simulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a smooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations from WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of the main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these variations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical power-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic lensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a strong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing analyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that while non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact remains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and CDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.","['Baptiste Jego', 'Giulia Despali', 'Tamara Richardson', 'Jens Stücker']",10.0,4.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17147,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['dark matter – gravitational lensing: strong 1', 'cosmology: large-scale structure of the Universe']",2025-01-29
Line-of-sight effects on double source plane lenses,"Weak gravitational lensing perturbations have a non-negligible impact on strong lensing observables, and several degeneracies exist between the properties of the main lens, line of sight, and cosmology. In this work, we consider the impact of the line of sight on double-source-plane lenses (DSPLs), a rare class of lens systems in which two sources at different redshifts are lensed by the same foreground galaxy, and which enable competitive constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Generating and sampling statistically representative lines of sight from N-body simulations, we show that line-of-sight perturbations add a $\sim1\%$ uncertainty to measurements of the cosmological scaling factor $\eta$ (a ratio of angular diameter distance ratios), which is subdominant but non-negligible compared to the measurement error. We also show that the line-of-sight shear experienced by images of the two sources can differ significantly in both magnitude and direction. Including a line-of-sight error budget, we measure $w=-1.17^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$ from the Jackpot DSPL in combination with Planck. We show that the line of sight is expected to introduce an additional scatter in the constraints possible with a larger sample of DSPLs from Euclid, but that this scatter is subdominant compared to other sources of error.","['Daniel Johnson', 'Thomas Collett', 'Tian Li', 'Pierre Fleury']",6.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17153,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-29
Keck and Gemini characterization of $Hayabusa2\#$ rendezvous target 1998 KY$_{26}$,"Near-earth asteroid (NEA) 1998 KY$_{26}$ is a target of the $Hayabusa2\#$ spacecraft, which it will rendezvous with in July 2031. The asteroid has been noted to rotate rapidly and has a large out-of-plane nongravitational acceleration. We present observations consisting of deep g and R band imaging obtained with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and visible spectroscopy from Gemini North /Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (Gemini N/GMOS) taken of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on 2024 June 8-9 when the asteroid was $\sim$0.037 au from the Earth. The asteroid lacks the appearance of a dust coma and has a surface brightness profile similar to nearby background stars in the deep images. The spectrum of 1998 KY$_{26}$ from the combined LRIS/GMOS observations most closely resembles Xe-types possessing a spectral slope of 6.71$\pm$0.43 $\%$ 100 nm$^{-1}$, and color indices: g-r = 0.63$\pm$0.03, r-i = 0.15$\pm$0.03, i-z = 0.05$\pm$0.04. From our deep image stacks, we compute a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the dust production of 1998 KY$_{26}$ of $<$10$^{-5}$ kg s$^{-1}$, $<$10$^{-2}$ kg s$^{-1}$, and $<$10$^{-1}$ kg s$^{-1}$ assuming $\mathrm{\mu}$m, mm, and cm size dust particles. In addition, we compare the orbit of 1998 KY$_{26}$ and other known asteroids with large nongravitational parameters with NEA population models, finding the majority, including 1998 KY$_{26}$, likely originated from the inner Main Belt, while the second most numerous group originates from the outer Main Belt, followed by a third group possibly originating from the Jupiter Family Comet population. Given its inner Main Belt origin, its Xe-type, and rapid rotation, we hypothesize that the nongravitational acceleration of 1998 KY$_{26}$ may be caused by the shedding of large dust grains from its surface due to its rotation rather than H$_2$O vapor outgassing.","['Bryce T.

A novel inversion algorithm for weak gravitational lensing using quasi-conformal geometry,"One of the challenges in weak gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters is to infer the projected mass density distribution from gravitational lensing measurements, which is known as inversion problem. We introduce a novel theoretical approach to solve the inversion problem. The cornerstone of the proposed method lies in a complex formalism that describes the lens mapping as quasi-conformal mapping with the Beltrami coefficient given by the negative of the reduced shear, which is, in principle, observable from the image ellipticities. We propose an algorithm called QCLens that is based on this complex formalism. QCLens computes the underlying quasi-conformal mapping with a finite element approach by reducing the problem to two elliptic partial differential equations solely depending on the reduced shear field. Experimental results for both the Schwarzschild and singular isothermal lens demonstrate the agreement of our proposed method with the analytically computable solutions.",['Jan Jakob'],5.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17157,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,['astrophysics: observations /techniques: quasi-conformal mappings /methods: elliptic PDE inversion /gravitational lensing: weak 1'],2025-01-29
Nonlinear fitting of undersampled discrete datasets in astronomy,"Data analysis and interpretation often relies on an approximation of an empirical dataset by some analytic functions or models. Actual implementations usually rely on a non-linear multi-dimensional optimization algorithm, typically Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) or other flavors of Newtonian gradient methods. A vast majority of datasets in optical and infrared astronomy are represented by values on a discrete grid because the actual signal is sampled by regularly shaped pixels in the light detectors. Here we come to the main problem of nearly all widely used implementations of nonlinear optimization methods: the function that is being fitted is evaluated at central pixel positions rather than integrated over the pixel areas. Therefore, the best-fitting set of parameters returned by the minimization routine might not be the best representation of the observed dataset, especially if a dataset is undersampled. For example, a central pixel of a 1D Gaussian with a dispersion of 1 pix (2.36 pix FWHM; so not too strongly undersampled) will be about 4.2% lower than its central evaluated value if integrated. To handle this effect properly, one needs to perform numerical or analytic integration of a model within the pixel boundaries. We will discuss possible computationally efficient solutions and test our preliminary implementation of a nonlinear fitting using LM minimization that correctly accounts for the discrete nature of the data.","['Igor Chilingarian', 'Kirill Grishin']",2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17163,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,PRD 111 (2025) 023540,[],2025-01-29
Model Evaluation of a Transformable CubeSat for Nonholonomic Attitude Reorientation Using a Drop Tower,"This paper presents a design for a drop tower test to evaluate a numerical model for a structurally reconfigurable spacecraft with actuatable joints, referred to as a transformable spacecraft. A mock-up robot for a 3U-sized transformable spacecraft is designed to fit in a limited time and space of the microgravity environment available in the drop tower. The robot performs agile reorientation, referred to as nonholonomic attitude control, by actuating joints in a particular manner. To adapt to the very short duration of microgravity in the drop tower test, a successive joint actuation maneuver is optimized to maximize the amount of attitude reorientation within the time constraint. The robot records the angular velocity history of all four bodies, and the data is analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. We confirm that the constructed numerical model sufficiently replicates the robot's motion and show that the post-experiment model corrections further improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Finally, the difference between this drop tower test and the actual orbit demonstration is discussed to show the prospect.","['Yuki Kubo', 'Tsubasa Ando', 'Hirona Kawahara', 'Shu Miyata', 'Naoya Uchiyama', 'Kazutoshi Ito', 'Yoshiki Sugawara']",20.0,22.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17173,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Robotics'],,,"['Reconfigurable spacecraft', 'Attitude reorientation', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'CubeSat 1arXiv:2501', 'Nonholonomic system', 'Drop tower test']",2025-01-30

A careful analysis of the astrometric orbits and spectral energy distributions isolates 33 main-sequence (MS) stars with highly likely WD companions. By combining cluster age estimates, dynamically measured WD masses, and, where available, WD cooling temperatures, we derive progenitor masses for 26 WD candidates. Our analysis suggests the presence of two distinct WD populations: (i) low-mass WDs, likely shaped by binary interactions during the progenitor's red-giant phase; and (ii) ""spender"" WDs, which experienced higher-than-expected mass loss and have progenitor masses above the IFMR predictions. The rest of the candidates, referred to as the ""others"", represent systems with inconclusive formation mechanisms. We suggest that at least some of these systems might be hierarchical triples, where the companion to the MS is a double WD or a double-WD merger product. However, follow-up studies are required to determine the nature of each case. These results highlight significant deviations from the IFMR derived for isolated WDs, emphasizing the role of binary evolution. Follow-up observations, particularly in the far-ultraviolet, are crucial for refining these findings and advancing our understanding of mass transfer processes and binary evolution pathways.","['Oren Ironi', 'Sagi Ben-Ami', ""Na'ama Hallakoun"", 'Sahar Shahaf']",16.0,24.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17220,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ- this is the revised version after the first referee report,,['white dwarfs — binaries: general — astrometry — stellar evolution — stars: AGB and post-AGB 1'],2025-01-30
Shock-cooling Constraints via Early-time Observations of the Type IIb SN 2022hnt,"We report the results of a rapid follow-up campaign on the Type IIb Supernova (SN) 2022hnt. We present a daily, multi-band, photometric follow-up using the Las Cumbres Observatory, the Zwicky Transient Facility, the orbiting \textit{Swift} observatory, and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). A distinctive feature in the light curve of SN 2022hnt and other IIb SNe is an early narrow peak prior to the ${}^{56}$Ni peak caused by rapid shock cooling of the hydrogen envelope, which can serve as an important probe of the properties of the massive progenitor star in the moments before explosion. Using SN 2022hnt as a case study, we demonstrate a framework of considerations for the application of shock cooling models to type IIb SNe, outlining a consistent procedure for future surveys of Type IIb SNe progenitor and explosion properties. \hll{We fit several recent models of shock-cooling emission and obtain progenitor radii between $\sim50$ and $\sim100$ $R_\odot$, as well as hydrogen-enriched envelope masses between $\sim0.01$ and $\sim0.1$ $M_\odot$, both consistent with values for other IIb SNe. One of these models is the model of \cite{Morag2023}, marking the first time this model has been applied to a Type IIb SN.} We evaluate contrasting predictions between shock-cooling models to construct a fiducial parameter set which can be used for comparison to other SNe. Finally, we investigate the possibility of extended wind breakout or precursor emission captured in the earliest detections.","['Joseph R. Farah', 'D.

BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN,"We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1"" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.","['Macon Magno', 'Krista L.

Tidal tails of nearby open clusters I. Mapping with Gaia DR3,"Context: Tidal tails of open clusters are the result of stellar evaporation from the cluster through the Galactic potential and internal dynamics. With the recent availability of high-precision data, tidal tails are being detected for most of the nearby open clusters. Aims: We identify the tidal tail members for all open clusters within a distance of 400 pc that are older than 100 Myr and have $>$100 members. To do this, we use model-independent methods. Methods: We used the convergent-point (CP) method to identify the co-moving stars near the open clusters using Gaia DR3 data. A new method called the self-compact convergent-point (SCCP) method was proposed and applied to some of the clusters. It performed better overall in tracing the tails. We also analysed the colour-magnitude diagrams and orbital energy to diagnose possible contamination. Results: Nineteen out of 21 clusters have tidal tails. Five of them were discovered for the first time through this work. The typical span of the tidal tails is 20--200 pc, and 30--700 member stars lie in the region inside the tidal radius and the tidal tails. Four out of 19 tidal tails are tilted away from direction of the Galactic centre. This contradicts the known theory of the tidal-tail formation. The luminosity functions of the tails and clusters are consistent with each other and with the canonical stellar interstellar mass function, but systematically higher radial velocities for the trailing tail than for the leading tail were observed for the first time. Conclusions: The CP method is useful for detecting tidal tails on a scale of approx. 100 pc for clusters closer than 400 pc. A further analysis of theoretical N-body models is required to understand the incompleteness and biases in the current sample of tidal tails.","['Dhanraj Risbud', 'Vikrant V.

The assembly of supermassive black holes at $z<1$ in early-type galaxies from scaling relations,"The assembly of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\bullet}$) and stellar mass ($M_{*}$) in galaxies can be studied via the redshift evolution of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, but the ways in which selection bias and physical assembly channels affect this evolution are uncertain. To address this, we compare the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation for local massive ($M_{*}>10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs) to that for massive ETGs hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim0.8$. The restrictions on stellar mass and galaxy type limit the assembly channels that may connect the two relations. For the local sample we find $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.80 + 1.10(\log{M_{*}-11})$, in line with prior work. For the $z\sim0.8$ sample we find a bias-corrected relation: $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 7.80 + 1.25(\log{M_{*}-11})$. We show, however, that this relation depends on the stellar and SMBH mass functions used to compute the selection bias, the virial relation, the virial factor, and the active fraction, which together introduce uncertainty of up to $\sim0.6$\,dex in the $z\sim0.8$ relation. Adopting reasonable choices of these parameters then our $z\sim0.8$ relation lies above that for $z\sim0$ AGN by $\sim0.5$\,dex, but below our $z\sim0$ ETG relation by $0.4-1$\,dex in SMBH mass. We discuss possible sources of this offset, including further bias corrections, `downsizing"" in SMBH mass assembly, and preferential SMBH growth. Our results highlight the need to reduce uncertainties from selection and measurement bias in SMBH and stellar masses at all redshifts.","['Duncan Farrah', 'Athena Engholm', 'Evanthia Hatziminaoglou', 'Sara Petty', 'Francesco Shankar', 'Andreas Efstathiou', 'Kiana Ejercito', 'Kirsten Jones', 'Mark Lacy', 'Carol Lonsdale', 'Chris Pearson', 'Gregory Tarle', 'Rogier Windhorst', 'Jose Afonso', 'David L.

"Dynamics of small, constant size particles in a protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet","Hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disk dynamics are useful tools for understanding the formation of planetary systems, including our own. Approximations are necessary to make these simulations computationally tractable. A common assumption when simulating dust fluids is that of a constant Stokes number, a dimensionless number that characterizes the interaction between a particle and the surrounding gas. Constant Stokes number is not a good approximation in regions of the disk where the gas density changes significantly, such as near a planet-induced gap. In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant Stokes number in the popular FARGO3D code using semi-analytic equations for the drag force on dust particles, which enables an assumption of constant particle size instead. We explore the effect this change has on disk morphology and particle fluxes across the gap for both outward- and inward-drifting particles. The assumption of constant particle size, rather than constant Stokes number, is shown to make a significant difference in some cases, emphasizing the importance of the more accurate treatment.","['Ellen M.

Reconstructing parametric gravitational-wave population fits from non-parametric results without refitting the data,"Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.","['Cecilia Maria Fabbri', 'Davide Gerosa', 'Alessandro Santini', 'Matthew Mould', 'Alexandre Toubiana', 'Jonathan Gair']",4.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17233,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,[],2025-01-30
A Detailed Analysis of Close Binary OCs,"In this study, we analyzed the close binary open clusters CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, which are in close spatial proximity, using photometric and astrometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 catalog. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), resulting in 106 and 146 members for CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, respectively. The mean proper motion components ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta$, $\mu_{\delta}$) were determined to be (0.646$\pm$0.155, -0.769$\pm$0.124) mas yr$^{-1}$ for CWNU 2666, and (0.665$\pm$0.131, -0.728$\pm$0.107) mas yr$^{-1}$ for HSC 224. The isochrone distances ($d_{\rm iso}$) were estimated as 1885$\pm$44 pc for CWNU 2666 and 1866$\pm$29 pc for HSC 224. The corresponding cluster ages ($t$) were derived as 160$\pm$15 Myr and 140$\pm$15 Myr, respectively.

Joint inference of the Milky Way star formation history and IMF from Gaia all-sky $G < 13$ data,"Despite the fundamental importance of the star formation history (SFH) and the initial mass function (IMF) in the description of the Milky Way, their consistent and robust derivation is still elusive. Recent and accurate astrometry and photometry collected by the Gaia satellite provide the natural framework to consolidate these ingredients in our local Galactic environment. We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic disc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besançon population synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of the systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models on this inference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations (BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G<13$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent BGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation approximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide plateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr ago with a $\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex and discrepant evolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but discrepant values are found for the power-law indices of the IMF. For the range 0.5-1.53 $M_\odot$ the slope takes a value of $\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$, while for masses larger than 1.53 $M_\odot$ we obtain $\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$. The current implementation of the BGM FASt framework is ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up to 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude. This will naturally allow us to derive both a reliable SFH for the early epochs of the Galactic disc evolution and a precise slope for the IMF at low masses.","['Marc del Alcázar-Julià', 'Francesca Figueras', 'Annie C.

The First SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Characterization of clusters of galaxies misclassified in the eRASS1 point source catalog,"The detection of the extended X-ray-emission of the intracluster medium by the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), combined with optical and near-infrared follow-up, resulted in the identification of more than 12000 galaxy clusters, yielding precise constraints on cosmological parameters. However, some clusters of galaxies can be misclassified as point sources by eROSITA's source detection algorithm due to the interplay between the point-spread function, the shallow depth of the survey, compact (cool core) X-ray emission, and bright active galactic nuclei hosted in their centers or their vicinity. To identify such misclassified galaxy clusters and groups, we apply optical follow-up to the eRASS1 X-ray point sources analogously to the treatment of the extent-selected catalog. After rigorous filtering to ensure purity, we find a total of 8347 clusters of galaxies, of which 5819 are novel detections, in a redshift range $0.05 < z \lesssim 1.1$. This corresponds to a 70 % discovery rate, a fraction similar to that of the extent-selected sample. To facilitate finding new exceptional clusters such as the Phoenix cluster (which is recovered in our sample), we divide the clusters into five classes based on the optical properties of likely single-source counterparts to the X-ray emission. We further investigate potential biases in our selection process by analyzing the optical and X-ray data. With this work, we provide a catalog of galaxy clusters and groups in the eRASS1 point source catalog, including their optical and X-ray properties along with a meaningful classification.","['F.

The impact of cosmic ray feedback during the epoch of reionisation,"Galaxies form and evolve via a multitude of complex physics. In this work, we investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution and reionisation, by examining its impact on the escape of ionising radiation from galaxies. For this purpose, we present two Sphinx cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, allowing for the first time a study of the impact of CR feedback on thousands of resolved galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). The simulations differ in their feedback prescriptions: one adopts a calibrated strong supernova (SN) feedback, while the other simulation reduces the strength of SN feedback and includes CR feedback instead. We show that both comparably regulate star formation, reasonably match observations of high-redshift UV luminosity functions, and produce a similar amount of hydrogen ionising photons. In contrast to the model with strong SN feedback, the model with CRs lead to incomplete reionisation, which is in strong disagreement with observational estimates of the reionisation history. This is due to CR feedback shaping the ISM differently, filling with gas the low density cavities otherwise carved by SN explosions. As a result, this reduces the escape of ionising photons, at any halo mass, and primarily in the close vicinity of the stars. Our study indicates that CR feedback regulates galaxy growth during the EoR, but negatively affects reionisation, a tension which paves the way for further exploration and refinement of existing galaxy formation and feedback models. Such improvements are crucial in order to capture and understand the process of reionisation and the underlying evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.","['Marion Farcy', 'Joakim Rosdahl', 'Yohan Dubois', 'Jérémy Blaizot', 'Sergio Martin-Alvarez', 'Martin Haehnelt', 'Taysun Kimm', 'Romain Teyssier']",11.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17239,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['cosmology: reionisation – cosmology: early Universe – cosmic rays – galaxies: evolution – methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-30
Carving the Edges of the Rocky Planet Population,"Short-period planets provide ideal laboratories for testing star-planet interaction. Planets that are smaller than $\sim$2$R_\oplus$ are considered to be largely rocky either having been stripped of or never having acquired the gaseous envelope. Zooming in on these short-period rocky planet population, clear edges appear in the mass-period and radius-period space. Over $\sim$0.2--20 days and 0.09--1.42$M_\odot$, the maximum mass of the rocky planets stay below $\sim$10$M_\oplus$ with a hint of decrease towards $\lesssim$1 day, $\gtrsim$4 day, and $\lesssim 0.45 M_\odot$. In radius-period space, there is a relative deficit of $\lesssim$2$R_\oplus$ planets inside $\sim$1 day. We demonstrate how the edges in the mass-period space can be explained by a combination of tidal decay and photoevaporation whereas the rocky planet desert in the radius-period space is a signature of magnetic drag on the planet as it orbits within the stellar magnetic field. Currently observed catastrophically evaporating planets may have started their death spiral from $\sim$1 day with planets of mass up to $\sim$0.3$M_\oplus$ under the magnetic drag. More discoveries and characterization of small planets around mid-late M and A stars would be welcome to better constrain the stellar parameters critical in shaping the edges of rocky planet population including their UV radiation history, tidal and magnetic properties.","['Eve J.

r-Process Nucleosynthesis and Radioactively Powered Transients from Magnetar Giant Flares,"We present nucleosynthesis and light-curve predictions for a new site of the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) from magnetar giant flares (GFs). Motivated by observations indicating baryon ejecta from GFs, Cehula et al. (2024) proposed mass ejection occurs after a shock is driven into the magnetar crust during the GF. We confirm using nuclear reaction network calculations that these ejecta synthesize moderate yields of third-peak $r$-process nuclei and more substantial yields of lighter $r$-nuclei, while leaving a sizable abundance of free neutrons in the outermost fastest expanding ejecta layers. The final $r$-process mass fraction and distribution are sensitive to the relative efficiencies of $\alpha$-capture and $n$-capture freeze-outs. We use our nucleosynthesis output in a semi-analytic model to predict the light curves of novae breves, the transients following GFs powered by radioactive decay. For a baryonic ejecta mass similar to that inferred of the 2004 Galactic GF from SGR 1806-20, we predict a peak UV/optical luminosity of $\sim 10^{39}$-$10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\sim 10$-$15$ minutes, rendering such events potentially detectable following a gamma-ray trigger by wide-field transient monitors such as ULTRASAT/UVEX to several Mpc. The peak luminosity and timescale of the transient increase with the GF strength due to the larger ejecta mass. Although GFs likely contribute 1-10% of the total Galactic $r$-process budget, their short delay-times relative to star-formation make them an attractive source to enrich the earliest generations of stars.","['Anirudh Patel', 'Brian D.

"Molecular Gas Heating, Star Formation Rate Relations, and AGN Feedback in Infrared-luminous Galaxy Mergers","We examine the origin of molecular gas heating in a sample of 42 infrared-luminous galaxies at $z<0.3$ by combining two sets of archival data. First, integrated CO line luminosities in the 1-0 and 5-4 through 13-12 transitions. Second, results from radiative transfer modelling that decompose their bolometric emission into starburst, AGN, and host galaxy components. We find that the CO 1-0 and 5-4 through 9-8 lines primarily arise via radiative heating in the starburst and the host galaxy. In contrast, the CO 10-9 through 13-12 lines may arise primarily in the starburst and AGN, with an increasing contribution from mechanical heating and shocks. For the sample as a whole, we find no evidence that AGN luminosity affects the heating of molecular gas by star formation. However, for starbursts with low initial optical depths, a more luminous AGN may reduce the efficiency of starburst heating of the CO 5-4 and above lines, consistent with negative AGN feedback.","['Duncan Farrah', 'Andreas Efstathiou', 'Jose Afonso', 'David L Clements', 'Kevin Croker', 'Evanthia Hatziminaoglou', 'Maya Joyce', 'Vianney Lebouteiller', 'Alaine Lee', 'Carol Lonsdale', 'Chris Pearson', 'Sara Petty', 'Lura K Pitchford', 'Dimitra Rigopoulou', 'Aprajita Verma', 'Lingyu Wang']",7.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17257,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-30
"A closer look at LTT\,9779b: The ESPRESSO endeavour to pierce the atmospheric veil","The proliferation of exoplanet discoveries in exotic environments like the Neptune desert challenges our understanding of planetary atmospheres under intense irradiation. The unexpected discovery of LTT9779 b, an ultra-hot Neptune within this desert, offers a prime opportunity for atmospheric studies. We build on prior observations of LTT9779 b from TESS, Spitzer, and CHEOPS, incorporating new VLT/ESPRESSO data to probe its atmospheric dynamics. Preliminary analyses suggest a metal-rich atmosphere and a high day-side geometric albedo, possibly indicating silicate clouds. Minimal atmospheric escape is observed, contrasting existing models of planetary evolution under extreme irradiation. We obtained the transmission spectrum of LTT9779 b between 0.4 and 0.78 microns with ESPRESSO, addressing systematics across three transits. Our analysis focused on the sodium doublet and H-alpha, using cross-correlation with models containing Na, K, FeH, TiO, and VO. No significant atmospheric signal was detected, with metallicity limits set at [Fe/H] >= 2.25 (>= 180 times solar). The non-detection aligns with a high-metallicity, cloud-free model, implying a high mean molecular weight and reduced atmospheric scale height. We interpret this as evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere with suppressed spectral features, possibly due to high-altitude clouds or hazes. These findings are consistent with JWST observations, supporting the hypothesis of metal-rich atmospheres obscured by aerosols in extreme environments.","['R. Ramírez Reyes', 'James S.

Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter,"Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function.

Broadening of the Main Sequence of a Star Cluster by Undetected Binaries,"This paper is concerned with the spread in apparent magnitudes (or absolute magnitudes) of main-sequence stars in a star cluster. I specifically consider the effect of binary stars in broadening the main sequence. I present analytic and semi-analytic expressions for the probability density function (pdf) of the magnitude at a given photometric color, including the effects of binarity. The expressions obtained employ plausible models for the pdfs of the magnitudes of the primary and secondary stars, as well as the distribution of secondary-to-primary mass ratio. A crucial parameter is the fraction of stars in the star cluster that are binaries. The resultant formulas can be used to determine the fraction of binaries in a sample of stars taken from a star cluster, or to limit long term variations in the luminosity of solar type stars.",['Steven R.

Testing Cluster Membership of Planetary Nebulae with High-Precision Proper Motions. II. HST Observations of PHR J1315-6555 in the Open Cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04),"Planetary nebulae (PNe) shown to be members of star clusters provide information on their properties and evolutionary histories that cannot be determined for PNe in the field, in particular the initial masses of their progenitor stars. Here we investigate the bipolar PN PHR J1315-6555 (hereafter PHR J1315), which lies near the open cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04) on the sky. Previous work has established that the PN and cluster have similar radial velocities and amounts of interstellar reddening, and similar distances estimated using independent methods. We have obtained new images of the PN and cluster using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Combined with archival HST frames taken 12 years earlier, they provide high-precision proper motions (PMs) for two candidate central stars of PHR J1315. We find that the PMs of both candidates are consistent with those of cluster members, strongly confirming the PN's membership in AL 1. The candidate lying closer to the center of PHR J1315 has the color and luminosity of an early F-type dwarf, suggesting that it may be the optical primary in a close post-common-envelope binary. We used the HST data to construct a color-magnitude diagram for AL 1, which we corrected for significant foreground differential reddening. Isochrone fitting reveals that the cluster lies at a remarkably large distance of about 13 kpc, and has an age of about 1.0 Gyr. The initial mass of the progenitor of PHR J1315 was about 2.1 Msun. We suggest followup investigations that would provide tighter constraints on the object's evolution.","['Andrea Bellini', 'Howard E. Bond', 'Kailash C.

The collisionless hydrodynamics: On the nonexistence of collisionless shocks,"Collisionless shocks, essential for astrophysics, perhaps do not exist as statistically stationary solutions. If so, any quantitative statement about a collisionless shock should be qualified by the age of the shock.A theoretical description of the upstream of the 1+1 dimensional electrostatic collisionless shock is developed -- collisionless hydrodynamics. Peculiarities of collisionless hydrodynamics prevent a shock formation when a piston is driven into cold plasma. An exact self-similar solution is found instead; the spatial extent of the solution grows linearly in time.Direct numerical simulations of plasma kinetics in 1+1 dimensions confirm the hydrodynamic result -- a statistically steady collisionless shock doesn't exist. Instead, at each fixed time, there is a continuous succession in space of marginally stable velocity distribution functions. The spatial support of this continuous succession grows linearly in time.",['Andrei Gruzinov'],5.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17341,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-30
Carving Out the Inner Edge of the Period Ratio Distribution through Giant Impacts,"The distribution of orbital period ratios between adjacent observed exoplanets is approximately uniform, but exhibits a strong falloff toward close orbital separations. We show that this falloff can be explained through past dynamical instabilities carving out the period ratio distribution. Our suite of numerical experiments would have required $\sim 3$ million CPU-hours through direct N-body integrations, but was achieved with only $\approx 50$ CPU-hours by removing unstable configurations using the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) machine learning model. This highlights the role of dynamical instabilities in shaping the observed exoplanet population, and shows that the inner part of the period ratio distribution provides a valuable observational anchor on the giant impact phase of planet formation.","['Kaitlyn Chen', 'Oswaldo Cardenas', 'Brandon Bonifacio', 'Nikolas Hall', 'Rori Kang', 'Daniel Tamayo']",5.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17359,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-30
Observing Rayleigh-Taylor stable and unstable accretion through a Kalman filter analysis of X-ray pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"Global, three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized, compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period $P(t)$ and aperiodic X-ray luminosity $L(t)$ time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter $\omega(t)$ and we connect $\omega(t)$ with the three Rayleigh-Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime, and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between $\omega(t)$ and the independently measured pulse amplitude $A(t)$, which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.","[""Joseph O'Leary"", 'Andrew Melatos', 'Tom Kimpson', 'Dimitris M.

Dark Matter Substructure: A Lensing Perspective,"The study of dark matter substructure through strong gravitational lensing has shown enormous promise in probing the properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. This approach has already been used to place strong constraints on a wide range of dark matter models including self-interacting dark matter, fuzzy dark matter and warm dark matter. A major source of degeneracy exists between suppression of low mass halos due to novel dark matter physics and the strength of tidal stripping experienced by subhalos. We study theoretical predictions for the statistical properties of subhalos in strong gravitational lenses using the semi-analytic galaxy formation toolkit: \galns. We present a large suite of dark matter only \gal models, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in host halo mass (from Milky Way to group mass halos between redshifts from $0.2$ to $0.8$). Additionally, we include a smaller set of \gal runs with the potential of a central massive elliptical to complement our dark matter only suite of models. We place particular focus on quantities relevant to strong gravitational lensing; namely the projected number density of substructure near the Einstein radius as function of host stellar mass and redshift. In the innermost region in projection, we find that our \gal models agrees with N-body simulations within a factor of $\sim 2$ within the Einstein radius. We find that the addition of a central galaxy suppresses the projected number density of subhalos within in the Einstein radius by around $15\%$ relative to dark matter only simulations.","['Charles Gannon', 'Anna Nierenberg', 'Andrew Benson', 'Ryan Keeley', 'Xiaolong Du', 'Daniel Gilman']",6.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17362,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-30
"Tidal disruption of ""snow clouds"" by unassociated stars","It has been suggested that star-forming galaxies may host a substantial, dark reservoir of gas in the form of planetary-mass molecular clouds that are so cold that $\text{H}_{2}$ can condense. Here we investigate the process of tidal disruption of such ""snow clouds"" by close passage of field stars. We construct a suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter and Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal debris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured relative to the ambient ISM. They are also unusual in their composition -- initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with $\text{H}_{2}$ ""snowballs"" that may be as much as a metre in size. Each stream expands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it ploughs through the ISM; the snowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through the shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of the ""scattering screens"" revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However, the tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of scattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior physical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters between stars and clouds.","['Arthur G.

Multi-messenger Emission by Magnetically Arrested Disks and Relativistic Jets of Black Hole X-ray Binaries,"Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are observed in various wavelengths from radio to GeV gamma-ray. Several BHXBs, including MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1, are also found to emit ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $>$100 TeV) gamma rays. The origin and production mechanism of the multi-wavelength emission of BHXBs are under debate. We propose a scenario where relativistic particles from magnetically arrested disks (MADs), which could form when BHXBs are in quiescent or hard states, produce UHE gamma rays, while electrons in the jets produce GeV gamma-ray emission. Specifically, magnetic turbulence in MADs heats up and accelerates electrons and protons, while magnetic reconnection in jets accelerates electrons. Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when relativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by thermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV multi-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the integrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that BHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\sim 100$ TeV.","['Riku Kuze', 'Shigeo S.

"A Heliocentric-orbiting Objects Processing System (HOPS) for the Wide Field Survey Telescope: Architecture, Processing Workflow, and Preliminary Results","Wide-field surveys have markedly enhanced the discovery and study of solar system objects (SSOs). The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) represents the foremost facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the northern hemisphere. To fully exploit WFST's capabilities for SSO detection, we have developed a heliocentric-orbiting objects processing system (HOPS) tailored for identifying these objects. This system integrates HelioLinC3D, an algorithm well suited for the WFST survey cadence, characterized by revisiting the same sky field twice on the majority of nights. In this paper, we outline the architecture and processing flow of our SSO processing system. The application of the system to the WFST pilot survey data collected between March and May 2024 demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of both temporal efficiency and completeness. A total of 658,489 observations encompassing 38,520 known asteroids have been documented, and 241 newly discovered asteroids have been assigned provisional designations. In particular, 27% of these new discoveries were achieved using merely two observations per night on three nights. The preliminary results not only illuminate the effectiveness of integrating HelioLinC3D within the SSO processing system, but also emphasize the considerable potential contributions of WFST to the field of solar system science.","['Shao-Han Wang', 'Bing-Xue Fu', 'Jun-Qiang Lu', 'LuLu Fan', 'Min-Xuan Cai', 'Ze-Lin Xu', 'Xu Kong', 'Haibin Zhao', 'Bin Li', 'Ya-Ting Liu', 'Qing-feng Zhu', 'Xu Zhou', 'Zhen Wan', 'Jingquan Cheng', 'Ji-an Jiang', 'Feng Li', 'Ming Liang', 'Hao Liu', 'Wentao Luo', 'Zhen Lou', 'Hairen Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Tinggui Wang', 'Yongquan Xue', 'Hongfei Zhang', 'Wen Zhao']",6.0,23.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17472,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics'],,,"['Clustering (1908) 1', 'Astronomy data analysis (1858)', 'Near-Earthobjects(1092)', 'Asteroids(72)', 'SmallSolarSystembodies(1469)']",2025-01-30
Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) VI. Evidence of disk-wind in G11.92-0.61 MM1,"Magnetohydrodynamic disk-winds play a key role in the formation of massive stars by providing the fine-tuning between accretion and ejection, where excess angular momentum is redirected away from the disk, allowing further mass growth. However, only a limited number of disk-wind sources have been detected to date. To better constrain the exact mechanism of this phenomenon, expanding the sample is critical. We performed an analysis of the disk-wind candidate G11.92-0.61 MM1 by estimating the physical parameters of the system and constraining the wind-launching mechanism. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations were conducted in September 2021 with ALMA's longest baselines, which provided a synthesised beam of $\sim$30 mas. We obtained high-resolution images of the CH$_3$CN ($v_8=1$ and $v=0$), CH$_3$OH, SO$_2$, and SO molecular lines, and the 1.3 mm continuum. Our molecular data allowed us to refine the parameters of the disk-outflow system in MM1. The rotating disk is resolved into two regions with distinct kinematics: the inner region ($<$300 au) is traced by high-velocity emission of high-excitation CH$_3$CN lines and shows a Keplerian rotation; the outer region ($>$300 au), traced by mid-velocity CH$_3$CN emission, rotates in a sub-Keplerian regime. The central source is estimated to be $\sim$20 $M_{\odot}$, which is about half the mass estimated in previous lower-resolution studies. A strong collimated outflow is traced by SO and SO$_2$ emission up to $\sim$3400 au around MM1a. The SO and SO$_2$ emissions show a rotation-dominated velocity pattern, a constant specific angular momentum, and a Keplerian profile that suggests a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind origin with launching radii of $\sim$50-100 au. G11.92-0.61 MM1 appears to be one of the clearest cases of molecular line-traced disk-winds detected around massive protostars.","['O. S. Bayandina', 'L. Moscadelli', 'R. Cesaroni', 'M. T.

Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- II. Critical halo mass and core mass function,"The formation and mass distribution of the first stars depend on various environmental factors in the early universe. We compare 120 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore how the baryonic streaming velocity (SV) relative to dark matter affects the formation of the first stars. We vary SV from zero to three times its cosmic root-mean-square value, $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV}=0-3$, and identify 20 representative halos from cosmological simulations. For each model, we follow the evolution of a primordial star-forming cloud from the first appearance of a dense core (with gas density > $10^{6}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) until 2 Myr later. In each model, higher SV systematically delays the formation of primordial clouds, formed inside more massive halos ($10^{5}-10^{7}\,{\rm M}_\odot$), and promotes cloud-scale fragmentation and multiple-core formation. The number and total mass of dense cores increase with increasing SV. More than half of models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \ge 1.5$ form three or more dense cores in a single halo. In extreme cases, up to 25 cores form at once, which leaves a massive first star cluster. On the other hand, models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \leq 1$ form only one or two cores in a halo. In addition, HD-cooling is often enabled in models with low SV, especially in low-z, where HD-cooling is enabled in more than 50% of models. This leads to the formation of the low-mass first star. SV shapes the resulting initial mass function of the first stars and plays a critical role in setting the star-forming environment of the first galaxies.",['Shingo Hirano'],13.0,17.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17491,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['methods: numerical – dark ages', 'or Population III (Pop III) s tars', 'ﬁrst stars – s tars: Population III – stars: formation – stars: black holes 1 INTRODUCTION The formation of the ﬁrst stars', 'reionization', 'marks a key transition in cosmic history']",2025-01-30
Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities,"Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim \! 100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.","['Shingo Hirano', 'Yuri Aikawa', 'Masahiro N.

Core mass function in view of fractal and turbulent filaments and fibers,"We propose that the core mass function (CMF) can be driven by filament fragmentation. To model a star-forming system of filaments and fibers, we develop a fractal and turbulent tree with a fractal dimension of 2 and a Larson's law exponent ($\beta$) of 0.5. The fragmentation driven by convergent flows along the splines of the fractal tree yields a Kroupa-IMF-like CMF that can be divided into three power-law segments with exponents $\alpha$ = $-0.5$, $-1.5$, and $-2$, respectively. The turnover masses of the derived CMF are approximately four times those of the Kroupa IMF, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 0.25. Adopting $\beta=1/3$, which leads to fractional Brownian motion along the filament, may explain a steeper CMF at the high-mass end, with $\alpha=-3.33$ close to that of the Salpeter IMF. We suggest that the fibers of the tree are basic building blocks of star formation, with similar properties across different clouds, establishing a common density threshold for star formation and leading to a universal CMF.","['Xunchuan Liu', 'Tie Liu', 'Xiaofeng Mai', 'Yu Cheng', 'Sihan Jiao', 'Wenyu Jiao', 'Hongli Liu', 'Siju Zhang']",1.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17502,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['stars: formation — stars: kinematics and dynamics — turbulence — stars: mass function — ISM: clouds 1 INTRODUCTION The Core Mass Function (CMF) is a fundamental con- cept in the study of star formation'],2025-01-30
GECKO Follow-up Observation of the Binary Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger Candidate S230518h,"The gravitational wave (GW) event S230518h is a potential binary neutron star-black hole merger (NSBH) event that was detected during engineering run 15 (ER15), which served as the commissioning period before the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O4a observing run. Despite its low probability of producing detectable electromagnetic emissions, we performed extensive follow-up observations of this event using the GECKO telescopes in the southern hemisphere. Our observation covered 61.7\% of the 90\% credible region, a $\rm 284\:deg^2$ area accessible from the southern hemisphere, reaching a median limiting magnitude of $R=21.6$ mag. In these images, we conducted a systematic search for an optical counterpart of this event by combining a CNN-based classifier and human verification. We identified 128 transient candidates, but no significant optical counterpart was found that could have caused the GW signal. Furthermore, we provide feasible KN properties that are consistent with the upper limits of observation.

The growth of super-large pre-planetary pebbles to an impact erosion limit,"Early dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is dominated by sticking collisions. However, this initial phase of particle growth faces constraints - notably from destructive encounters. To find the maximum particle size achievable, we studied collisional processes during a prolonged microgravity experiment aboard a suborbital flight. Here, we specifically report an impact erosion limit. We observed individual basalt beads, each measuring 0.5 mm in diameter, colliding with and either eroding or adhering to a cluster several centimeters in size. This cluster, formed from tribocharged particles, simulates an electrostatic growth phase that surpasses the classical bouncing barrier. We find a threshold velocity of about 0.5 m/s, distinguishing between additive and erosive impacts of individual beads. Numerical simulations of grain impacts into clusters, testing both low and high charge constituents corroborate the experimental findings of surface erosion within the observed velocity range. This specific velocity threshold suggests the potential formation of pebbles several centimeters in size within protoplanetary disks. Such dimensions place these pebbles well into a regime where hydrodynamic interaction might facilitate the formation of planetesimals.","['J. Teiser', 'J. Penner', 'K. Joeris', 'F. C. Onyeagusi', 'J.

"The current cratering rate on the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus","We aim to compute the impact rates for objects with a diameter of 1 km onto the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus using our latest dynamical simulations of the evolution of outer solar system coupled with the best estimates of the current population of objects beyond Neptune and their size-frequency distribution. We use the outcome of the last 3.5~Gyr of evolution of the outer solar system from our database of simulations and combine this with observational constraints of the population beyond Neptune to compute the flux of objects entering the Centaur region, with uncertainties. The initial conditions resemble the current population rather than a near-circular, near-planar disc usually assumed just before the onset of giant planet migration. We obtain a better estimate of the impact probability of a Centaur with the satellites from enacting simulations of planetesimals flying past the satellites on hyperbolic orbits, which agree with literature precedents. We find that our impact rate of objects greater than 1 km in diameter with Jupiter is 0.0012/yr, which is a factor of 3--6 lower than previous estimates of 0.0044/yr from Nesvorny et al. (2023) and 0.0075/yr from Zahnle et al. (2003). On the other hand our impact probabilities with the satellites scaled to the giant planets are consistent with these earlier literature estimates, as is the leakage rate of objects from beyond Neptune into the Centaur region. However, our absolute impact probabilities with the giant planets are lower. We attribute this to our choice of initial conditions.","['R. Brasser', 'E. W. Wong', 'S. C.

Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations,"Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.","['Gabriel Torralba Paz', 'Artem Bohdan', 'Jacek Niemiec']",17.0,20.0,11.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17537,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Computational Physics', 'Plasma Physics']",,,[],2025-01-30
Detection of Oscillation-like Patterns in Eclipsing Binary Light Curves using Neural Network-based Object Detection Algorithms,"The primary aim of this research is to evaluate several convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithms for identifying oscillation-like patterns in light curves of eclipsing binaries. This involves creating a robust detection framework that can effectively process both synthetic light curves and real observational data. The study employs several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Single Shot MultiBox Detector, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, You Only Look Once, and EfficientDet besides a custom non-pretrained model implemented from scratch. Synthetic light curve images and images derived from observational TESS light curves of known eclipsing binaries with a pulsating component were constructed with corresponding annotation files using custom scripts. The models were trained and validated on established datasets, followed by testing on unseen {\it{Kepler}} data to assess their generalization performance. The statistical metrics are also calculated to review the quality of each model. The results indicate that the pre-trained models exhibit high accuracy and reliability in detecting the targeted patterns. Faster R-CNN and You Only Look Once, in particular, showed superior performance in terms of object detection evaluation metrics on the validation dataset such as mAP value exceeding 99\%. Single Shot MultiBox Detector, on the other hand, is the fastest although it shows slightly lower performance with a mAP of 97\%.

A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Ultralarge Cosmological N-body Simulations,"We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.","['Tomoaki Ishiyama', 'Shingo Hirano']",10.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17540,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,"['reionization', 'first stars — dark matter — methods: numerical 1', 'early universe — dark ages']",2025-01-30
Can circumstellar interaction explain the strange light curve features of Type Ib/c supernovae?,"Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while others prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter could significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects. To better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar interaction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed.Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an extreme episodic $\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before the supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general light curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae.Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of both single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via MESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close, low-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks before the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared our results with some observational data.Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could indicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary system or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study also shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for the strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of some Type Ib/c supernovae.","['Andrea P.

HI Intensity Mapping with the MIGHTEE Survey: First Results of the HI Power Spectrum,"We present the first results of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum analysis with the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We use data covering $\sim$ 4 square degrees in the COSMOS field using a frequency range 962.5 MHz to 1008.42 MHz, equivalent to HI emission in $0.4<z<0.48$. The data consists of 15 pointings with a total of 94.2 hours on-source. We verify the suitability of the MIGHTEE data for HI intensity mapping by testing for residual systematics across frequency, baselines and pointings. We also vary the window used for HI signal measurements and find no significant improvement using stringent Fourier mode cuts. Averaging in the power spectrum domain, i.e. using incoherent averaging, we calculate the first upper limits from MIGHTEE on the HI power spectrum at scales $0.5 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$. We obtain the best 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 28.6 mK$^{2}$Mpc${^3}$ on $k\sim$2 Mpc$^{-1}$. Our results are consistent with the power spectrum detected with observations in the DEEP2 field with MeerKAT. The data we use here constitutes a small fraction of the MIGHTEE survey and demonstrates that combined analysis of the full MIGHTEE survey can potentially detect the HI power spectrum at $z\lesssim0.5$ in the range $0.1 Mpc^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ or quasi-linear scales.","['Aishrila Mazumder', 'Laura Wolz', 'Zhaoting Chen', 'Sourabh Paul', 'Mario Santos', 'Matt Jarvis', 'Junaid Townsend', 'Srikrishna Sekhar', 'Russ Taylor']",15.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17564,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['cosmology: observations-techniques: interferometric-(cosmology:) large-scale structure of Universe-radio lines: galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION One of the most important objectives of cosmological observations is measuring the distribution and evolution of dark matter in the Universe'],2025-01-30
Hydroxylamine in Astrophysical Ices: IR Spectra and Cosmic Ray-Induced Radiolytic Chemistry,"Gas-phase hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH) has recently been detected within dense clouds in the interstellar medium. However, it is also likely present within interstellar ices, as well as on the icy surfaces of outer Solar System bodies, where it may react to form more complex prebiotic molecules such as amino acids. In this work, we aimed to provide IR spectra of NH$_2$OH in astrophysical ice analogues that will help in the search for this molecule in various astrophysical environments. Furthermore, we aimed to provide quantitative information on the stability of NH$_2$OH upon exposure to ionizing radiation analogous to cosmic rays, as well as on the ensuing chemistry and potential formation of complex prebiotic molecules. Ices composed of NH$_2$OH, H$_2$O, and CO were prepared by vapor deposition and IR spectra were acquired between $4000-500$~cm$^{-1}$ ($2.5-20 \mu$m) prior and during irradiation using 15 keV protons. In interstellar ice analogues, the most prominent IR absorption band of NH$_2$OH is that at about 1188~cm$^{-1}$, which may be a good candidate to use in searches of this species in icy space environments. Calculated effective destruction cross-sections and G-values for the NH$_2$OH-rich ices studied show that NH$_2$OH is rapidly destroyed upon exposure to ionizing radiation (more rapidly than a number of previously studied organic molecules), and that this destruction is slightly enhanced when it is mixed with other icy species. The irradiation of a NH$_2$OH:H$_2$O:CO ternary ice mixture leads to a rich chemistry that includes the formation of simple inorganic molecules such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and H$_2$O$_2$, as well as ammonium salts and, possibly, complex organic molecules relevant to life such as formamide, formic acid, urea, and glycine.","['Belén Maté', 'Ramón J.

XRISM observations of the cooling flow cluster A2029 support heating by mixing,"I argue that the mixing-heating mechanism of the intracluster medium (ICM) is compatible with the new observations by the X-ray telescope XRISM that show the dispersion velocity in the cooling flow cluster of galaxies A2029 to be 169 km/s. Past jets from the central supermassive black hole induced turbulence; the velocity dispersion value indicates that the jets were powerful, as expected in the mixing-heating mechanism. Although the kinetic energy of the ICM turbulence that XRISM finds is short of heating the ICM and counter radiative cooling, the turbulence is fast enough to mix the hot shocked jets' material with the ICM on time scales shorter than the radiative cooling time. The support of the mixing-heating mechanism from determining the turbulent velocity I claim for A2029 is similar to the conclusion from the X-ray observations by the X-ray telescope Hitomi of the Perseus cluster.",['Noam Soker'],1.0,3.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17607,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,Research Notes of the AAS,,['galaxies: clusters: individual: A2029'],2025-01-30
Searching for signatures of Fe II atomic processes in spectra of active galactic nuclei,"We use a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra in order to investigate which atomic processes are responsible for some observed properties of the FeII emission lines and how they are connected with macroscopic physical characteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated relative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative strengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We investigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV FeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into two large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities are in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent (FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than theoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII model, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted independently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that produce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their correlations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of FeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the Eddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that both ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines, which is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical FeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the FeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an increase in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of the process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a complex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical conditions.","['Jelena Kovačević-Dojčinović', 'Ivan Dojčinović', 'Maša Lakićević', 'Luka Č.

Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn. II. A variability census of supermassive black holes across the Universe,"Understanding the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) stands as one of the most important challenges in astrophysics and cosmology, with little current theoretical consensus. Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 years earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analysed. We identify 443, 149, and 78 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2, 2.5 and 3~$\sigma$ in at least one filter. This sample includes 29, 14, and 9 AGN at redshifts $z>6$, when the Universe was $\lesssim900$~Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17\:$mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the co-moving number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}(z)$. At $z = 6 - 9$, $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. At low-$z$ our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17 \:$mag, and we estimate $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 6\times 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.","['Vieri Cammelli', 'Jonathan C. Tan', 'Alice R. Young', 'Matthew J. Hayes', 'Jasbir Singh', 'Richard S.

Rotational Excitation of Vinyl Cyanide by Collisions with Helium Atoms at Low Temperature,"Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.","['Karina Sogomonyan', 'Malek Ben Khalifa', 'Jérôme Loreau']",8.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17679,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-30
Emergence of magnetic flux sheets in the quiet Sun. I. Statistical properties,"Small-scale magnetic flux emergence in the quiet Sun is crucial for maintaining solar magnetic activity. On the smallest scales studied so far, namely within individual granules, two mechanisms have been identified: emergence in tiny magnetic loops and emergence in the form of magnetic flux sheets covering the granule. While there are abundant observations of tiny magnetic loops within granules, the evidence for the emergence of granule-covering magnetic sheets is much more limited. This work aims to statistically analyze magnetic flux sheets, quantify their frequency on the solar surface and their potential contribution to the solar magnetic budget in the photosphere, and investigate the plasma dynamics and granular-scale phenomena associated with their emergence. Using spectro-polarimetric datasets from the solar optical telescope aboard the Hinode satellite and the ground-based Swedish Solar telescope, we developed a two-step method to identify magnetic flux sheet emergence events, detecting magnetic flux patches based on the calculation of the transverse and longitudinal magnetic flux density and associating them with their host granules based on velocity field analysis. We identified 42 events of magnetic flux sheet emergence and characterized their magnetic properties and the associated plasma dynamics of their host granules. Our results align with numerical simulations, indicating a similar occurrence rate. We investigated the relationship between magnetic flux emergence and granular phenomena, finding that flux sheets often emerge in association with standard nascent granules, as well as exploding granules, or granules with granular lanes. In particular, we highlight the potential role of recycled magnetic flux from downflow regions in facilitating flux sheet emergence.","['S. M. Díaz-Castillo', 'C. E. Fischer', 'F.

NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system,"Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, a Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\approx$ 5. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.","['R. I. El-Kholy', 'Z. M.

The evolution of extragalactic peaked-spectrum sources down to 54 megahertz,"Peaked-spectrum (PS) sources, known for their distinct peaked radio spectra, represent a type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among these, megahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources, which exhibit a spectral peak at a frequency of a hundred megahertz, have emerged as a potential tool for identifying high-redshift candidates. However, the potential evolutionary link between the fraction of these sources and redshift remains unclear and requires further investigation. The recent, high sensitivity Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) surveys enable statistical studies of these objects to ultra-low frequencies (< 150 MHz). In this study, we first use the multiradio data to investigate the evolution of spectral index with redshift for 1,187 quasars from the SDSS 16th quasar catalog. For each quasar, we analyze available data from the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) at 54 MHz, High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz, and the Very Large Array (VLA) the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz. We measure the spectral index ($\alpha^{144}_{54}$ and $\alpha^{1400}_{144}$) and find no significant change in their median values with the redshift. Extended sources have steeper spectral indices than compact sources, which is consistent with previous findings. Based on the spectral indices information, we identify MPS sources using these criteria: $\rm \alpha^{144}_{54} >= 0.1$ and $\rm \alpha^{1400}_{144} < 0$, and analyze their properties. We find that the fraction of MPS sources is constant with the redshift ($0.1-4.8$), bolometric luminosity ($\rm 10^{44}-10^{48} erg/s$), and supermassive black hole mass ($\rm 10^{7}-10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$), which suggests that MPS sources have relatively stable physical conditions or formation mechanisms across various evolutionary stages and environments.","['Sai Zhai', 'Anniek J.

The role of cloud particle properties on WASP-39b transmission spectrum based on JWST/NIRSpec observations,"Aerosols are capable of having a huge influence on reflected, emitted and transmitted planetary spectra. The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) using the PRISM mode on board of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is providing valuable data of transit spectra over a wide spectral range that is able to cover the whole contribution of aerosols, potentially disentangling them from other constituents and thus allowing to constrain their properties. We aim to investigate whether NIRSpec/PRISM JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, in addition to being useful to detect and determine the abundance of gases more accurately than any previous instruments, are also capable of studying the physical properties of the aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. We perform nested sampling Bayesian retrievals with MultiNest library. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the Modelled Optical Properties of enSeMbles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) database as tools for the forward simulations and NIRSpec/PRISM JWST previously published observations of WASP-39b as input data. Retrievals indicate that models including an aerosol extinction weakly increasing or sharply decreasing with wavelength are decisively better than those with a flat transmission and that this increased degree of complexity is supported by the kind of data that JWST/NIRSpec can provide. Given other physical constraints from previous works, the scenario of weakly increasing particle extinction is favoured. We also find that this also has an effect on the retrieved gas abundances. JWST observations have the potential to study some physical characteristics of exoplanetary clouds, in particular their overall dependence of transmissivity with wavelength. In fact, it is important to implement more detailed aerosol models as their extinction may affect significantly retrieved molecular abundances.","['J. Roy-Perez', 'S. Pérez-Hoyos', 'N.

Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer: large scale anisotropies and their implications,"We use Spitzer/IRAC deep exposure data covering two significantly larger than before sky areas to construct maps suitable for evaluating source-subtracted fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background (CIB). The maps are constructed using the self-calibration methodology eliminating artifacts to sufficient accuracy and subset maps are selected in each area containing approximately uniform exposures. These maps are clipped and removed of known sources and then Fourier transformed to probe the CIB anisotropies to new larger scales. The power spectrum of the resultant CIB anisotropies is measured from the data to >1 degree revealing the component well above that from remaining known galaxies on scales >1 arcmin. The fluctuations are demonstrated to be free of Galactic and Solar System foreground contributions out to the largest scales measured. We discuss the proposed theories for the origin of the excess CIB anisotropies in light of the new data. Out of these, the model where the CIB fluctuation excess originates from the granulation power due to LIGO-observed primordial black holes as dark matter appears most successful in accounting for all observations related to the measured CIB power amplitude and spatial structure, including the measured coherence between the CIB and unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Finally we point out the use of the data to probe the CIB-CXB cross-power to new scales and higher accuracy. We also discuss the synergy of these data with future CIB programs at shorter near-IR wavelengths with deep wide surveys and sub-arcsecond angular resolution as provided by Euclid and Roman space missions.","['A.

The SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES),"One of the primary objectives of the SPHEREx mission is to understand the origin of molecules such as H2O, CO2, and other volatile compounds at the early stages of planetary system formation. Because the vast majority of these compounds -- typically exceeding 95% -- exist in the solid phase rather than the gaseous phase in the systems of concern here, the observing strategy planned to characterize them is slightly unusual. Specifically, SPHEREx will target highly obscured sources throughout the Milky Way, and observe the species of concern in absorption against background illumination. SPHEREx spectrophotometry will yield ice column density measurements for millions of obscured Milky Way sources of all ages and types. By correlating those column densities with source ages, the SPHEREx mission will shed light on whether those molecules were formed in situ along with their nascent stellar systems, or whether instead they formed elsewhereand were introduced into those systems after their formation. To that end, this work describes version 7.1 of the SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES) for the community. It contains about 8.6 million objects brighter than W2~12 Vega mag over much of the sky, principally within a broad strip running the length of the Milky Way midplane, but also within high-latitude molecular clouds and even the Magellanic Clouds.","['Matthew L.

Multi-wavelength and Environmental Properties of Variability Selected Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei,"We present the multi-wavelength and environmental properties of 37 variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including 30 low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), using a high cadence time-domain survey (ASAS-SN) from a spectroscopic sample of 1218 nearby bright galaxies. We find that high-cadence time-domain surveys uniquely select LLAGNs that do not necessarily satisfy other AGN selection methods, such as X-ray, mid-IR, or BPT methods. In our sample, 3% of them pass the mid-infrared color based AGN selection, 18% pass the X-ray luminosity based AGN selection, and 60% pass the BPT selection. This result is supported by two other LLAGN samples from high-cadence time-domain surveys of TESS and PTF, suggesting that the variability selection method from well-sampled light curves can find AGNs that may not be discovered otherwise. These AGNs can have moderate to small amplitudes of variability from the accretion disk, but, of many of them, with no strong corona, emission lines from the central engine, or accretion power to dominate the mid-IR emission. The X-ray spectra of a sub-sample of bright sources are consistent with a power law model. Upon inspecting the environments of our sample, we find that LLAGNs are more common in denser environments of galaxy clusters in contrast with the trend established in the literature for luminous AGNs at low redshifts, which is broadly consistent with our analysis result for luminous AGNs limited by a smaller sample size. This contrast in environmental properties between LLAGN and luminous AGNs suggests that LLAGNs may have different trigger mechanisms.","['Heechan Yuk', 'Xinyu Dai', 'Marko Mićić']",8.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17844,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-30
Planetesimal formation in a pressure bump induced by infall,"Infall of interstellar material is a potential non-planetary origin of pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks. While pressure bumps arising from other mechanisms have been numerically demonstrated to promote planet formation, the impact of infall-induced pressure bumps remains unexplored. We aim to investigate the potential for planetesimal formation in an infall-induced pressure bump, starting with sub-micrometer-sized dust grains, and to identify the conditions most conducive to triggering this process. We developed a numerical model that integrates axisymmetric infall, dust drift, and dust coagulation, along with planetesimal formation via streaming instability. Our parameter space includes gas viscosity, dust fragmentation velocity, initial disk mass, characteristic disk radius, infall rate and duration, as well as the location and width of the infall region. An infall-induced pressure bump can trap dust from both the infalling material and the outer disk, promoting dust growth. The locally enhanced dust-to-gas ratio triggers streaming instability, forming a planetesimal belt inside the central infall location until the pressure bump is smoothed out by viscous gas diffusion. Planetesimal formation is favored by a massive, narrow streamer infalling onto a low-viscosity, low-mass, and spatially extended disk containing dust with a high fragmentation velocity. This configuration enhances the outward drift speed of dust on the inner side of the pressure bump, while also ensuring the prolonged persistence of the pressure bump. Planetesimal formation can occur even if the infalling material consists solely of gas. A pressure bump induced by infall is a favorable site for dust growth and planetesimal formation, and this mechanism does not require a preexisting massive planet to create the bump.","['Haichen Zhao', 'Tommy Chi Ho Lau', 'Tilman Birnstiel', 'Sebastian M.

The refractory-to-ice ratio in comet 67P: implications on the composition of the comet-forming region of the protoplanetary disk,"Comets, asteroids, and other small bodies are thought to be remnants of the original planetesimal population of the Solar System. As such, their physical, chemical, and isotopic properties hold crucial details on how and where they formed and how they evolved. Yet, placing precise constraints on the formation region of these bodies has been challenging. Data from spacecraft missions have a particularly high potential of addressing the question of the origin of the visited bodies. ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko returned data from the comet for two years on its journey around the Sun. This extensive data set has revolutionised our view on comets and still holds unsolved problems. We use the Rosetta/ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) measurement of the volatile/ice composition and the Rosetta/COSIMA (COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyzer) measurements of the refractory composition of comet 67P. These measurements are combined using a Monte Carlo method. The refractory-to-ice ratio is a free parameter that is constrained a posteriori.Using only the composition, we constrain the refractory-to-ice ratio to $0.5<\chi<1.7$, and derive the bulk elemental abundances for 67P of H, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, S, K, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Kr, and Xe.

Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Trajectory Design Under Operational Uncertainties for DESTINY+ Mission,"DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.","['Naoya Ozaki', 'Yuki Akiyama', 'Akira Hatakeyama', 'Shota Ito', 'Takuya Chikazawa', 'Takayuki Yamamoto']",4.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17867,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Systems and Control', 'Optimization and Control']",,,[],2025-01-31
"A comment on ""Why is the Galactic disk so cool?"", by Hamilton et al","Frankel et al (2020) reported that the rate of diffusion in angular momentum by stars in the disk of the Milky Way was about ten times faster than the rate of heating, which places a stringent requirement on the nature of disk star scattering. In a recent posting, Hamilton et al (2024) integrated orbits of test particles in a Galactic model that included transient spirals, and found that the ratio of the rates heating to radial migration in their calculations was generally larger than reported by Frankel et al. They concluded that the observed slow heating rate poses a significant challenge to dynamical models of the Milky Way and seemed to require revision of our current theories of spiral structure. Here we show that that our earlier models of radial migration we published in 2002, after correction for 3D motion, account naturally for the finding of Frankel et al, but leave little room for additional heating by mechanisms other than transient spirals.","['J A Sellwood', 'J Binney']",10.0,89443.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17907,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Spiral galaxies (1560) — Galaxy structure (622) — Galaxy dynamics ( 591) — Galaxy evolution (594) 1'],2025-01-31
Constraining the Effect of Baryonic Feedback on the Matter Power Spectrum with Fast Radio Bursts,"In the age of large-scale galaxy and lensing surveys, such as DESI, Euclid, Roman and Rubin, we stand poised to usher in a transformative new phase of data-driven cosmology. To fully harness the capabilities of these surveys, it is critical to constrain the poorly understood influence of baryon feedback physics on the matter power spectrum. We investigate the use of a powerful and novel cosmological probe - fast radio bursts (FRBs) - to capture baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum, leveraging simulations from the CAMELS projects, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid. We find that FRB statistics exhibit a strong correlation, independet of the subgrid model and cosmology, with quantities known to encapsulate baryonic impacts on the matter power spectrum, such as baryon spread and the halo baryon fraction. We propose an innovative method utilizing FRB observations to quantify the effects of feedback physics and enhance weak lensing measurements of $S_{8}$. We outline the necessary steps to prepare for the imminent detection of large FRB populations in the coming years, focusing on understanding the redshift evolution of FRB observables and mitigating the effects of cosmic variance.","['Isabel Medlock', 'Daisuke Nagai', 'Daniel Anglés Alcázar', 'Matthew Gebhardt']",6.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17922,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-31
Possible environmental quenching in an interacting LRD pair at $z\sim7$,"We report the discovery of a $z\sim7$ group of galaxies that contains two Little Red Dots (LRDs) just 3.3 kpc apart, along with three satellite galaxies, as part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). These LRDs are massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $>1$ mag) whereas the three satellites are lower-mass objects ($M_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show strong evidence for a Balmer Break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free AGN as the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous to interpret, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction may be responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the Epoch of Reionization.","['Rosa M.

The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function,"Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks and PN models to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of the helium content at higher metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are very sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF bright-end cutoff and use it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.","['Lucas M.

X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity: XI. Pipeline-determined Physical Properties of Magellanic Cloud OB Stars,"The proximity & low dust extinction of the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal environment for metal-poor massive stars to be studied in detail. The HST ULLYSES initiative has provided exquisite ultraviolet spectroscopy of a large sample of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, and its legacy value has been enhanced through the acquisition of optical VLT/XShooter spectroscopy (XShootU). We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of 122 LMC & 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are required for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor massive stars. We also aim to identify double-lined binaries and OeBe stars for which analysis requires non-standard treatment. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU spectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC & SMC metallicities. We determine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC & 77 SMC massive stars, ranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB sample (OeBe & candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in agreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses spanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC & 11-74 Msun in the SMC. We determine a revised Teff-spectral type calibration for Magellanic Cloud stars, identify stars with peculiar radial velocities, and compare wind properties of high luminosity O stars with dense winds, revealing ~0.27 dex higher wind momenta of LMC stars with respect to SMC counterparts. Incorporating the recent empirical metallicity dependence of Z^0.22 for wind velocities, this suggests a mass-loss dependence of Z^0.5 for luminous O stars. Studies incorporating ultraviolet mass-loss diagnostics are required for OB stars with weak winds and/or low luminosities.","['J.M. Bestenlehner', 'P.A. Crowther', 'C. Hawcroft', 'H. Sana', 'F.

"CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Pseudo-power spectrum formalism, improved source masking and validation on mocks","Precise, unbiased measurements of extragalactic background anisotropies require careful treatment of systematic effects in fluctuation-based, broad-band intensity mapping measurements. In this paper we detail improvements in methodology for the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER), concentrating on flat field errors and source masking errors. In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudo-power spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and NIR photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over two Vega magnitudes deeper than the completeness limits of 2MASS alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below $<10\%$ at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks. We demonstrate that residual flat field errors comprise $<20\%$ of the final CIBER power spectrum uncertainty with this methodology.","['Richard M. Feder', 'James J.

CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Measurements of near-IR auto- and cross-power spectra on arcminute to sub-degree scales,"We present new anisotropy measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) for angular multipoles $300<\ell<10^5$ using imaging data at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m from the fourth flight of the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER). Using improved analysis methods and higher quality fourth flight data, we detect surface brightness fluctuations on scales $\ell<2000$ with CIBER auto-power spectra at $\sim14\sigma$ and 18$\sigma$ for 1.1 and 1.8 $\mu$m, respectively, and at $\sim10\sigma$ in cross-power spectra. The CIBER measurements pass internal consistency tests and represent a $5-10\times$ improvement in power spectrum sensitivity on several-arcminute scales relative to that of existing studies. Through cross-correlations with tracers of diffuse galactic light (DGL), we determine that scattered DGL contributes $<10\%$ to the observed fluctuation power at high confidence. On scales $\theta > 5'$, the CIBER auto- and cross-power spectra exceed predictions for integrated galactic light (IGL) and integrated stellar light (ISL) by over an order of magnitude, and are inconsistent with our baseline IGL+ISL+DGL model at high significance. We cross-correlate two of the CIBER fields with 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m mosaics from the Spitzer Deep Wide-Field Survey and find similar evidence for departures from Poisson noise in Spitzer-internal power spectra and CIBER $\times$ Spitzer cross-power spectra. A multi-wavelength analysis indicates that the auto-power of the fluctuations at low-$\ell$ is bluer than the Poisson noise from IGL and ISL; however, for $1' <\theta < 10'$, the cross-correlation coefficient $r_{\ell}$ of nearly all band combinations decreases with increasing $\theta$, disfavoring astrophysical explanations that invoke a single correlated sky component.","['Richard M.

Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years,"A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and a control model that assumes the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_V$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the control model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 41 considered $D_V$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 70.5 for the control void-free model, while the void models give only $44.8 - 46.7$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.0\sigma$ without a void to $1.0\sigma - 1.2\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth, but the void-free model provides the worst fit in all cases. Overall, our results suggest that recent hints of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.","['Indranil Banik', 'Vasileios Kalaitzidis']",4.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17934,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],MNRAS in this form,,['cosmological parameters – cosmology: theory – cosmology: observations – distance scale – large-scale structure of Universe – gravitation 1 INTRODUCTION Much of our information about cosmology comes from the cosmic microwavebackground(CMB'],2025-01-31
Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 across a state transition,"We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic observations covering three distinct accretion states of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) MAXI J1820+070: the luminous hard state, a hard-intermediate state and the soft state. Our observations were obtained during the 2018 eruption of MAXI J1820+070 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and AstroSat observatory. The extinction towards the source turns out to be low - $\rm E_{B-V} = 0.2 \pm 0.05$ - making it one of the best UV accretion laboratories among LMXBs. Remarkably, we observe only moderate differences between all three states, with all spectra displaying similar continuum shapes and emission lines. Moreover, the continua are not well-described by physically plausible irradiated disc models. All of this challenges the standard reprocessing picture for UV emission from erupting LMXBs. The UV emission lines are double-peaked, with high-ionization lines displaying higher peak-to-peak velocities. None of the lines display obvious outflow signatures, even though blue-shifted absorption features have been seen in optical and near-infrared lines during the hard state. The emission line ratios are consistent with normal abundances, suggesting that the donor mass at birth was low enough to avoid CNO processing ($\rm M_{2,i} \lesssim 1.0 - 1.5 {\mathrm M_{\odot}}$). Finally, we study the evolution of UV variability in our time-resolved HST observations (hard and hard-intermediate states). All UV power spectra can be modelled with a broken power-law, superposed on which we tentatively detect the $\simeq 18$s quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) that has been seen in other spectral bands.","['Maria Georganti', 'Christian Knigge', 'Noel Castro Segura', 'Knox S.

Aspects of Spatially-Correlated Random Fields: Extreme-Value Statistics and Clustering Properties,"Rare events of large-scale spatially-correlated exponential random fields are studied. The influence of spatial correlations on clustering and non-sphericity is investigated. The size of the performed simulations permits to study beyond-$7.5$-sigma events ($1$ in $10^{13}$). As an application, this allows to resolve individual Hubble patches which fulfill the condition for primordial black hole formation. It is argued that their mass spectrum is drastically altered due to co-collapse of clustered overdensities as well as the mutual threshold-lowering through the latter.

Dust evolution by chemisputtering during protostellar formation,"Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation, particularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The destruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled primarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach could be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We focused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation, specifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also investigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We modeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal equilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each grain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between the grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered three materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a temporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the evolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of the sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of the gas phase. The application of our method to trajectories where the temperature and density of the gas decrease after the sublimation of a portion of the grain distribution highlights the limitations of current vaporization prescriptions in simulations. The dynamical approach leads to more accurate results for the carbon grain quantity when the temperature and density of the gas evolve quickly. The dynamical approach application to collapse and disk evolution is then foreseen with its integration into hydrodynamic simulations.","['Antonin Borderies', 'Benoît Commerçon', 'Bernard Bourdon']",13.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17937,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,"['extinction 1', 'magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – opacity – stars: formation – (ISM:) dust']",2025-01-31
Spatially Resolved Circumgalactic Medium Around a Star-Forming Galaxy Driving a Galactic Outflow at $z\approx 0.8$,"We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity.

Tracing the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone with Sulfur Chemistry,"The circumstellar liquid-water habitable zone guides our search for potentially inhabited exoplanets, but remains observationally untested. We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modelling we find that the observability of sulfur-gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur-gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalise this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur-chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the Habitable Zone in the near-future.","['Sean Jordan', 'Oliver Shorttle', 'Paul B.

NEATH IV: an early onset of complex organic chemistry in molecular clouds,"Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.","['F.

The IACOB project XIV. New clues on the location of the TAMS in the massive star domain,"Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.","['A. de Burgos', 'S.

Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodyanamic characteristics II: reflections on non-reflecting boundary conditions,"We present our implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code LaRe3D. This implementation couples a characteristics-based boundary condition with a Lagrangian remap code, demonstrating the generality and flexibility of such non-reflecting boundary conditions for use with arbitrary grid-based MHD schemes. To test this implementation for perturbations on a background state, we present simulations of a hot sphere in an angled magnetic field. We then examine a series of simulations where we advect a spheromak through a non-reflecting boundary condition at four speeds related to the fast and slow magnetosonic speeds and the Alfven speed. We compare the behavior of these simulations to ground truth simulations run from the same initial condition on an extended grid that keeps the spheromak in the simulation volume at all times. We find that the non-reflecting boundary condition can lead to severe, physical differences developing between a simulation using a non-reflecting boundary and a ground truth simulation using a larger simulation volume. We conclude by discussing the origins of these differences.","['N. Dylan Kee', 'Lucas A. Tarr', 'Peter W. Schuck', 'Mark G. Linton', 'James E.

In this paper, we describe a postprocessing pipeline to identify persistent sources of interference, filter out false positives, and search for signals not immediately identifiable as anthropogenic radio frequency interference during the VLA Sky Survey. As of 01 September 2024, the Commensal Open-source Multi-mode Interferometric Cluster had observed more than 950,000 unique pointings. This paper presents the strategy we employ when commensally observing during the VLA Sky Survey and a postprocessing strategy for the data collected during the survey. To test this postprocessing pipeline, we searched toward 511 stars from the $Gaia$ catalog with coherent beams. This represents about 30 minutes of observation during VLASS, where we typically observe about 2000 sources per hour in the coherent beamforming mode. We did not detect any unidentifiable signals, setting isotropic power limits ranging from 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{16}$W.","['Chenoa D.

Into the Mystic: the MUSE view of the ionized gas in the Mystic Mountains in Carina,"We present optical integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Mystic Mountains, a dust pillar complex in the center of the Carina Nebula that is heavily irradiated by the nearby young massive cluster Trumpler 14. With the continuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the ionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and ionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901, 902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows despite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission tracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in this highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the Mystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and the corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest remaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have been compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star formation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the role that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of embedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding time is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets, making it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent the type of environment where most stars form.","['Megan Reiter', 'Anna F.

Mapping the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario to $f(T)$ modified gravity: Effects on structure growth rate,"The concept of a rapidly sign-switching cosmological constant, interpreted as a mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe and known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, has significantly improved the fit to observational data, offering a promising framework for alleviating major cosmological tensions such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, when considered within general relativity, this scenario does not predict any effects on the evolution of the matter density contrast beyond modifications to the background functions. In this work, we propose a new gravitational model in which the background dynamics predicted by the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework are mapped into $f(T)$ gravity, dubbed $f(T)-\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, rendering the models indistinguishable at the background level. However, in this new scenario, the sign-switching cosmological constant dynamics modify the evolution of linear matter perturbations through an effective gravitational constant, $G_{\rm eff}$. We investigate the evolution of the growth rate and derive new observational constraints for this scenario using RSD measurements. We also present new constraints in the standard $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM case, incorporating the latest Type Ia supernovae data samples available in the literature, along with BAO data from DESI. Our findings indicate that the new corrections expected at the linear perturbative level, as revealed through RSD samples, can provide significant evidence in favor of this new scenario. Additionally, this model may be an excellent candidate for resolving the current $S_8$ tension.","['Mateus S. Souza', 'Ana M. Barcelos', 'Rafael C.

Fractal algorithm for multiple lens analyses,"A microlensing exoplanet search is a unique method for finding planets orbiting distant stars. However, in the past, the method used to analyze microlensing data could not deal with complex lens systems. The number of lenses was limited three or less. Positions calculations of images and integration of them suffered from severe round-off errors because of singularities. We developed a new algorithm to calculate the light curves of multiple lens systems. In this algorithm, fractal-like consecutive self-similar division (SSD) is used to find sparse images. SSD is also useful for integrating images to efficiently obtain magnifications. The new algorithm does not use root finding for the lens equation and is free from caustic singularities. There is no limit on the number of lenses. Compared to inverse-ray shooting, this method dramatically improves the computing time. The calculation can be adjusted to obtain either a high-precision final result or high-speed quick result. Although this new algorithm was developed for a microlensing planet search, its application to quasar microlensing is also expected. This paper discusses problems in the modeling of a multiple lens system and then presents the new algorithm in detail.",['Fumio Abe'],9.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18032,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,['Gravitational lenses — Extra solar planets — Quasars — Numerical method and analysis 1'],2025-01-31
An energetic absorption outflow in QSO J1402+2330: Analysis of DESI observations,"Context. Quasar outflows play a significant role in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, impacting the interstellar medium and potentially influencing galaxy evolution. Characterizing these outflows is essential for understanding AGN-driven processes. Aims. We aim to analyze the physical properties of the mini-broad absorption line outflow in quasar J1402+2330 using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We seek to measure the outflows location, energetics, and potential impact on AGN feedback processes. Methods. In the spectrum of J1402+2330, we identify multiple ionic absorption lines, including ground and excited states. We measure the ionic column densities and then use photoionization models to determine the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter of the outflow. We utilized the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state of N iii and S iv to determine the electron number density. Results. The derived electron number density, combined with the ionization parameter, indicates an outflow distance of approximately 2200 pc from the central source. Having a mass outflow rate of more than one thousand solar masses per year and a kinetic energy output exceeding 5 percent of the Eddington luminosity, this outflow can significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the absorption outflow in J1402+2330 plays a potentially significant role in AGN feedback processes.

X-ray Spectra from General Relativistic RMHD Simulations of Thin Disks,"We compare X-ray emission from several general relativistic, multi-frequency, radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin black hole accretion disks with different accretion rates and spins. The simulations were performed using the M1 closure scheme, resolved with twelve frequency (energy) bins logarithmically spaced from $5 \times 10^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^3$ keV. We apply a general relativistic Monte Carlo transport code to post-process the simulation data with greater fidelity in frequency resolution and Compton scattering treatment. Despite the relatively few energy bins and Kompaneets approximation to Compton scattering utilized in the M1 method, we find generally good agreement between the methods. Both produce prominent thermal profiles with peaks around 2 - 2.5 keV, where agreement is particularly strong and representative of the soft state. Both also find weaker (lower luminosity) thermally sourced emission extending out to 100 keV due to the hotter innermost regions of the disks. Inverse Compton scattering becomes increasingly effective at hardening spectral outputs with increasing black hole spin, and becomes the dominant mechanism for photons that escape with energies between 10 to several hundred keV. At very high rates of spin the radiation flux in this upscattered component becomes comparable to the thermal flux, a phenomenon typically associated with intermediate states. Beyond $10^4$ keV, we observe faint, free-free emission from hot, optically thin coronal regions developing near the horizon, common to both spinning and nonspinning black holes.","['Nathaniel Roth', 'Peter Anninos', 'P.

Neutrinos in IceCube and KM3NeT,"Neutrino observatories such as IceCube, Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), and Super-Kamiokande cover a broad energy range that enables the study of both atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos. IceCube and KM3NeT focus on a similar energy range, from a few GeV to PeV, and have conducted competitive work on the atmospheric neutrino flux, three-flavor oscillation parameter measurements, searches beyond the Standard Model, and investigations of cosmic-ray accelerators using high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. Recent IceCube findings of evidence of neutrino signals from NGC~1068 have triggered a series of follow-up studies. These studies provide evidence that a subset of Seyfert galaxies may produce high-energy neutrinos. The emerging candidates are NGC~4151, NGC~3079, CGCG~420-015, and Circinus Galaxy. Furthermore, a stacking analysis of 13 selected sources in the Southern Hemisphere reported a cumulative neutrino signal at 3.0\,$\sigma$, offering independent evidence that some X-ray-bright Seyfert galaxies could be potential high-energy neutrino sources. KM3NeT, still under construction, continues to accumulate data that will support future studies of astrophysical neutrino sources. However, with its currently deployed detection units, it has detected an ultra-high-energy event of several tens of PeV originating from approximately 1 degree above the horizon. This contribution highlights and summarizes recent findings from IceCube and KM3NeT in both neutrino physics and astrophysics.",['Shiqi Yu'],7.0,6.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18076,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-31
Evolution of X-ray Gas in SN 1987A from 2007 to 2021: Ring Fading and Ejecta Brightening Unveiled through Differential Emission Measure Analysis,"As the nearest supernova (SN) observed since Kepler's SN of 1604, SN 1987A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the early evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs). Despite extensive studies through both observations and simulations, there is still an urgent need for a more effective approach to integrate the results from two sides. In this study, we conducted a detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the XMM-Newton observations taken in 2007 to 2021 to characterize the continuous temperature structure of SN 1987A, which can be better compared with simulations. The X-ray plasma exhibit a temperature distribution with a major peak at $\sim0.5$-$1$ keV and a high-temperature tail extending to $\gtrsim5$ keV. The emission measure (EM) of the major peak started to decline around 2014, while the EM of the tail continued increasing and appears to have formed a secondary peak at $\sim3$-$5$ keV in recent years. Our DEM results consistent well with simulations, which help to further identify the major peak as originating from the equatorial ring and the secondary peak as arising from the newly shocked ejecta. Together with the simulations, our DEM analysis reveals recent fading of the ring and brightening of the ejecta in X-rays from SN 1987A. Additionally, we observed a recent decrease in the centroid energy of Fe K line, providing further evidence of newly shocked ejecta.","['Lei Sun', 'Salvatore Orlando', 'Emanuele Greco', 'Marco Miceli', 'Yang Chen', 'Jacco Vink', 'Ping Zhou']",23.0,36.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18090,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Supernova remnants (1667)'],2025-01-31
Unusual X-ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising From the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium,"Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O VII forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them, it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O VII G-ratio ($\gtrsim1$) and high O VIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ ratio ($\gtrsim0.2$) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton RGS observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by non-equilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O VII resonance line and the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as $\tau_{\rm OVII}\sim0.6$ and $\tau_{\rm OVIII}\sim0.2$. We estimated the temperature as $kT_{\rm e}\sim0.18$ keV and the oxygen column density as $N_{\rm O}\sim0.8\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation {of} the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by $\sim20\%$ compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be $\sim1.2$.","['Lei Sun', 'Salvatore Orlando', 'Emanuele Greco', 'Marco Miceli', 'Yiping Li', 'Yang Chen', 'Jacco Vink', 'Ping Zhou']",6.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18091,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Supernova remnants (1667)'],2025-01-31

Constraints on Baryon Density from the Effective Optical Depth of High-Redshift Quasars,"We present constraints on the baryonic matter density parameter, $\Omega_b$, within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our analysis utilizes observational data on the effective optical depth from high-redshift quasars. To parameterize the photoionization rate $\Gamma_{-12}$, we employ a Bézier polynomial. Additionally, we approximate the Hubble parameter at high redshifts as $H(z)\approx 100h\Omega_m^{1/2} (1+z)^{3/2}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Confidence regions are obtained with $h=0.701\pm0.013$ and $\Omega_m = 0.315$, optimized by the Planck mission. The best-fit values are $\Omega_b =0.043^{+0.005}_{-0.006}$ and $\Omega_b = 0.045^{+0.004}_{-0.006}$, corresponding to an old data set and a new data set, respectively. And we test the non-parametric form of $\Gamma_{-12}$, obtaining $\Omega_b = 0.048^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$. These results are consistent with the findings of Planck at the 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of quasar datasets in constraining $\Omega_b$, eliminating the need for independent photoionization rate data. This approach provides detailed cosmic information about baryon density and the photoionization history of the intergalactic medium.","['Wen-Fei Liu', 'Yuan-Bo Xie', 'Zhi-E Liu', 'Jin Qin', 'Kang Jiao', 'Dong-Yao Zhao', 'Tong-Jie Zhang']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18182,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['with some even approaching the epoch of reionization', 'often at very high redshifts', 'Observational cosmology (1146)', 'Cosmological parame- ters (339)', 'Intergalactic medium (813)', 'Baryon density (139)', 'Quasars (1319) 1 INTRODUCTION Quasars are one of the most distant celestial objects that can be observed as luminous sources']",2025-01-31
On the increase in the concentration of primordial black holes in the halos of dwarf galaxies,"Through numerical experiments, we have predicted that if dark matter (DM) contains even a small fraction, $f_0\sim10^{-4}$, of primordial black holes (PBHs), during the formation of the gravitationally bound halo of a dwarf galaxy, these PBHs will concentrate in a region with a radius of about 10 pc, so that their local fraction will exceed 1%. Unlike previous studies of PBH migration to the centers of galaxies, the numerical experiments conducted here take into account the early formation of a massive ""dress"" of DM around the PBHs and the non-stationarity of the halo during its formation. Applying our results to models of heating stellar clusters in the Eridanus II and Segue I galaxies due to dynamical friction between stars and PBHs allows us to impose constraints on the abundance of PBHs that are two orders of magnitude stricter than previously thought.","['S.

Evolution of molecular clouds on galaxy-cloud scale revealed by gravitational network analysis : High-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion or merging,"Observations show that molecular gas in spiral galaxies is organized into a network of interconnected systems through the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. Building on this picture, we model molecular gas in the galaxy NGC 628 as a gravitational network, where molecular clouds are represented as nodes. Through analyzing this network, we can characterize both the gravitational interactions and the physical properties of the clouds using geometry-based network metrics. A strong correlation is observed between the geometric and physical properties of the nodes (clouds). High-mass clouds tend to exhibit less clustering and greater average separations, suggesting that they generally have fewer neighbors. During their formation and evolution, high-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion or merging, leading to more isolated characteristics within the network. This aligns with observations showing a decrease in the virial ratio of molecular clouds as their mass increases. For clouds at different evolutionary stages, less evolved clouds with lower mass are typically found in tighter gravitational subnetworks, with closer proximity to neighboring clouds. As a result, they are more prone to accretion or merging during evolution.","['J. W.

An examination of large-scale galactic effects on molecular cloud properties in NGC 628 : The significant impact of tidal effects from neighboring material on the evolution of molecular clouds,"The physical factors that influence the development of molecular cloud's density contrast are connected to those that affect star formation in the galaxy. For NGC 628 (M74), the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds initially increases with the distance to the galactic center ($R_{G}$) and then keeps relatively stable. Spiral arms, bubbles and magnetic fields are not responsible for the variations in density contrast observed among molecular clouds. The effects of shear and tides calculated from the galactic rotation curve consistently decrease as $R_{G}$ increases, and the shear effect can be neglected. We further studied the tidal effects of the neighboring material on each cloud using the tidal tensor analysis and the pixel-by-pixel computation, after combining molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar mass surface density maps. When $R_{\rm G} <$ 4 kpc, the tidal strengths derived from the pixel-by-pixel computation decrease as $R_{\rm G}$ increases, and then remains relatively constant when $R_{\rm G} >$ 4 kpc. This aligns well with the dependence of the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds on $R_{\rm G}$. Therefore, the tidal effects of neighboring material have a significant impact on the development of molecular cloud's density contrast. A key factor contributing to the low star formation rate in the galactic center is the excessive tidal influences from neighboring material on molecular clouds, which hinder the gravitational collapse within these clouds, resulting in low density contrasts. The tidal effects from neighboring material may also be a significant contributing factor to the slowing down of a pure free-fall gravitational collapse for gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales revealed in our previous works by velocity gradient measurements.","['J.

Variations of absolute source positions determined from quad-band VLBI observations,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) observed with the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are used as fiducial references on the sky to precisely measure the shape and orientation of the Earth. Their positions form a celestial reference frame that plays an important role in both astronomy and geodesy. This study investigates the accuracy and stability of the positions of the AGNs that are measured by simultaneous VLBI observations at 3.3, 5.5, 6.6, and 10.5 GHz. Based on position time series from dedicated geodetic solutions, we characterize the observed source position variations and identify the possible factors causing such variations. We find that the primary contributor is source structure for sources above 20-degree declination while the sensitivity of the observations to the declination coordinate predominates for sources below 20-degree declination. The position time series are further explored to derive more realistic uncertainties for the quad-band positions. Significant position offsets with respect to the positions at 2.2/8.6 GHz are found for 15% of the sources. For 6% of the sources, the offsets are larger than 0.8 milli-arcseconds. Source structure may be divided into two parts: the invisible structure (within the beam size) and the visible structure (on larger scales). The latter causes closure delays enlarging post-fit delay residuals in geodetic solutions whereas the former causes source position changes. Such position changes will contribute significantly to the offsets between radio and optical positions. Overall, this work highlights the necessity to have a specific quad-band catalog for processing operational quad-band observations.","['Ming Hui Xu', 'Patrick Charlot']",12.0,23.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18276,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['celestial reference frame – AGNs – VLBI – VGOS – source structure 1'],2025-01-31
Interpretability of deep-learning methods applied to large-scale structure surveys,"Deep learning and convolutional neural networks in particular are powerful and promising tools for cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys. They are already providing similar performance to classical analysis methods using fixed summary statistics, are showing potential to break key degeneracies by better probe combination and will likely improve rapidly in the coming years as progress is made in the physical modelling through both software and hardware improvement. One key issue remains: unlike classical analysis, a convolutional neural network's decision process is hidden from the user as the network optimises millions of parameters with no direct physical meaning. This prevents a clear understanding of the potential limitations and biases of the analysis, making it hard to rely on as a main analysis method. In this work, we explore the behaviour of such a convolutional neural network through a novel method. Instead of trying to analyse a network a posteriori, i.e. after training has been completed, we study the impact on the constraining power of training the network and predicting parameters with degraded data where we removed part of the information. This allows us to gain an understanding of which parts and features of a large-scale structure survey are most important in the network's prediction process. We find that the network's prediction process relies on a mix of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian information, and seems to put an emphasis on structures whose scales are at the limit between linear and non-linear regimes.","['Gaspard Aymerich', 'Tomasz Kacprzak', 'Alexandre Refregier']",13.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18333,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-31

We show that the presence of a {\it Negative Cosmological Constant} ($\Lambda < 0$, nCC) together with an evolving part (modelled by the CPL parametrisation) in DE sector allows a {\it non-phantom} region for the DE in the constrained parameter space consistent with different observational data. This essentially solves the problem of {\it phantom} behaviour in the DE sector which is difficult to obtain through reasonable field theory. The implications nCC in the DE sector for different cosmological tensions are also studied.

Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark energy from latest cosmological observations,"In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.","['Yuhang Yang', 'Qingqing Wang', 'Chunyu Li', 'Peibo Yuan', 'Xin Ren', 'Emmanuel N.

Subtle and Spectacular: Diverse White Dwarf Debris Disks Revealed by JWST,"This letter reports 12 novel spectroscopic detections of warm circumstellar dust orbiting polluted white dwarfs using JWST MIRI. The disks span two orders of magnitude in fractional infrared brightness and more than double the number of white dwarf dust spectra available for mineralogical study. Among the highlights are: i) the two most subtle infrared excesses yet detected, ii) the strongest silicate emission features known for any debris disk orbiting any main-sequence or white dwarf star, iii) one disk with a thermal continuum but no silicate emission, and iv) three sources with likely spectral signatures of silica glass. The near ubiquity of solid-state emission requires small dust grains that are optically thin, and thus must be replenished on year-to-decade timescales by ongoing collisions. The disk exhibiting a featureless continuum can only be fit by dust temperatures in excess of 2000K, implying highly refractory material comprised of large particles, or non-silicate mineral species. If confirmed, the glassy silica orbiting three stars could be indicative of high-temperature processes and subsequent rapid cooling, such as occur in high-velocity impacts or vulcanism. These detections have been enabled by the unprecedented sensitivity of MIRI LRS spectroscopy and highlight the capability and potential for further observations in future cycles.","['J.

For the different elements, our results for the total rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 10^{-13}-10^{-9} cm^3/s, 10^{-12}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, and 10^{-13}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. We also provide fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections of the various ions, finding larger and more slowly declining values with energy in comparison to the hydrogenic approximation. Using this new atomic data, we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 \mum) and optical (e.g. [Rb I] 7802, 7949 A) lines disappear in the new model. Instead a strong [Se I] line is seen to be emerging at \lambda=5.03 \mum. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.","['Smaranika Banerjee', 'Anders Jerkstrand', 'Nigel Badnell', 'Quentin Pognan', 'Niamh Ferguson', 'Jon Grumor']",12.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18345,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Atomic Physics'],ApJ,,"['kilonova', 'Neutron star', 'spectra', 'atomic calculation', 'radiative transfer 1']",2025-01-31
Unveiling the origin of XMM-Newton soft proton flares II. Systematics in the proton spectral analysis,"Low-energy protons entering the field of view of the XMM-Newton telescope scatter with the X-ray mirror surface and might reach the X-ray detectors on the focal plane. They manifest in the form of a sudden increase in the rates, usually referred to as soft proton flares. By knowing the conversion factor between the soft proton energy and the deposited charge on the detector, it is possible to derive the incoming flux and to study the environment of the Earth magnetosphere at different distances. We present the results of testing these matrices with real data for the first time, while also exploring the seasonal and solar activity effect on the proton environment. The selected spectra are relative to 55 simultaneous MOS and PN observations with flares raised in four different temporal windows: December-January and July-August of 2001-2002 (solar maximum) and 2019-2020 (solar minimum). The main result of the spectral analysis is that the physical model representative of the proton spectra at the input of the telescope is a power law. However, a second and phenomenological component is necessary to take into account imprecision in the generation of the matrices at softer energies.","['T. Mineo', 'V. Fioretti', 'S. Lotti', 'S.

"Characterising the multiple protostellar system VLA 1623-2417 with JWST, ALMA and VLA: outflow origins, dust growth and an unsettled disk","Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (>1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~<15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~<22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.","['Isaac C.

Gravitational waves from metastable cosmic strings in the delayed scaling scenario,"Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). While such signals could be explained by gravitational waves from a network of metastable cosmic strings (CSs), standard scenarios involving the Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant challenges. Specifically, these scenarios predict a GWB spectrum inconsistent with the non-detection at higher frequencies by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) for CSs with relatively large string tension. It is also difficult to prevent the monopole forming phase transition just before the CS forming symmetry breaking, which spoils the CS network formation. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario, where the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during inflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from metastable CSs in the delayed scaling scenario, consistent with the PTA observations while satisfying the LVK constraints. Furthermore, we explore its potential signatures at frequencies accessible to other detectors such as LVK as well as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin or DECIGO and BBO. We also discuss the implications on inflation and underlying UV theories, such as the grand unified theories.","['Yifan Hu', 'Kohei Kamada']",3.0,21.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18380,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-31
Strong clumping in global streaming instability simulations with a dusty fluid,"Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.","['Dominik Ostertag', 'Mario Flock']",6.0,7.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18424,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-31

Dissociative recombination of N$_2$H$^+$: Isotopic effects,"The investigation of the isotopic ratio of interstellar nitrogen -- $^{14}$N versus $^{15}$N -- is done, for explaining its variations observed for N2H+ in different interstellar and Solar environments. The goal is to produce cross sections and rate coefficients for electron impact dissociative recombination for different isotopologues of N$_2$H$^+$, since it was envisioned as a novel source that can lead to nitrogen fractionation. We calculate dissociative recombination cross sections and rate coefficients using the normal mode approximation combined with the R-matrix theory and vibronic frame transformation within the multichannel quantum defect theory for eight isotopologues containing both $^{14}$N, $^{15}$N and H, D. Our calculations show that the relative differences respective to the main isotopologue ($^{14}$N$_2$H$^+$) is below 1% for the hydrogen containing isotopologues, but reaches almost 30% for the heaviest deuterated isotopologue, leading us to the conclusion that according to the present status of the theory, dissociative recombination is not responsible for the peculiar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratios of N$_2$H$^+$ observed in the different interstellar molecular clouds.","['J.

Three fast-rotating Jovian Trojans identified by TESS set new population density limits,"Here we report on the identification of the three fastest rotating Jovian Trojans with reliable population assignment, using light curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey mission, also confirmed by Zwicky Transient Facility data. For two of our targets the rotation periods are moderately below the previously accepted ~5 h Jovian Trojan breakup limit (4.26 and 4.75 h), however, the rotation period of (13383) was found to be P = 2.926 h, leading to a density estimate of $\rho$ $\approx$ 1.6 $g cm^{-3}$, higher than the generally accepted $\leq$ 1 $g cm^{-3}$ density limit of Jovian Trojans. If associated with lower densities, this rotation rate requires considerable cohesion in the order of a few kPa. The relatively high albedo (pV $\approx$ 0.11) and fast rotation suggest that (13383) may have undergone an energetic collision that spun up the body and exposed bright material to the surface.","['Csaba Kiss', 'Nóra Takács', 'Csilla E.

A Comprehensive Reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec Transmission Spectrum,"Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in our galaxy. Interior structure models suggest that the coldest sub-Neptunes could host liquid water oceans underneath their hydrogen envelopes - sometimes called 'hycean' planets. JWST transmission spectra of the $\sim$ 250 K sub-Neptune K2-18 b were recently used to report detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, alongside weaker evidence of (CH$_3$)$_2$S (dimethyl sulfide, or DMS). Atmospheric CO$_2$ was interpreted as evidence for a liquid water ocean, while DMS was highlighted as a potential biomarker. However, these notable claims were derived using a single data reduction and retrieval modeling framework, which did not allow for standard robustness tests. Here we present a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra, including the first analysis of the second-order NIRISS SOSS data. We incorporate multiple well-tested data reduction pipelines and retrieval codes, spanning 60 different data treatments and over 250 atmospheric retrievals. We confirm the detection of CH$_4$ ($\approx$ 4$\sigma$), with a volume mixing ratio of log CH$_4$ = $-1.15^{+0.40}_{-0.52}$, but we find no statistically significant or reliable evidence for CO$_2$ or DMS. Finally, we quantify the observed atmospheric composition using photochemical-climate and interior models, demonstrating that our revised composition of K2-18 b can be explained by an oxygen-poor mini-Neptune without requiring a liquid water surface or life.","['Stephen P.

The Southern Photometrical Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS): searching for metal-poor dwarf galaxies,"The metal content of a galaxy's interstellar medium reflects the interplay between different evolutionary processes such as feedback from massive stars and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. Despite the expected abundance of low-luminosity galaxies, the low-mass and low-metallicity regime remains relatively understudied. Since the properties of their interstellar medium resemble those of early galaxies, identifying such objects in the Local Universe is crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy evolution. We used the DR3 catalog of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) to select low-metallicity dwarf galaxy candidates based on color selection criteria typical of metal-poor, star-forming, low-mass systems. The final sample contains approximately 50 candidates. Spectral energy distribution fitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\sim$ 90\% of the candidates are best fit by models with very low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot sample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find oxygen abundances in the range $7.35<$ 12 + log(O/H) $< 7.93$ (5\% to 17\% of the solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers in the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content relative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical morphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These results suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an external event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the oxygen abundance in these systems.","['M.

Universal description of the Neutron Star's surface and its key global properties: A Machine Learning Approach for nonrotating and rapidly rotating stellar models,"Neutron stars provide an ideal theoretical framework for exploring fundamental physics when nuclear matter surpasses densities encountered within atomic nuclei. Despite their paramount importance, uncertainties in the equation of state (EoS) have shrouded their internal structure. For rotating neutron stars, the shape of their surface is contingent upon the EoS and the rotational dynamics. This work proposes new universal relations regarding the star's surface, employing machine-learning techniques for regression. More specifically, we developed highly accurate universal relations for a neutron star's eccentricity, the star's ratio of the polar to the equatorial radius, and the effective gravitational acceleration at both the pole and the equator. Furthermore, we propose an accurate theoretical formula for $(d\log R(\mu)/d\theta)_{\max}$. This research addresses key astronomical aspects by utilizing these global parameters as features for the training phase of a neural network. Along the way, we introduce new effective parameterizations for each star's global surface characteristics. Our regression methodology enables accurate estimations of the star's surface $R(\mu)$, its corresponding logarithmic derivative $d\log R(\mu)/d\theta$, and its effective acceleration due to gravity $g(\mu)$ with accuracy better than $1 \%$. The analysis is performed for an extended sample of rotating configurations constructed using a large ensemble of 70 tabulated hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models that obey the current multimessenger constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Above all, the suggested relations could provide an accurate framework for the star's surface estimation using data acquired from the NICER X-ray telescope or future missions, and constrain the EoS of nuclear matter when measurements of the relevant observables become available.","['Grigorios Papigkiotis', 'Georgios Vardakas', 'Aristidis Likas', 'Nikolaos Stergioulas']",36.0,47.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18544,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-31
Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE,"We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z > 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.","['Arghyadeep Basu', 'Aniket Bhagwat', 'Benedetta Ciardi', 'Tiago Costa']",13.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18559,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['our understanding of the early galaxy formation process has been challenged', 'galaxies:formation–galaxies:luminosityfunction', 'massfunction–galaxies:starformation–galaxies:high-redshift 1 INTRODUCTION Since the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) started to provide revolutionary data in July 2022']",2025-01-31
Boosting galaxy clustering analyses with non-perturbative modelling of redshift-space distortions,"Redshift-space distortions (RSD), caused by the peculiar velocities of galaxies, are a key modelling challenge in galaxy clustering analyses, limiting the scales from which cosmological information can be reliably extracted. Unlike dynamical or galaxy bias effects, RSD imprint features that are sensitive to non-linearities across all scales. Yet, no distinction between these effects is made by the state-of-the-art analytical approach - the effective field theory (EFT) - which applies the same perturbative expansion to each of them. This paper explores an alternative approach, where the non-perturbative nature of RSD is partially preserved, and compares its effectiveness against the EFT in analysing power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles from synthetic samples of luminous red galaxies, using the projected sensitivity of a Stage-IV galaxy survey. Our results demonstrate that this distinct treatment of RSD improves the robustness of model predictions for both statistics, extending the validity range of the EFT from approximately $0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $0.35\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the one-loop power spectrum and from $0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $0.14\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the tree-level bispectrum. This leads to a significant enhancement in the precision of cosmological parameter constraints, with uncertainties on the Hubble rate, matter density, and scalar amplitude of fluctuations reduced by $20$-$40\,\%$ for the power spectrum multipoles alone compared to the EFT, and by $25$-$50\,\%$ for joint analyses with the bispectrum. The RSD treatment proposed here may thus play a crucial role in maximising the scientific return of current and future galaxy surveys. To support this advancement, all models for the power spectrum and bispectrum used in this work are made available through an extended version of the Python package COMET.","['Alexander Eggemeier', 'Nanoom Lee', 'Román Scoccimarro', 'Benjamin Camacho-Quevedo', 'Andrea Pezzotta', 'Martin Crocce', 'Ariel G.

And if Vulcan was a primordial black hole of planetary-mass ?,"In this work, I re-examine the question of a possible explanation for the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion by the existence of a hypothetical planet, Vulcan, which I consider to be a kind of primordial black hole of planetary-mass. The detection of this kind of celestial body has become possible with modern experimental techniques, inter alia, such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Recently, an excess of ultra-short microlensing events with crossing times of 0.1 to 0.3 days has been reported, suggesting the possible existence of sub-Earth-mass primordial black holes in our solar system. The primordial black hole Vulcan planetary mass hypothesis could then explain the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion under the influence of its gravitational attraction, still remaining hidden from astronomers' telescopes. But in this case, it will also influence the perihelion advance of the other planets. To this end, I first calculate the mutual partial contributions to the perihelion motion of all the planets by two different methods without Vulcan in a model of simplified solar system consisting of the Sun and eight planets. Next, I include Vulcan in this model within the framework of the Newtonian theory of classical gravitation and analyze Vulcan's influence on the perihelion advance of the inner planets, using Vulcan parameters from my previous work. These results are compared with the perihelion advances of the inner planets predicted by the theory of general relativity, and with the data obtained by modern observations.",['S.P.

Magnetic field evolution of X-ray emitting radio-quiet pulsars,"The intense magnetic fields present in neutron stars are closely linked to their observed temperature and spectral characteristics, timing properties, including spin period and its derivatives. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic field evolution is essential for understanding how the strength of the magnetic field change over time. The decay rate of magnetic field in isolated, non-accreting neutron stars can be assessed by evaluating the second derivative of the spin frequency. Another method to estimate this rate involves monitoring an increase in thermal emission beyond what is expected from standard cooling processes, assuming no additional heating mechanisms are present. Our findings indicate that for X-ray emitting isolated neutron stars, the evolution rate of spin period derivative aligns with the dissipation rate of magnetic energy from the dipolar field, provided that a substantial portion of the released energy is emitted as X-rays. The time scale of magnetic field decay is found to be much shorter than typical age of radio pulsars.","['Debasis Atta', 'Vinay Singh', 'D. N.

Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations,"The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.","['Bao-Jun Cai', 'Bao-An Li']",124.0,172.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18676,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'Nuclear Experiment', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,"['Strong-field Gravity', 'Upper/Lower Bounds 1arXiv:2501', 'Nuclear Symmetry Energy', 'Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff Equations', 'Ratio of Pressure over Energy Density', 'Newtonian Limit', 'Supra-dense Matter', 'Peaked Structure', 'Neutron Star', 'Equation of State', 'Speed of Sound', 'pQCD Conformal Limit', 'Dimensionless Trace Anomaly', 'Compactness', 'Causality Boundary', 'Mass-radius Relation', 'Principle of Causality', 'Stiffness', 'Self-gravitating', 'Polytropic Index', 'Maximum-mass Configuration']",2025-02-03
CRexit: how different cosmic ray transport modes affect thermal instability in the circumgalactic medium,"The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical role in galaxy evolution, influencing gas flows, feedback processes, and galactic dynamics. Observations show a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving its formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of non-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas dynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the hot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) simulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on cold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure significantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering the CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs escape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields, diminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold CGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a critical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined within cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their pressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as realized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing their stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide dynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{30}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated atmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects, we demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously large clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly long CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support.","['Matthias Weber', 'Timon Thomas', 'Christoph Pfrommer', 'Ruediger Pakmor']",17.0,20.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18678,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Galaxies: halos – cosmic rays – Magnetohydrodynamics – Methods: numerical 1'],2025-02-03
Evidence for a volcanic atmosphere on the sub-Earth L98-59b,"Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science. High-energy activity from M-dwarfs can destroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could explain the lack of atmosphere detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a mechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally-heated rocky planets. L 98-59 b, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most promising exoplanet to detect a volcanic atmosphere. We present the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 b from four transits observed with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Although the airless model provides an adequate fit to the data based on its $\chi^2$, an SO$_2$ atmosphere is preferred by 3.6$\sigma$ over a flat line in terms of the Bayesian evidence. Such an atmosphere would likely be in a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L 98-59 b must experience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit mass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict the existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L 98-59 b extending up to $R_p\sim 60-90\%$. An SO$_2$-rich volcanic atmosphere on L 98-59 b would be indicative of an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of $f\rm{O}_2>IW+2.7$, and it would imply that L 98-59 b must have retained some of its volatile endowment despite its proximity to its star. Our findings suggest that volcanism may revive secondary atmospheres on tidally heated rocky planets around M-dwarfs.","['Aaron Bello-Arufe', 'Mario Damiano', 'Katherine A.

Anisotropies in the Circumgalactic Medium of Disk Galaxies: Milky Way-like Bubbles or Star Formation-driven Outflows?,"Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.","['Andrea Sacchi', 'Akos Bogdan', 'Nhut Truong']",6.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18681,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['galaxy nuclei – circumgalactic medium – high energy astrophysics – X-ray astronomy 1'],2025-02-03
Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA,"The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, BBHs with $\rm SNR\gtrsim 20$ can be confidently localized to specific GCs within the Milky Way, with an angular resolution of $\sim 10-100$ arc minutes. The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.","['Zeyuan Xuan', 'Kyle Kremer', 'Smadar Naoz']",5.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18682,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['gravitational waves – detection 1'],2025-02-03
"The BTSbot-nearby discovery of SN 2024jlf: rapid, autonomous follow-up probes interaction in an 18.5 Mpc Type IIP supernova","We present observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2024jlf, including spectroscopy beginning just 0.7 days ($\sim$17 hours) after first light. Rapid follow-up was enabled by the new $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ program, which involves autonomously triggering target-of-opportunity requests for new transients in Zwicky Transient Facility data that are coincident with nearby ($D<60$ Mpc) galaxies and identified by the $\texttt{BTSbot}$ machine learning model. Early photometry and non-detections shortly prior to first light show that SN 2024jlf initially brightened by $>$4 mag/day, quicker than $\sim$90% of Type II SNe. Early spectra reveal weak flash ionization features: narrow, short-lived ($1.3 < \tau ~\mathrm{[d]} < 1.8$) emission lines of H$\alpha$, He II, and C IV. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w=50$ km s$^{-1}$, these properties indicate that the red supergiant progenitor exhibited enhanced mass-loss in the last year before explosion. We constrain the mass-loss rate to $10^{-4} < \dot{M}~\mathrm{[M_\odot~yr^{-1}]} < 10^{-3}$ by matching observations to model grids from two independent radiative hydrodynamics codes. $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ automation minimizes spectroscopic follow-up latency, enabling the observation of ephemeral early-time phenomena exhibited by transients.","['Nabeel Rehemtulla', 'W.

"Star Formation Rates, Metallicities, and Stellar Masses on kpc-scales in TNG50","Integral field units (IFU) have extended our knowledge of galactic properties to kpc (or, sometimes, even smaller) patches of galaxies. These scales are where the physics driving galaxy evolution (feedback, chemical enrichment, etc.) take place. Quantifying the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies, both observationally and theoretically, is therefore critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we investigate spatially-resolved scaling relations within central galaxies ($M_\star>10^{9.0}$) at $z=0$ in IllustrisTNG. We examine both the resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS) and the resolved mass-metallicity relation (rMZR) using $1~{\rm kpc}\times1~{\rm kpc}$ maps of galaxies. We find that the rSFMS in IllustrisTNG is well-described by a power-law, but has some dependence on the host galaxy's mass. Conversely, the rMZR for IllustrisTNG can be described by a single power-law at low stellar mass surface density that flattens at high surface densities and is independent of host galaxy mass. We find quantitative agreement in both the rSFMS and rMZR with recent IFU observational campaigns. Furthermore, we argue that the rSFMS is an indirect result of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law and local gas fraction relation, which are both independent of host galaxy properties. Finally, we expand upon a localized leaky-box model to study the evolution of idealized spaxels and find that it provides a good description of these resolved relations. The degree of agreement, however, between idealized spaxels and simulated spaxels depends on the `net' outflow rate for the spaxel, and the observed scaling relations indicate a preference for a low net outflow rate.","['Jia Qi', 'Alex M.

The initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae,"The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era for the study of compact objects. Upcoming detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to add thousands of binary coalescences to the list. However, from a theoretical perspective, our understanding of compact objects is hindered by many uncertainties, and a comprehensive study of the nature of stellar remnants from core-collapse supernovae is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties of stellar remnants using a homogeneous grid of rotating and non-rotating massive stars at various metallicities from Limongi and Chieffi 2018. We simulate the supernova explosion of the evolved progenitors using the HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION (HYPERION) code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020), assuming a thermal bomb model calibrated to match the main properties of SN1987A. We find that the heaviest black hole that can form depends on the initial stellar rotation, metallicity, and the assumed criterion for the onset of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. Non-rotating progenitors at $\big[\rm Fe/H \big]=-3$ can form black holes up to $\sim 87 M_\odot$, falling within the theorized pair-instability mass gap. Conversely, enhanced wind mass loss prevents the formation of BHs more massive than $\sim 41.6 M_\odot$ from rotating progenitors. We use our results to study the black hole mass distribution from a population of $10^6$ isolated massive stars following a Kroupa initial mass function. Finally, we provide fitting formulas to compute the mass of compact remnants as a function of stellar progenitor properties. Our up-to-date prescriptions can be easily implemented in rapid population synthesis codes.","['C. Ugolini', 'M.Limongi', 'R. Schneider', 'A. Chieffi', 'U. N. Di Carlo', 'M.

The outflow impacts on the size of the narrow-line region among type-2 AGNs,"We present the study of the gas kinematics in narrow-line regions (NLRs) of 2,009 type-2 AGNs at $z<0.34$. We construct the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission-line images using publicly available broadband images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The [O III] emission area of the samples, measured down to $1.7\times10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$, ranges from 3.7 kpc$^2$ up to 224 kpc$^2$. With our broadband technique, we found the strong correlation between [O III] area and AGN luminosity inferred from the [O III] luminosity and the mid-infrared luminosity at the rest-frame $15\mu$m. The isophotal threshold used to determine the [O III] area affects the correlation strength in that the brighter isophote yields the stronger correlation between the [O III] area and AGN luminosity. The presence of gas outflow is examined by the ratio of the [O III] velocity dispersion to the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [O\,III]}/\sigma_\star > 1.4$) using the SDSS spectra. At the given luminosity, the objects with and without outflows exhibit the same extension of the [O III] emission. Their correlation between the [O III] area and luminosity is almost identical. It is suggested that the size of NLRs is not affected by outflow mechanisms but rather by photoionization from the central AGNS.","['Kantapon Jensangjun', 'Suraphong Yuma']",12.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18692,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['Galaxy evolution (594)', 'Galaxy quenching (2040)', 'Galaxy kinematics (602) 1', 'Active galactic nuclei (16)', 'AGN host galaxies (2017)']",2025-02-03
Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure,"Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.","['Thomas W.

Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium,"Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.","['Philip F. Hopkins', 'Eliot Quataert', 'Sam B.

"Updated Mass, Eccentricity, and Tidal Heating Constraints for the Earth-sized Planet LP 791-18 d","LP 791-18 d is a temperate Earth-sized planet orbiting a late M dwarf, surrounded by an interior super-Earth (LP 791-18 b, $R_P$ = 1.2 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=0.95$ days) and an exterior sub-Neptune (LP 791-18 c, $R_P$ = 2.5 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=4.99$ days). Dynamical interactions between LP 791-18 d and c produce transit timing variations (TTVs) that can be used to constrain the planet masses and eccentricities. These interactions can also force a non-zero eccentricity for LP 791-18 d, which raises its internal temperature through tidal heating and could drive volcanic outgassing. We present three new transit observations of LP 791-18 c with Palomar/WIRC, including the most precise TTV measurements ($<$ 6 seconds) of this planet to date. We fit these times with a TTV model to obtain updated constraints on the mass, eccentricity, and tidal heat flux of LP 791-18 d. We reduce the mass uncertainty by more than a factor of two ($M_d$ = 0.91 $\pm$ 0.19 $M_{\oplus}$). We perform an updated fit assuming tidally damped free eccentricities and find $e_d = 0.0011^{+0.0010}_{-0.0008}$ and $e_c = 0.0001 \pm 0.0001$, consistent with circular orbits. We find that the observed TTVs are not sensitive to $e \leq$ $\sim$0.01. Without a tidally damped eccentricity prior, $e_d = 0.056^{+0.015}_{-0.014}$, much higher than the eccentricity predicted by n-body simulations incorporating the effects of dynamical excitation and tidal damping. We predict the timing of upcoming JWST secondary eclipse observations for LP 791-18 d, which could tightly constrain the eccentricity and tidal quality factor of this Earth-sized exoplanet.","['Michael Greklek-McKeon', 'Heather A.

Mass flows in the Galactic Center by supernovae of the circumnuclear disk,"Context. The circumnuclear disk (CND) is presently the main supply of mass for the accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). While the accretion is relatively slow, it has been suspected that local episodic explosive events play an important role in the temporary mass inflow toward the SMBH, while also affecting the evolution of the CND. Aims. The aim of this study is to follow the changes in mass flows caused by supernova (SN) explosions nestled in or near the CND. Methods. We perform simulations with the grid-based MHD code FLASH of the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way GC, including gravitational potential, rotation, magnetic field, central wind source, and the warm gas of the CND, all mimicking the observed physical properties. Results. Assuming a M$_\mathrm{SN}=10$ M$_\odot$ as the mass of the precursor of the core-collapse SN event at various locations within 2 pc from the GC, we detect a temporary increase in the accretion rate, transferring an additional 2-60 M$_\odot$ of warm gas to the immediate vicinity of the SMBH, depending on the explosion site. At the same time, the kinetic energy of the SN blows away even mass from the CND; the additional warm gas leaving the simulation domain after the explosion is on the order of $\sim100$ M$_\odot$. In the studied cases, the impact on mass flows and the turbulence caused by the explosion cease after $\sim250$ kyr.","['Barnabas Barna', 'Richard Wünsch', 'Jan Palous', 'Mark R.

Tidal disruption events as origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles,"Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80°-85°in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We want to investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble blown out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them to observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent to the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.","['Tassilo Scheffler', 'Michael M.

Kepler meets Gaia DR3: homogeneous extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram and binary classification,"The original Kepler mission has delivered unprecedented high-quality photometry. These data have impacted numerous research fields (e.g., asteroseismology and exoplanets), and continue to be an astrophysical goldmine. Because of this, thorough investigations of the ~ 200,000 stars observed by Kepler remain of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art characterization of the Kepler targets based on Gaia DR3 data. We place the stars on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), account for the effects of interstellar extinction, and classify targets into several CMD categories (dwarfs, subgiants, red giants, photometric binaries, and others). Additionally, we report various categories of candidate binary systems spanning a range of detection methods, such as Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), radial velocity variables, Gaia non-single stars (NSS), Kepler and Gaia eclipsing binaries from the literature, among others. First and foremost, our work can assist in the selection of stellar and exoplanet host samples regarding CMD and binary populations. We further complement our catalog by quantifying the impact that astrometric differences between Gaia data releases have on CMD location, assessing the contamination in asteroseismic targets with properties at odds with Gaia, and identifying stars flagged as photometrically variable by Gaia.

A confirmed recoiling supermassive black hole in a powerful quasar,"Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present decisive spectroscopic evidence that the gas bound to the SMBH in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 is blue-shifted relative to the host galaxy. This is exclusively explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.","['Marco Chiaberge', 'Takahiro Morishita', 'Matteo Boschini', 'Stefano Bianchi', 'Alessandro Capetti', 'Gianluca Castignani', 'Davide Gerosa', 'Masahiro Konishi', 'Shuhei Koyama', 'Kosuke Kushibiki', 'Erini Lambrides', 'Eileen T.

A Novel Method to Estimate the FUV Flux and a Catalogue for Star-Hosting Discs in Nearby Star-Forming Regions,"Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at >10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.","['Rossella Anania', 'Andrew J.

Chandra Follow-up Observations of Swift-BAT-selected AGNs III,"The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump ($\sim30$ keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick AGN ($N_{\rm H,l.o.s}>1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local ($z<0.05$) Compton-thick (CT) AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1-2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources also were observed with XMM-Newton allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$.

Carbon Stars From Gaia DR3 and the Space Density of Dwarf Carbon Stars,"Carbon stars (with atmospheric C/O$>1$) range widely in temperature and luminosity, from low mass dwarfs to asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). The main sequence dwarf carbon (dC) stars have inherited carbon-rich material from an AGB companion, which has since transitioned to a white dwarf. The dC stars are far more common than C giants, but no reliable estimates of dC space density have been published to date. We present results from an all-sky survey for carbon stars using the low-resolution XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We developed and measured a set of spectral indices contrasting C$_{\rm 2}$ and CN molecular band strengths in carbon stars against common absorption features found in normal (C/O$<1$) stars such as CaI, TiO and Balmer lines. We combined these indices with the XP spectral coefficients as input to supervised machine-learning algorithms trained on a vetted sample of known C stars from LAMOST. We describe the selection of the carbon candidate sample, and provide a catalog of 43,574 candidates dominated by cool C giants in the Magellanic Clouds and at low galactic latitude in the Milky Way. We report the confirmation of candidate C stars using intermediate ($R\sim 1800$) resolution optical spectroscopy from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, and provide estimates of sample purity and completeness. From a carefully-vetted sample of over 600 dCs, we measure their local space density to be $\rho_0\,=\,1.96^{+0.14}_{-0.12}\times10^{-6}\,\text{pc}^{-3}$ (about one dC in every local disk volume of radius 50\,pc), with a relatively large disk scale height of $H_z\,=\,856^{+49}_{-43}\,$pc.","['Benjamin R.

Spectral Insights and Evolutionary Pathways of Globular Cluster ULX in NGC 1399: A Two-Decade X-ray and Optical Study,"We present new multi-wavelength observations of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) hosted by globular clusters (GCs) in the giant elliptical NGC 1399, focusing on CXO J0338318-352604 (GCU7), only the second GC ULX known to have luminous optical emission lines. Notably, only NII and OIII emission is observed in the optical spectra, suggesting H-poor material. Previous work suggested the possibility that the properties of GCU7 could be explained by the tidal disruption of a horizontal branch star by an intermediate-mass black hole. We use new data to show that the lack of evolution in the X-ray or optical properties of the source over the last 20 years rules out this scenario. Instead, we use CLOUDY simulations to demonstrate that the optical emission lines are consistent with an outflow from an ultra-compact X-ray binary where a compact object - likely a neutron star (NS) - is accreting above the Eddington limit from a helium white dwarf (He WD). This binary would have dynamically formed from a direct collision between a NS and a red giant, or else via an exchange interaction. The ULX is predicted to evolve to lower mass transfer rates over time and eventually become a doppelganger to the well-studied ultra-compact X-ray binaries in Galactic GCs such as 4U 1820-30. These results show the utility of using extragalactic GCs to study short-lived phases in dynamical binary evolution that occur too rarely to be observed in Galactic clusters.","['Kwangmin Oh', 'Kristen C.

Dark photon constraints using the UHE gamma-ray emission from galactic sources. A Phenomenological Study,"Context: Dark photons (Dph) appear in theories beyond the Standard Model of particles (SM). Under certain conditions, it is possible to have a mixing between SM photons and Dphs that should be observed as anomalies in the spectrum of astrophysical sources. Aim: To either find evidence of, or set constraints on the existence of Dphs with masses in the range of $\mu\text{eV}$ using observations of two galactic sources observed at TeV energies. Methods: Using the flux of the Crab Nebula and MGRO J1908+06 at TeV energies reported by HAWC and LHAASO observatories, and assuming a model where Dphs can mix with SM photons in the vacuum; we compute the Test Statistic (TS) to search for evidence of Dphs in the form of variations/attenuation in the observed spectrum. Results: We do not find statistically significant evidence of the existence of $\mu\text{eV}$ Dphs. Then, we compute the 68\% C.L. and 95\% C.L. exclusion regions for Dphs with masses in the range from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}~\text{eV}$ and mixing angles with values between 0.01 and 1.0.","['Arlette Melo', 'Sergio Hernández', 'Rubén Alfaro']",6.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18813,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['dark matter – dark photons – gamma-ray astronomy 1'],2025-02-03
Exploring Constraints on Axion-like Particles with the Observations for blazar Mrk 501,"Oscillations between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons in astrophysical magnetic fields can lead to irregularities in the high energy gamma ray spectra of blazars. The magnetic field within the blazar jet plays a crucial role in shaping these effects, with its strength in the emission region being an important parameter determined by multi-wavelength observations. However, the origin of the high energy bump observed in the spectral energy distribution of some blazars is a topic of debate, with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios providing plausible explanations that result in different magnetic field strengths in the emission region. In this study, we investigate the impact of magnetic field configurations on the constraints of ALP parameters. We consider both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios for the blazar Mrk 501 and derive the corresponding jet magnetic field strengths. Additionally, we explore two jet magnetic field models: one with a toroidal component and the other with helical and tangled components. By analyzing the spectra of Mrk 501 observed by MAGIC and Fermi-LAT from 2017-06-17 to 2019-07-23, which are well-described by both emission scenarios, we derive constraints on the ALP parameters. Our results demonstrate that both the emission scenario and the magnetic field structure play a significant role in deriving these constraints, with the hadronic model leading to much more stringent limits compared to the leptonic model.","['Ting Zhou', 'Lin-Qing Gao', 'Xiao-Jun Bi', 'Peng-Fei Yin', 'Wenbin Lin']",5.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18860,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-02-03
The Local Galactic Transient Survey Applied to an Optical Search for Directed Intelligence,"We discuss our transient search for directed energy systems in local galaxies, with calculations indicating the ability of modest searches to detect optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources in the closest galaxies. Our analysis follows Lubin (2016) where a messenger civilization follows a beacon strategy we call ""intelligent targeting."" We plot the required laser time to achieve an SNR of 10 and find the time for a blind transmission to target all stars in the Milky Way to be achievable for local galactic civilizations. As high cadence and sky coverage is the pathway to enable such a detection, we operate the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) targeting M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) via Las Cumbres Observatory's (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. We explore the ability of modest searches like the LGTS to detect directed pulses in optical and near-infrared wavelengths from Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) at these distances and conclude a civilization utilizing less powerful laser technology than we can construct in this century is readily detectable with the LGTS's observational capabilities.

Energy evolution of cosmic-ray mass and intensity measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory,"The Pierre Auger Observatory has conducted measurements of the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays using different methods. Utilizing both surface and fluorescence detectors (SD and FD), the Observatory provides unprecedented precision in understanding these particles. While primarily designed to measure ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the FD's high-elevation telescopes and the dense arrays of SD stations enable observations down to 6 PeV and 60 PeV, respectively. To determine the depth of shower maximum, a critical parameter for identifying primary particle types, both direct longitudinal profile measurements from the FD and indirect signal analyses from the SD are employed. An energy evolution of the mass of primary particles, as well as of the spectral index of the flux intensity, are observed and characterized by features described in the presented work. The measurements benefit from the joint operation of the FD and SD, delivering a systematic uncertainty of 14% in energy determination and an accumulated exposure reaching 80 000 km$^2$ sr yr at the highest energies.",['Vladimír Novotný'],3.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19002,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-02-03
Gas accretion at high redshift: cold flows all the way,"We study in detail how massive galaxies accrete gas through cosmic time using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the High-z Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) and the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) projects. We find that accretion through cold filaments at high redshift (z ~ 2-4) is a key factor in maintaining the high star formation rates (> 100 Msun/yr) observed in these galaxies, and that more than 75% of the total gas participating in the star formation process is accreted via this channel at high z even in haloes well above 10^12 Msun. The low volume occupancy of the filaments allows plenty of space for massive gas outflows generated by the vigorous star formation and AGN activity, with the cold incoming gas and the hot outflowing gas barely interacting. We present a model based on a Bayesian hierarchical formalism that accurately describes the evolution of the cold fraction accretion with redshift and halo mass. Our model predicts a relatively constant critical mass (Mc) for the cold-to-hot transition up to z ~ 1.3 and an evolving critical mass log(Mc) proportional to log(1+z)^1.7 at higher redshift. Overall, our findings provide deeper insight into the cosmic evolution of gas accretion modes and offer a robust framework for understanding how cold accretion contributes to galaxy growth across different epochs.","['Stefan Waterval', 'Carlo Cannarozzo', 'Andrea V.

Discovery of ionized circumstellar gas emission around the long-period Cepheid $\ell$ Carinae with ALMA,"Cepheid circumstellar emissions have previously been detected via both infrared excess and infrared interferometric observations at a few stellar radii. Those studies have shown that these circumstellar emission can be produced by ionized gas, however there is no direct observational evidence to confirm this hypothesis. In this letter we explore the continuum emission and a spectrum of the bright and long-period Cepheid, $\ell$~Car ($P=35.56\,$day) at millimeter-wavelengths in order to detect possible effects of ionized gas emission. We presented ALMA observations of $\ell$ Car in two spectral setups in Band~6 (near 212 and 253\,GHz, respectively) and we compared the measured flux density to one expected for the stellar continuum. We also derived the spectral index and probed the presence of Radio Recombination Lines (RRL). We report statistically significant emission of about 3.5$\,$mJy in the two spectral ranges, which is about 2.5 times the stellar continuum emission. For the first time, we are also able to derive the spectral index of the flux density ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), $\alpha=+1.26\pm$0.44 ($\sim$3$\sigma$ error), which is characteristic of partially optically thick ionized gas emission. Additionally, we discovered an emission line from a RRL of hydrogen H29$\alpha$ centered on the stellar rest velocity, smaller in spatial extent than about 0\farcs2 ($\lesssim 100\,$AU), with a symmetric profile with a width at half power of 55.3$\pm$7.5\,\kms (1$\sigma$ error). It confirms the presence of ionized gas emission near $\ell$~Car. The millimeter emission detected from $\ell$ Car can be attributed to ionized gas emission from the Cepheid's chromosphere. Further radio interferometric observations are necessary to confirm the occurrence of these ionized gas envelopes around Cepheids of different pulsation periods.","['V. Hocdé', 'T. Kamiński', 'M.

"The evolution of cosmic ray electrons in the cosmic web: seeding by AGN, star formation and shocks","Several processes in the Universe convert a fraction of gas kinetic energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons, making them observable at radio wavelengths, or contributing to a dormant reservoir of low-energy cosmic rays in cosmic structures. We present a new suite of cosmological simulations, with simple galaxy formation models calibrated to work at a specific spatial resolution, tailored to study all most important processes of injection of relativistic electrons in evolving large-sale structures: accretion and merger shocks, feedback from active galactic nuclei and winds from star forming regions. We also follow the injection of magnetic fields by active galactic nuclei and star formation, and compute the observational signatures of these mechanisms. We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the most volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of fossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding mechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to physical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale radio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons. We derive an approximated formula to predict the number of fossil cosmic ray electrons injected by z=0 by the total activity of shocks, AGN and star formation in the volume of halos. By looking at the maximum possible contribution to the magnetisation of the cosmic web by all our simulated sources, we conclude that galaxy formation-related processes, alone, cannot explain the values of Faraday Rotation of background polarised sources recently detected using LOFAR.","['F.

Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers,"We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.","['Yong Gao', 'Kota Hayashi', 'Kenta Kiuchi', 'Alan Tsz-Lok Lam', 'Hao-Jui Kuan', 'Masaru Shibata']",18.0,22.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19053,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-02-03

Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation,"The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ < M$_{\star}$ < 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.","['J. Maldonado', 'G. M.

Rapid follow-up of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias,"The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.","['Lluís Galbany', 'Claudia P.

It's not $\sigma_8$ : constraining the non-linear matter power spectrum with the Dark Energy Survey Year-5 supernova sample,"The weak gravitational lensing magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is sensitive to the matter power spectrum on scales $k>1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, making it unwise to interpret SNe Ia lensing in terms of power on linear scales. We compute the probability density function of SNe Ia magnification as a function of standard cosmological parameters, plus an empirical parameter $A_{\rm mod}$ which describes the suppression or enhancement of matter power on non-linear scales compared to a cold dark matter only model. While baryons are expected to enhance power on the scales relevant to SN Ia lensing, other physics such as neutrino masses or non-standard dark matter may suppress power. Using the Dark Energy Survey Year-5 sample, we find $A_{\rm mod} = 0.77^{+0.69}_{-0.40}$ (68\% credible interval around the median). Although the median is consistent with unity there are hints of power suppression, with $A_{\rm mod} < 1.09$ at 68\% credibility.","['Paul Shah', 'T. M. Davis', 'M. Vincenzi', 'P. Armstrong', 'D.

Testing the Rossby Paradigm: Weakened Magnetic Braking in early K-type Stars,"There is an intricate relationship between the organization of large-scale magnetic fields by a stellar dynamo and the rate of angular momentum loss due to magnetized stellar winds. An essential ingredient for the operation of a large-scale dynamo is the Coriolis force, which imprints organizing flows on the global convective patterns and inhibits the complete cancellation of bipolar magnetic regions. Consequently, it is natural to expect a rotational threshold for large-scale dynamo action and for the efficient angular momentum loss that it mediates through magnetic braking. Here we present new observational constraints on magnetic braking for an evolutionary sequence of six early K-type stars. To determine the wind braking torque for each of our targets, we combine spectropolarimetric constraints on the large-scale magnetic field, Ly-alpha or X-ray constraints on the mass-loss rate, as well as uniform estimates of the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. As identified previously from similar observations of hotter stars, we find that the wind braking torque decreases abruptly by more than an order of magnitude at a critical value of the stellar Rossby number. Given that all of the stars in our sample exhibit clear activity cycles, we suggest that weakened magnetic braking may coincide with the operation of a subcritical stellar dynamo.","['Travis S.

Temperature-redshift relation in energy-momentum-powered gravity models,"There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations includes a term proportional to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. Previous works have suggested that these models can lead to a recent accelerating universe without a cosmological constant, but they can also be seen as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, which are observationally constrained to be close to the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Here we show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and background cosmological data, showing that this power is constrained to be about $|n|<0.01$ and $|n|<0.1$, respectively in models without and with a cosmological constant, and improving previous constraints on this parameter by more than a factor of three. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two.","['C. J. A. P. Martins', 'A. M. M.

FAUST XX. The chemical structure and temperature profile of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino at 20-50 au,"Young low-mass protostars often possess hot corinos, compact, hot and dense regions bright in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs). Besides of their prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the chemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim to explore the iCOMs emission at < 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs (CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO), and derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for each species were derived at 1$\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a non-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram analysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption from foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time unbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot corino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au, with the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au), HCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate of the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission sizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of 20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We observed, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The derived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing and optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or a gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.","['J.

Three-dimensional Structure of Incomplete Carbon-Oxygen Detonations in Type Ia Supernovae,"Carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation with reactions terminating either after burning of C$^{12}$ in the leading C$^{12}$ + C$^{12}$ reaction or after burning of C$^{12}$ and O$^{16}$ to Si-group elements may occur in the low-density outer layers of exploding white dwarfs and be responsible for the production of intermediate-mass elements observed in the outer layers of Type Ia supernovae. Basic one-dimensional properties of CO-detonations have been summarized in our previous work. This paper presents the results of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of low-density CO-detonations and discusses their multidimensional stability, cellular structure, and propagation through a constant low-density background. We find three-dimensional CO detonations to be strikingly different from their one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional detonations are significantly more robust and capable of propagating without decay compared to highly unstable and marginal one- and two- dimensional detonations. The detonation cell size and whether burning of C$^{12}$ in a three-dimensional detonation wave is followed by the subsequent O$^{16}$ burning is sensitive to both the background density and the initial C$^{12}$ to O$^{16}$ mass ratio. We also discuss the possible implications for understanding the observed early time bumps in light-curves.","['A. Khokhlov', 'I. Dominguez', 'A.Y. Chtchelkanova', 'P. Hoeflich', 'E. Baron', 'K.

Unveiling the largest structures in the nearby Universe: Discovery of the Quipu superstructure,"For a precise determination of cosmological parameters we need to understand the effects of the local large-scale structure of the Universe on the measurements. They include modifications of the cosmic microwave background, distortions of sky images by large-scale gravitational lensing, and the influence of large-scale streaming motions on measurements of the Hubble constant. The streaming motions, for example, originate from mass concentrations with distances up to 250 Mpc. In this paper we provide the first all-sky assessment of the largest structures at distances between 130 and 250 Mpc and discuss their observational consequences, using X-ray galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution. Among the five most prominent superstructures found, the largest has a length longer than 400 Mpc with an estimated mass of about 2 10e17 Msun. This entity, which we named Quipu, is the largest cosmic structure discovered to date. These superstructures contain about 45% of the galaxy clusters, 30% of the galaxies, 25% of the matter, and occupy a volume fraction of 13%, thus constituting a major part of the Universe. The galaxy density is enhanced in the environment of superstructures out to larger distances from the nearest member clusters compared to the outskirts of clusters in the field. We find superstructures with similar properties in simulations based on Lambda-CDM cosmology models. We show that the superstructures should produce a modification on the cosmic microwave background through the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect. Searching for this effect in the Planck data we found a signal of the expected strength, however, with low significance. Characterising these superstructures is also important for astrophysical research, for example the study of the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution as well as for precision tests of cosmological models.","['Hans Boehringer', 'Gayoung Chon', 'Joachim Truemper', 'Renee C.

Circumstellar and circumbinary discs in multiple stellar systems,"The interplay between stellar multiplicity and protoplanetary discs represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, offering key insights into the processes of planet formation. Protoplanetary discs act as cradles for planetary systems, yet their evolution and capacity to form planets are profoundly affected by gravitational forces within multiple stellar systems. This review synthesises recent advancements in observational and theoretical studies to explore the rich diversity of circumstellar and circumbinary discs within multiple stellar systems. We examine how stellar companions shape disc morphology through truncation, spirals, and misalignment. We also outline how dust dynamics and planetesimal formation are impacted by stellar multiplicity. On top of this, observations at high angular resolution reveal detailed disc structures, while simulations offer key insights into their evolution. Last, we consider the implications of stellar multiplicity for planetary system architectures, emphasising the diversity of planetary outcomes in such environments. Looking ahead, coordinated efforts combining high-resolution observations with advanced numerical models will be critical for unravelling the role of multiple stellar systems in shaping planetary formation and evolution.","['Nicolás Cuello', 'Antoine Alaguero', 'Pedro P.

Systematic Bias in Ionizing Radiation Escape Fraction Measurements from Foreground Large-Scale Structures,"We investigate the relationship between the Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the environmental density of galaxies, focusing on its implications for the measurement of ionizing radiation escape fractions. Using a sample of 268 spectroscopically confirmed background galaxies at 2.7<z<3.0 and a galaxy density map at z~2.5 within the COSMOS field, we measure the Lya transmission photometrically, leveraging the multiwavelength data available from the COSMOS2020 catalog. Our results reveal a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between Lya optical depth and galaxy density contrast, suggesting that overdense regions are enriched in neutral gas, which could bias escape fraction measurements. This emphasizes the need to account for the large-scale structure of the IGM in analyses of ionizing radiation escape fractions, and highlights the advantages of a photometric approach for increasing the number of sampled lines of sight across large fields. The photometric redshifts provided by upcoming all-sky surveys, such as Euclid, will make it possible to account for this effect across widely separated fields.","['C. Scarlata', 'W. Hu', 'M. J.

Kilonova Emission from Neutron Star Mergers with Different Equations of State,"Kilonova is an optical-infrared transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei from binary neutron star mergers. Its observational characteristics depend on the mass and the nuclide composition of meger ejecta, which are sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star. We use astrophysical conditions derived from different EoSs as nucleosynthesis inputs to explore the impact of various EoS on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis and the kilonova emission. Our results show that both the abundance patterns of merger ejecta and kilonova light curves are strongly dependent on the neutron star EoSs. Given the mass of two neutron stars, the merger with a softer EoS tends to generate a larger amount of ejected material, and may lead to a brighter kilonova peak luminosity. The relationship between the neutron star EoS and the peak luminosity provides a probe for constraining the properties of EoS in multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers.","['Wu-Zimo Qiumu', 'Meng-Hua Chen', 'Qiu-Hong Chen', 'En-Wei Liang']",6.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19305,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Nuclear Theory'],RAA,,"['kilonova', 'neutron star merger', 'Burbidge et al', 'equation of state 1 INTRODUCTION It has long been considered that mergers of neutron stars or neutron star black hole systems are promising as- trophysical sites for the production of heavy elements beyond iron through the rapid neutron capture process (r-process', 'r-process nucleosynthesis']",2025-02-03

Modeling submillimeter galaxies in cosmological simulations: Contribution to the cosmic star formation density and predictions for future surveys,"Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) constitute a key population of bright star-forming galaxies at high redshift. These galaxies challenge galaxy formation models, particularly in reproducing their observed number counts and redshift distributions. Furthermore, although SMGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), their precise role remains uncertain. Upcoming surveys, such as the Ultra Deep Survey with the TolTEC camera, are expected to offer valuable insights into SMG properties and their broader impact. Robust modeling of SMGs in a cosmologically representative volume is necessary to investigate their nature in preparation for next-generation submillimeter surveys. We implement and test parametric relations derived from radiative transfer calculations across three cosmological simulations: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and FLAMINGO. Particular emphasis is placed on the FLAMINGO due to their large volume and robust statistical sampling of SMGs. Based on the model that best reproduces observations, we forecast submillimeter fluxes within the simulations, analyze the properties of SMGs, and evaluate their evolution over cosmic time. Our results show that the FLAMINGO reproduces the observed redshift distribution and source number counts of SMGs without requiring a top-heavy initial mass function. On the other hand, the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG show a deficit of bright SMGs. We find that SMGs with S850 > 1 mJy contribute up to 27% of the SFRD at z=2.6 in the FLAMINGO, consistent with recent observations. Flux density functions reveal a rise in SMG abundance from z = 6 to 2.5, followed by a sharp decline in the number of brighter SMGs from z = 2.5 to 0. Leveraging the SMG population in FLAMINGO, we forecast that the TolTEC UDS will detect 80,000 sources over 0.8 deg^2 at 1.1 mm (at the 4{\sigma} detection limit), capturing about 50% of the cosmic SFRD at z=2.5.","['Ankit Kumar', 'M.

High-cadence observations of galactic nuclei by the future two-band UV-photometry mission QUVIK,"The Quick Ultra-Violet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krtička et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zajaček et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim$ 0.1-1 day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z<1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($<20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening).","['Michal Zajaček', 'Norbert Werner', 'Henry Best', ""Jolie Esme L'Heureux"", 'Jakub Řípa', 'Monika Pikhartová', 'Martin Mondek', 'Filip Münz', 'Lýdia Štofanová', 'Petr Kurfürst', 'Matúš Labaj', 'Izzy L.

Low dust mass and high star-formation efficiency at $z>12$ from deep ALMA observations,"We investigate the dust mass build-up and star formation efficiency of two galaxies at $z>12$, GHZ2 and GS-z14-0, by combining ALMA and JWST observations with an analytical model that assumes dust at thermal equilibrium. We obtained $3\sigma$ constraints on dust mass of $\log M_{\rm dust}/M_{\odot}<5.0$ and $<5.3$, respectively. These constraints are in tension with a high dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta but are consistent with models with a short metal accretion timescale at $z>12$. Given the young stellar ages of these galaxies ($t_{\rm age}\sim10\,{\rm Myrs}$), dust grain growth via accretion may still be ineffective at this stage, though it likely works efficiently to produce significant dust in galaxies at $z\sim7$. The star formation efficiencies, defined as the SFR divided by molecular gas mass, reach $\sim10\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ in a 10\,Myr timescale, aligning with the expected redshift evolution of `starburst' galaxies with efficiencies that are $\sim0.5$--$1\,{\rm dex}$ higher than those in main-sequence galaxies. This starburst phase seems to be common in UV-bright galaxies at $z>12$ and is likely associated with the unique conditions of the early phases of galaxy formation, such as bursty star formation and/or negligible feedback from super-Eddington accretion. Direct observations of molecular gas tracers like [C\,{\sc ii}] will be crucial to further understanding the nature of bright galaxies at $z>12$.","['Ikki Mitsuhashi', 'Jorge A. Zavala', 'Tom J.L.C.

A Spectroscopically Calibrated Prescription for Extracting PAH Flux from JWST MIRI Imaging,"We introduce a prescription for estimating the flux of the 7.7 micron and 11.3 micron\ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features from broadband JWST/MIRI images. Probing PAH flux with MIRI imaging data has advantages in field of view, spatial resolution, and sensitivity compared with MIRI spectral maps, but comparisons with spectra are needed to calibrate these flux estimations over a wide variety of environments. For 267 MIRI/MRS spectra from independent regions in the four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) early release science program, we derive synthetic filter photometry and directly compare estimated PAH fluxes to those measured from detailed spectral fits. We find that for probing PAH 7.7 micron, the best combination of filters is F560W, F770W, and either F1500W or F2100W, and the best for PAH 11.3 micron is F560W, F1000W, F1130W, and F1500W. The prescription with these combinations yields predicted flux densities that typically agree with values from spectral decomposition within ~7% and ~5% for PAH 7.7 and 11.3 micron, respectively.","['Grant P.

Occultation constraints on solar system formation models,"The process by which a system of non-luminous bodies form around a star is fundamental to understanding the origins of our own solar system and how it fits into the context of other systems we have begun to study around other stars. Some basics of solar system formation have emerged to describe the process by which dust and gas around a newly formed star evolve into what we see today. The combination of occultation observations and the flyby observations by New Horizons of the Cold-Classical Kuiper Belt Object (CCKBO), (498958) Arrokoth, has provided essential new constraints on formation models through its three-dimensional shape.

Pulsar timing and polarimetry: results and perspectives,"Pulsar timing, i.e. the analysis of the arrival times of pulses from a pulsar, is a powerful tool in modern astrophysics. It allows us to measure the time delays of an electromagnetic signal caused by a number of physical processes as the signal propagates from the source to the observer. Joint analysis of an ensemble of pulsars (Pulsar Timing Arrays, PTAs) can be used to address a variety of astrophysical challenges, including the problem of direct detection of space-time metric perturbations, in particular those induced by gravitational waves. Here we present a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the field of pulsar timing, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in the detection of stochastic background of nHz gravitational waves, reported by a number of international collaborations such as NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves), European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), which are joining their efforts within the International PTA (IPTA).

Hyperluminous Supersoft X-ray Sources in the Chandra Catalog,"Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole.

Characterization of the Teledyne COSMOS Camera: A Large Format CMOS Image Sensor for Astronomy,"The Teledyne COSMOS-66 is a next-generation CMOS camera designed for astronomical imaging, featuring a large-format sensor ($8120 \times 8120$ pixels, each $10 \mu m$), high quantum efficiency, high frame rates, and a correlated multi-sampling mode that achieves low read noise. We performed a suite of bench-top and on-sky tests to characterize this sensor and analyze its suitability for use in astronomical instruments. This paper presents measurements of linearity, conversion gain, read noise, dark current, quantum efficiency, image lag, and crosstalk. We found that the sensor exhibits nonlinear response below 5% of saturation. This nonlinearity is plausibly attributable to the trapping of electrons in each pixel. We developed and implemented a pixel-by-pixel nonlinearity correction, enabling accurate photometric measurements across the dynamic range. After implementing this correction, operating in the correlated multi-sampling mode, the sensor achieved an effective read noise of $2.9 e^-$ and dark current of $0.12 e^-/pix/s$ at $-25^\circ C$. The quantum efficiency exceeded 50% from 250 nm to 800 nm, peaking at 89% at 600 nm. We observed significant optical crosstalk between the pixels, likely caused by photoelectron diffusion. To demonstrate the sensor's astronomical performance, we mounted it on the WINTER 1m telescope at Palomar Observatory. These tests confirmed that the linearity calibration enables accurate stellar photometry and validated our measured noise levels. Overall, the COSMOS-66 delivers similar noise performance to large-format CCDs, with higher frame rates and relaxed cooling requirements. If pixel design improvements are made to mitigate the nonlinearity and crosstalk, then the camera may combine the advantages of low-noise CMOS image sensors with the integration simplicity of large-format CCDs, broadening its utility to a host of astronomical science cases.","['Christopher Layden', 'Jill Juneau', 'Gustav Pettersson', 'Nathan Lourie', 'Benjamin Schneider', 'Beverly LaMarr', 'F.

Hypervelocity Stars Trace a Supermassive Black Hole in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are produced by the Hills mechanism when a stellar binary is disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The HVS Survey detected 21 unbound B-type main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's outer halo that are consistent with ejection via the Hills mechanism. We revisit the trajectories of these stars in light of proper motions from {\it Gaia} DR3 and modern constraints on the Milky Way -- Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) orbit. We find that half of the unbound HVSs discovered by the HVS Survey trace back not the Galactic Center, but to the LMC. Motivated by this finding, we construct a forward-model for HVSs ejected from an SMBH in the LMC and observed through the selection function of the HVS Survey. The predicted spatial and kinematic distributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed distributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering of HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from the LMC are boosted by $\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the LMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as HVS candidates. We find that the birth rate and clustering of LMC HVSs cannot be explained by supernova runaways or dynamical ejection scenarios not involving a SMBH. From the ejection velocities and relative number of Magellanic vs. Galactic HVSs, we constrain the mass of the LMC SMBH to be $10^{5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}} M_{\odot}$ ($\simeq 6\times10^5 M_{\odot}$).","['Jiwon Jesse Han', 'Kareem El-Badry', 'Scott Lucchini', 'Lars Hernquist', 'Warren Brown', 'Nico Garavito-Camargo', 'Charlie Conroy', ""Re'em Sari""]",9.0,16.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00102,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-02-04

This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R$^2$, between predictions and ground truth of R$^2 \approx 0.94$ when testing on simulations, which decreases to R$^2 \approx 0.60$ when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude $r_{\text{BCG}} \leq 16.5$, yields R$^2 \approx 0.99$. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least $z\approx 0.6$. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.","['Patrick Janulewicz', 'Tracy M.A. Webb', 'Laurence Perreault-Levasseur']",10.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00104,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-02-04
TABASCAL II: Removing Multi-Satellite Interference from Point-Source Radio Astronomy Observations,"In the first TABASCAL paper we showed how to calibrate in the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources by simultaneously isolating the trajectories and signals of the RFI sources. Here we show that we can accurately remove RFI from simulated MeerKAT radio interferometry target data, for a single frequency channel, corrupted by up to 9 simultaneous satellites with average RFI amplitudes varying from weak to very strong (1 - 1000 Jy). Additionally, TABASCAL also manages to leverage the RFI signal-to-noise to phase calibrate the recovered astronomical signal. TABASCAL effectively performs a suitably phased up fringe filter for each RFI source which allows essentially perfect removal of RFI across all strengths. As a result, TABASCAL reaches image noises equivalent to the uncorrupted, no-RFI, case. Consequently, point-source science with TABASCAL almost matches the no-RFI case with near perfect completeness for all RFI amplitudes. In contrast the completeness of AOFlagger and idealised 3$\sigma$ flagging drops below 40% for strong RFI amplitudes where recovered flux errors are $\sim$10x-100x worse than those from TABASCAL. Finally we highlight that TABASCAL works for both static and varying astronomical sources.","['Chris Finlay', 'Bruce A.

New constraints on the evolution of the MHI-M* scaling relation combining CHILES and MIGHTEE-HI data,"The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust HI-stellar mass relation at z=0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean HI masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate HI masses, and derive the scaling relation log10(MHI) = (0.32 +- 0.04)log10(M*) + (6.65 +- 0.36). Our findings indicate that galaxies at z=0.36 are HI richer than those at z=0, but HI poorer than those at z=1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect HI exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate HI relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming SKA era.","['Alessandro Bianchetti', 'Francesco Sinigaglia', 'Giulia Rodighiero', 'Ed Elson', 'Mattia Vaccari', 'D.J.

Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution,"Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution are fast (dynamical-timescale) interactions in binary stars that drastically alter their evolution. They are key to understanding a plethora of astrophysical phenomena. Stellar mergers are thought to produce blue straggler stars, blue supergiants, and stars with peculiar rotation and surface chemical abundances. Common-envelope evolution is proposed as a key stage in the formation of gravitational wave sources, X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables, and other systems. A significant fraction (tens of percent) of binary stars undergo such a phase during their evolution. In this chapter, we first discuss processes leading to a stellar merger or common-envelope phase. We then explain these complex interactions, starting from underlying physical principles like entropy sorting in stellar mergers and the energy formalism in common envelopes. This is followed by a more complete picture revealed by three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. The outcomes of these interactions are discussed comprehensively and special emphasis is given to the role of magnetic fields. Both stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution remain far from fully understood, and we conclude by highlighting open questions in their study.","['Fabian R. N. Schneider', 'Mike Y. M.

Caught in the Act of Quenching: A Population of Post-Starburst Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies,"We report the discovery of post-starburst ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), identified through spectroscopic analysis with KCWI at the Keck II Telescope. Our analysis is based on a sample of 44 candidate UDGs selected from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes) program. Our measured spectroscopic redshifts reveal $\sim 80\%$ of the entire KCWI sample exhibit large physical sizes ($R_{e} \gtrsim 1~{\rm kpc}$) and low surface brightnesses ($24 \lesssim \mu_{0,g} \lesssim 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) which categorize them as UDGs. We find $20\%$ of the confirmed UDG population contain post-starburst (or K+A) features, characterized by minimal to no emission in H$\beta$ indicative of quenched star formation and a predominant presence of spectral A-type stars. Studying the local environments of the post-starburst UDGs, we find that half are isolated systems, including two systems that reside $2-3~R_{\rm vir}$ away from potential nearby massive hosts ($M_{\star} >10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). Without the influence of external environmental mechanisms, these post-starburst UDGs may represent systems experiencing star formation feedback such that a recent burst may lead to (at least temporary) quenching. Overall, our results highlight the potentially diverse quenching pathways of UDGs in the local Universe.","['Loraine Sandoval Ascencio', 'M. C.

The Velocity Field Olympics: Assessing velocity field reconstructions with direct distance tracers,"The peculiar velocity field of the local Universe provides direct insights into its matter distribution and the underlying theory of gravity, and is essential in cosmological analyses for modelling deviations from the Hubble flow. Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct the density and velocity fields at $z \lesssim 0.05$, typically constrained by redshift-space galaxy positions or by direct distance tracers such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, or Type Ia supernovae. We introduce a validation framework to evaluate the accuracy of these reconstructions against catalogues of direct distance tracers. Our framework assesses the goodness-of-fit of each reconstruction using Bayesian evidence, residual redshift discrepancies, velocity scaling, and the need for external bulk flows. Applying this framework to a suite of reconstructions -- including those derived from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm and from linear theory -- we find that the non-linear BORG reconstruction consistently outperforms others. We highlight the utility of such a comparative approach for supernova or gravitational wave cosmological studies, where selecting an optimal peculiar velocity model is essential. Additionally, we present calibrated bulk flow curves predicted by the reconstructions and perform a density-velocity cross-correlation using a linear theory reconstruction to constrain the growth factor, yielding $S_8 = 0.69 \pm 0.034$. This result is in significant tension with Planck but agrees with other peculiar velocity studies.","['Richard Stiskalek', 'Harry Desmond', 'Julien Devriendt', 'Adrianne Slyz', 'Guilhem Lavaux', 'Michael J.

"TRAPPIST-1 d: Exo-Venus, Exo-Earth or Exo-Dead?","TRAPPIST-1 d is generally assumed to be at the boundary between a Venus-like world and an Earth-like world, although recently published works on TRAPPIST-1 b and c raise concerns that TRAPPIST-1 d may be similarly devoid of a substantial atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1 d is also relatively understudied in comparison with TRAPPIST-1 e. The latter has generally appeared to be within the habitable zone of most atmospheric modeling studies. Assuming that TRAPPIST-1 d still retains a substantial atmosphere, we demonstrate via a series of 3D general circulation model experiments using a dynamic ocean that the planet could reside within the habitable zone in a narrow parameter space. At the same time, it could also be an exo-Venus or exo-Dead-type world or in transition between between one of these. Studies like this can help distinguish between these types of worlds.",['M. J.

Conservative limits on primordial black holes from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations,"Primordial black holes (PBH) may constitute a considerable fraction of dark matter. In this work we use the recent observations by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations to set direct limits on stellar-mass range PBHs. We evaluate the merger rates of PBH binaries. Those type of interactions contribute to what is a minimum of PBH merger rates at low redshifts detectable by LVK. Thus, they allow us to derive what is the most conservative upper limits on the presence of merging PBH binaries in the gravitational-wave observations. We study the cases where PBHs have a monochromatic mass-distribution and the case case with a distribution described by a log-normal function. To derive limits on PBHs, we simulate binaries with masses following the relevant mass-distributions and merger rates as a function of redshift, up to $z\sim 0.8$, relevant for the current LVK observations. In those simulations we also take into account that the LVK observatories measure the detected black hole binaries' masses with a finite resolution. In comparing to the LVK observations, we combine the simulated PBH binaries with the binaries following a power-law mass- and redshift-distribution. The latter binaries dominate the observed population of LVK detections. Our derived limits on the mass fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs is in the range of $10^{-3}$ to O(1), depending on the exact assumptions relating to the PBH binaries properties. For reasonable assumptions on those PBH binaries' properties before their evolution inside dark matter halos, we get that fraction to be in the range of $5\times 10^{-3} - 0.1$, for PBH masses of 5-80 $M_{\odot}$. Our limits even with a conservative choice on evaluating the low-redshift merger rates provide some of the most competitive limits in the mass range of 5-40 $M_{\odot}$.

Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution,"Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.","['Kundan Kadam', 'Eduard Vorobyov', 'Peter Woitke', 'Shantanu Basu', 'Sierk van Terwisga']",8.0,24.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00161,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,"['Protoplanetarydisks–Stars:winds', 'outflows–Stars:formation–Methods:numerical–Magnetohydrodynamics(MHD) 1']",2025-02-04
Linking stellar populations to HII regions across nearby galaxies. II. Infrared Reprocessed and UV Direct Radiation Pressure in HII Regions,"Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H$\alpha$-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in $\approx 18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where $L_{\rm F2100W}/L_{\rm H\alpha}^{\rm corr} \gtrsim 75$. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.","['Debosmita Pathak', 'Adam Leroy', 'Todd Thompson', 'Laura Lopez', 'Ashley Barnes', 'Daniel Dale', 'Ian Blackstone', 'Simon C.

Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of a Coronal Mass Ejection Observed During the Near-radial Alignment of Solar Orbiter and Earth,"Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) are the primary sources of geomagnetic storms at Earth. Negative out-of-ecliptic component (Bz) of magnetic field in the ICME or its associated sheath region is necessary for it to be geo-effective. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs containing data-constrained flux ropes are more suitable for forecasting their geo-effectiveness as compared to hydrodynamic models of the CME. ICMEs observed in situ by radially aligned spacecraft can provide an important setup to validate the physics-based heliospheric modeling of CMEs. In this work, we use the constant-turn flux rope (CTFR) model to study an ICME that was observed in situ by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and at Earth, when they were in a near-radial alignment. This was a stealth CME that erupted on 2020 April 14 and reached Earth on 2020 April 20 with a weak shock and a smoothly rotating magnetic field signature. We found that the CTFR model was able to reproduce the rotating magnetic field signature at both SolO and Earth with very good accuracy. The simulated ICME arrived 5 hours late at SolO and 5 hours ahead at Earth, when compared to the observed ICME. We compare the propagation of the CME front through the inner heliosphere using synthetic J-maps and those observed in the heliospheric imager data and discuss the role of incorrect ambient SW background on kinematics of the simulated CME. This study supports the choice of the CTFR model for reproducing the magnetic field of ICMEs.","['Talwinder Singh', 'Dinesha V. Hegde', 'Tae K. Kim', 'Nikolai V.

Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun's High-Latitude Rotation Rate. II: Simulations and New Measurements,"In a previous paper, I described a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from space-time maps of polar faculae observed in the 6767 Å continuum by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Sheeley (2024). Now, I have tested the technique by applying it to simulated images whose faculae have known speeds, and I have been able to recover those speeds with an accuracy better than 0.01 km s$^{-1}$. Repeated measurements of the Sun's polar faculae gave the same high-latitude profile as before, but with a slightly faster synodic rotation rate of 9.$^{\circ}$10 day$^{-1}$ and a rotation period of 39.6 days. Applying this space-time tracking procedure to magnetic flux elements observed with the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), I obtained a similar rotation profile with a speed of 9.$^{\circ}$55 day$^{-1}$ and a synodic rotation period of 37.7 days. These rates are comparable to polar rotation rates, obtained by other techniques, but the new latitude profiles are noticeably flatter than the quartic fits to those prior measurements.",['Neil R.

A Fast Periodicity Detection Algorithm Sensitive to Arbitrary Waveforms,"A reexamination of period finding algorithms is prompted by new large area astronomical sky surveys that can identify billions of individual sources having a thousand or more observations per source. This large increase in data necessitates fast and efficient period detection algorithms. In this paper, we provide an initial description of an algorithm that is being used for detection of periodic behavior in a sample of 1.5 billion objects using light curves generated from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data (Bellm et al. 2019; Masci et al. 2018). We call this algorithm ""Fast Periodicity Weighting"" (FPW), derived using a Gaussian Process (GP) formalism. A major advantage of the FPW algorithm for ZTF analysis is that it is agnostic to the details of the phase-folded waveform. Periodic sources in ZTF show a wide variety of waveforms, some quite complex, including eclipsing objects, sinusoidally varying objects also exhibiting eclipses, objects with cyclotron emission at various phases, and accreting objects with complex waveforms. We describe the FPW algorithm and its application to ZTF, and provide efficient code for both CPU and GPU.","['Douglas P. Finkbeiner', 'Thomas A. Prince', 'Samuel E.

BatAnalysis -- A Comprehensive Python Pipeline for Swift BAT Time-Tagged Event Data Analysis,"The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded aperture gamma-ray instrument with a large field of view that was designed to detect and localize transient events. When a transient is detected, either on-board or externally, the BAT saves time-tagged event (TTE) data which provides the highest quality information of the locations of the photons on the detector plane and their energies. This data can be used to produce spectra, lightcurves, and sky images of a transient event. While these data products are produced by the Swift Data Center and can be produced by current software, they are often preset to certain time and energy intervals which has limited their use in the current time domain and multi-messenger environment. Here, we introduce a new capability for the BatAnalysis python package to download and process TTE data under an open-source pythonic framework that allows for easy interfacing with other python packages. The new capabilities of the BatAnalysis software allows for TTE data to be used by the community in a variety of advanced customized analyses of astrophysical sources which BAT may have TTE data for, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB), Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters, magnetars, and many other sources. We highlight the usefulness of the BatAnalysis package in analyzing TTE data produced by an on-board GRB trigger, a FRB external trigger, a sub-threshold detection of the LMXB EXO 0748-676, and an external trigger of a GRB that BAT detected during a slew.","['Tyler Parsotan', 'David M.

GWSkyNet-Multi II: an updated deep learning model for rapid classification of gravitational-wave events,"Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a deep learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values, making it more interpretable. For significant O4 event alerts issued between May 2023 and December 2024, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.","['Nayyer Raza', 'Man Leong Chan', 'Daryl Haggard', 'Ashish Mahabal', 'Jess McIver', 'Audrey Durand', 'Alexandre Larouche', 'Hadi Moazen']",6.0,19.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00297,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,['Gravitational wave astronomy (675) — Gravitational wave sources (677) — Neural networks (1933) 1'],2025-02-04

The [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of $\leq$ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} $\pm$ 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H$_2$ outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H$_2$ emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 $\pm$ 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {$\pm$ 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.","['Mayank Narang', 'Nagayoshi Ohashi', 'John J.

Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry,"Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.","['Zhi-Fu Gao', 'Biao-Peng Li', 'L.C.

Sun-as-a-star analysis of simulated solar flares,"Context: Stellar flares have an impact on habitable planets. To relate the observations of the Sun with those of stars, one needs to use a Sun-as-a-star analysis, that is, to degrade the resolution of the Sun to a single point. With the data of the Sun-as-a-star observations, a simulation of solar flares is required to provide a systemic clue for the Sun-as-a-star study.Aims: We aim to explore how the Sun-as-a-star spectrum varies with the flare magnitude and location based on a grid of solar flare models.Methods: Using 1D radiative hydrodynamics modeling and multi-thread flare assumption, we obtained the spectrum of a typical flare with an enhancement of chromospheric lines.Result: The Sun-as-a-star spectrum of the H$\alpha$ line shows enhanced and shifted components, which are highly dependent on the flare magnitude and location. The equivalent width $\Delta\mathrm{EW}$ is a good indicator of energy release. The bisector method can be used to diagnose the sign of the line-of-sight velocity in the flaring atmosphere. For both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, the Sun-as-a-star spectrum of a limb flare tends to be wider and shows a dip in the line center. In particular, we propose two quantities to diagnose the magnitude and location of the stellar flares. Besides this, caution must be taken when calculating the radiation energy, since the astrophysical flux-to-energy conversion ratio is dependent on the flare location.","['H. C. Yu', 'J. Hong', 'M. D.

Short-Period Small Planets with High Mutual Inclinations are more Common around Metal-Rich Stars,"We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs<12, Rp<4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.","['Xinyan Hua', 'Sharon Xuesong Wang', 'Dongsheng An', 'Songhu Wang', 'Yang Hunag', 'Dichang Chen', 'Johannes Buchner', 'Wei Zhu', 'Fei Dai', 'Jiwei Xie']",5.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00442,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],ApJL,,[],2025-02-04
A New Interpretation for the Hot Corona in Active Galactic Nuclei,"This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thinparabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of themagnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within thisreconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativisticelectrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by theaccretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic frameworkto parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power ofthe IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitativeinvestigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can bedirectly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. Thetheoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation ofour model.","['Yu Zhao', 'Yan-Rong Li', 'Jian-Min Wang']",8.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00504,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,"The Astrophysical Journal, 979:201 (12pp), 2025 February 1",['Supermassive black holes (1663)'],2025-02-04
Radial Gradients and Intrinsic Scatter in MaNGA Galaxies,"We derive stellar population parameters and their radial gradients within 0.65 R$_e$ for spatially resolved spectra of 2417 early-type galaxies from the MaNGA survey with stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) between 50 kms$^{-1}$ and 340 kms$^{-1}$. We invert a grid of metallicity-composite stellar population models to find mean age and the abundances of C, N, Na, Mg, and Fe. These models have significant improvements compared to past models, including isochrones that respond to individual element abundances.Globally, age rises with $\sigma$ while [Fe/H] gently falls. Individual light element abundances strengthen with $\sigma$ but strengthen faster for log($\sigma$)$>$2.0. [Fe/H] shows a maximum at log($\sigma$)$\approx$2.0, falling to either side. Light element [X/Fe] anticorrelate with [Fe/H]. Heterogeneity as measured by astrophysical scatter is highest in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, most dramatically for age, Fe, and N.For galaxy-internal parameters, age shows nearly flat radial gradients in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, slightly negative at high $\sigma$. The mean radial gradient in [Fe/H] is negative and light element [X/Fe]s fall. Intrinsic scatter in gradients is highest in high-$\sigma$ galaxies, most dramatically for age and Fe. Evidently, nearly as many galaxies form inside-out as form outside-in.A near-zero radial gradient in age and light elements coupled with a mild [Fe/H] gradient supports the hierarchical merging scenario for ETG evolution. IllustrisTNG hierarchical simulations reproduce the age structure we find, show the abundance slope changes at log($\sigma$)$\approx$2.0 that we observe, and exhibit flat gradients similar to those we derive, although the abundances predicted by IllustrisTNG are significantly higher than our observations overall.","['Tathagata Pal', 'Guy Worthey']",33.0,32.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00531,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Galaxy abundances (574) — Galaxy ages(576) — Galaxy chemical evolution(580) — Galaxy evolu- tion(594) — Galaxy stellar content(621) 1'],2025-02-04
Correlation between formaldehyde and methanol in prestellar cores,"Formaldehyde is a key precursor in the formation routes of many complex organic molecules (COMs) in space. It is also an intermediate step in CO hydrogenation sequence that leads to methanol formation on the surface of interstellar grains in cold dense prestellar cores where pristine ices are formed. Various chemical models successfully reproduce the COMs abundances in cold cores, however, they consistently overpredict the abundance of formaldehyde by an order of magnitude. This results in an inverse H2CO:CH3OH abundance ratios obtained in the astrochemical simulations as compared to the observed values. In this work, we present a homogeneous data set of formaldehyde observational maps obtained towards seven dense cores in the L1495 filament with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Resolving the spatial distribution of the molecules is essential to test the chemical models. We carefully estimate the formaldehyde column densities and abundances to put reliable observational constraints on the chemical models of cold cores. Through numerous tests, we aim to constrain the updated chemical model MONACO to better align with the observed formaldehyde abundance and its ratio to methanol. In particular, we elaborate on the branching ratio of the CH3 + O reaction at low temperatures. The revised MONACO model reproduces abundances of both methanol and formaldehyde within an order of magnitude. However the model tends to overproduce formaldehyde and underpredict methanol. Consequently, the model systematically overestimates the H2CO:CH3OH ratio, although it remains within an order of magnitude of the values derived from observations.","['A. F. Punanova', 'K.

The Influence of Stellar Chromospheres and Coronae on Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy,"A main source of bias in transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres is magnetic activity of the host star in the form of stellar spots, faculae or flares. However, the fact that main-sequence stars have a chromosphere and a corona, and that these optically thin layers are dominated by line emission may alter the global interpretation of the planetary spectrum, has largely been neglected. Using a JWST NIRISS/SOSS data set of hot Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we show that even at near-IR and IR wavelengths, the presence of these layers leads to significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere. Accounting for these stellar outer layers thus improves the atmospheric fit of HAT-P-18 b, and increases its best-fit atmospheric temperature from 536 K to 736 K, a value much closer to the predicted equilibrium temperature of 852 K. Our analysis also decreases the best-fit abundance of CO2 by almost an order of magnitude. The approach provides a new window to the properties of chromospheres/corona in stars other than our Sun.","['Volker Perdelwitz', 'Adam Chaikin-Lifshitz', 'Aviv Ofir', 'Oded Aharonson']",9.0,13.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00553,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,"['Stellar atmospheres 1', 'Hot Jupiters', 'Exoplanet atmospheres']",2025-02-04
PyLMT: A transient detection pipeline for the 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope,"The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m aperture, zenith-pointing telescope with a field-of-view of 22', situated in the foothills of the Himalayas. The telescope operates in continuous survey mode, making it a useful instrument for time-domain astronomy, particularly for detecting transients, variable stars, active galactic nuclei variability, and asteroids. This paper presents the PyLMT transient detection pipeline to detect such transient/varying sources in the ILMT images. The pipeline utilises the image subtraction technique to compare a pair of images from the same field, identifying such sources in subtracted images with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based real/bogus classifiers. The test accuracies determined for the real/bogus classifiers ranged from 94% to 98%. The resulting precision of the pipeline calculated over candidate alerts in the ILMT frames is 0.91. It also houses a CNN-aided transient candidate classifier that classifies the transient/variable candidates based on host morphology. The test accuracy of the candidate classifier is 98.6%. It has the provision to identify catalogued asteroids and other solar system objects using public databases. The median execution time of the pipeline is approximately 29 minutes per image of 17 minutes exposure. Relevant CNNs have been trained on data acquired with the ILMT during the cycle of October-November 2022. Subsequent tests on those images have confirmed the detection of numerous catalogued asteroids, variable stars, and other uncatalogued sources. The pipeline has been operational and has detected 12 extragalactic transients, including 2 new discoveries in the November 2023-May 2024 observation cycle.","['Kumar Pranshu', 'Kuntal Misra', 'Bhavya Ailawadhi', 'Monalisa Dubey', 'Naveen Dukiya', 'Sara Filali', 'Paul Hickson', 'Brajesh Kumar', 'Vibhore Negi', 'Jean Surdej']",26.0,21.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00556,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,"['asteroids: general – stars: variables: general – software:machine learning 1 INTRODUCTION Modernskysurveyprogramshaveenabledthediscoveryoftransient events in large numbers', 'surveys – telescopes – transients:supernovae – minor planets']",2025-02-04
"The 4m International Liquid Mirror Telescope: Construction, operation, and science","The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) project was motivated by the need for an inexpensive 4 metre diameter optical telescope that could be devoted entirely to astronomical surveys. Its scientific programmes include the detection and study of transients, variable objects, asteroids, comets, space debris and low surface brightness galaxies. To this end, a collaboration was formed between the Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics (Liège University, Belgium), several Canadian universities (University of British Columbia, Laval University, University of Montreal, University of Toronto, York University, University of Victoria) and the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES, India). After several years of design work in Belgium and construction in India on the ARIES Devasthal site, the telescope saw its first light on 29 April 2022. Its commissioning phase lasted from May 2022 until June 2023 (beginning of the monsoon). The ILMT was inaugurated on 21 March 2023 and has been in regular operation since October 2023. The telescope continuously observes the sky passing at the zenith using the SDSS g', r', and i' filters.

Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field,"The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.","[""Hannah O'Brennan"", 'John A.

A 16 Myr super-Neptune in Upper-Centaurus Lupus and a preliminary survey of transiting planets in Sco-Cen with TESS,"Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b.

Unions with UNIONS: Using galaxy-galaxy lensing to probe galaxy mergers,"(ABRIDGED) We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to investigate how the dark matter (DM) haloes and stellar content of galaxies with $0.012 \leq z \leq 0.32$ and $10 \leq \log_{10}(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \leq 12$ change as a result of the merger process. To this end, we construct two samples of galaxies obtained from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), comprising 1 623 post-mergers and $\sim$30 000 non-merging controls, that live in low-density environments to use as our lenses. These samples are weighted to share the same distributions of stellar mass, redshift, and geometric mean distance to a galaxy's three nearest neighbours to ensure differences in the lensing signal are due to the merger process itself. We do not detect a significant difference in the excess surface density profile of post-mergers and non-merging controls with current data. Fitting haloes composed of a point-like stellar mass component and an extended DM structure described by a Navarro-Frenk-White profile to the lensing measurements yields, for both samples, halo masses of $M_\text{halo}\sim 4\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a moderately negative correlation between $M_\text{halo}$ and concentration $c$. . . . Extreme merger-induced starbursts, in which more than 60 percent of the stars are formed in the burst, are ruled out at the 95 per cent confidence level. Although we do not find merger-induced differences in the DM haloes and stellar content of galaxies with our current data, application of our methods to upcoming surveys that are able to provide samples $\sim$10$\times$ larger than our current catalogue are expected to detect the weak-lensing signatures of mergers and further constrain their properties.","['Isaac Cheng', 'Jack Elvin-Poole', 'Michael J.

SIGNALS on the mixing of oxygen and nitrogen in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946,"As part of the SIGNALS survey, which comprises a sample of approximately 40 nearby galaxies observed with the Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE, we present a study of metal mixing in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. Taking advantage of the blue sensitivity of our setup, we measure the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of 638 H II regions, and focus our analysis on the abundance fluctuations about the radial gradients. We detect an azimuthal variation of about 0.1 dex in these abundances across the NE spiral arm, with the leading edge being more metal-poor than the trailing edge. This result aligns with galaxy simulations, where radial gas flows along the spiral arms lead to dilution on the leading edge and enrichment on the trailing edge, due to the presence of radial metallicity gradients. Our 2D analysis reveals that oxygen and nitrogen exhibit comparable spatial correlation scales, despite the different injection energies and distinct nucleosynthetic origins -- core-collapse supernovae in the case of oxygen and primarily AGB stars for nitrogen. The observed similarity suggests that stellar processes drive these two elements into the ISM over equivalent spatial scales.","['Fabio Bresolin', 'David Fernández-Arenas', 'Laurie Rousseau-Nepton', 'Ray Garner III', 'Almudena Zurita', 'Carmelle Robert', 'Laurent Drissen', 'René Pierre Martin', 'Philippe Amram', 'Salvador Duarte Puertas', 'Gabriel Savard', 'Sébastien Vicens', 'Mykola Posternak']",11.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00649,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: abundances – galaxies: ISM – galaxies: spiral – H iiregions – galaxies: individual: NGC 6946'],2025-02-04
Machine learning based Photometric Redshifts for Galaxies in the North Ecliptic Pole Wide field: catalogs of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts,"We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2.

Green peas in the southern sky: Broad-band color selection and spectroscopic follow up,"We present a systematic search for 1696 Green Pea (GP) galaxy candidates in the southern hemisphere selected from the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2) and provide preliminary results from spectroscopic follow-up observations of 26 targets chosen among them. Our selection criteria include the colors in $gri$-bands and compact morphology in the color composite images. The multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution fitting shows that the selected GP candidates exhibit star formation rates up to several tens $\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the mean stellar mass of $\mathrm{log}\,M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot=8.6$, GP candidates are located at roughly 1 dex above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.3$. Spectroscopic follow-up observations of the GP candidates with Gemini/GMOS are underway. All 26 targets are spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=0.3-0.41$ and have [OIII] equivalent width larger than 85$Å$, classified to be starbursts with low to moderate dust attenuation.

Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-ray Burst rest-frame spectral lags using Profile Likelihood,"We reanalyze the spectral lag data for 56 GRBs in the cosmological rest frame to search for Lorentz Invariance Violation using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use the technique of profile likelihood to deal with the nuisance parameters corresponding to a constant astrophysical spectral lag in the GRB rest frame and the unknown intrinsic scatter, while the parameter of interest is the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) for LIV. With this method, we do not obtain a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ up to the Planck scale. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits on $E_{QG}$ in a seamless manner.

Detection of Ubiquitous Circumbinary Matter in Hot Subdwarfs Formed from Common-Envelope Ejections,"The formation of compact binary systems is largely driven by their evolution through a common envelope (CE) phase, crucial for understanding phenomena such as type Ia supernovae and black hole mergers. Despite their importance, direct observational evidence for CE material has been elusive due to the transient nature of these envelopes. Numerical simulations suggest that some envelope material may persist post-ejection. In this study, we investigate circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding hot subdwarf (sdB) stars, focusing on material ejected during the CE phase of binary evolution. We analyze Ca II K absorption lines in 727 sdB candidates from the LAMOST-LRS survey, selecting 145 stars with strong absorption features, indicating the presence of CSM. We compare the velocities of the Ca II K lines with the systemic velocities of sdB binaries, confirming that the material originates from ejected common-envelope material. The results show that the CSM persists long after the CE event, suggesting the formation of a stable, long-lived circumstellar environment around sdB stars. This study enhances our understanding of the role of CSM in post-CE evolution and provides new insights into the physical processes shaping the evolution of sdB binaries.","['Jiangdan Li', 'Christian Wolf', 'Jiao Li', 'Yangping Luo', 'Jingkun Zhao', 'Bingqiu Chen', 'Lin Zhang', 'Shi Jia', 'Xuefei Chen', 'Zhanwen Han']",10.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00822,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],MNRAS,,"['(stars:) binaries: close - (stars:) subdwarfs - stars: evolution - (stars:) circumstellar matter 1 INTRODUCTION Compactbinariesarefundamentaltomodernastrophysics', 'white dwarfs', 'neutron stars', 'cataclysmic variables', 'progenitors of type Ia supernovae', 'compris- ing diverse systems such as double black holes', 'and hot subdwarf binaries', 'X-ray binaries']",2025-02-04
Adiabatic Index in Fluid Models of Collisionless Black Hole Accretion,"Models of highly sub-Eddington accretion onto black holes commonly use a single fluid model for the collisionless, near-horizon plasma. These models must specify an equation of state. It is common to use an ideal gas with $p = (\gamma - 1) u$ and $\gamma = 4/3, 13/9,$ or $5/3$, but these produce significantly different outcomes. We discuss the origins of this discrepancy and the assumptions underlying the single fluid model. The main result of this investigation is that under conditions relevant to low luminosity black hole accretion the best choice of single fluid adiabatic index is close to but slightly less than $5/3$. Along the way we provide a simple equilibrium model for the relation between the ion-to-electron dissipation ratio and the ion to electron temperature ratio and explore the implications for electron temperature fluctuations in Event Horizon Telescope sources.",['Charles F.

Secondary spins of extreme mass ratio inspirals: Measurement precision and astrophysical applications,"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a secondary (stellar mass) black hole (BH) orbiting around a supermassive BH, are one of the primary targets for future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The spin of the secondary BH encodes the formation history of the stellar mass BH and the formation process of the EMRI. In this work, we construct a kludge EMRI waveform model taking the secondary spin into account and forecast the measurement precision of the secondary spin by future spaceborne GW detectors with the Fisher information matrix. We find the secondary spin should be measured with a reasonably good precision for generic eccentric and inclined EMRIs, though the measurement precision largely degrades for low-eccentricity and nearly equatorial EMRIs. As an example of its astrophysical applications, we propose that the secondary spin can be used for distinguishing dry (loss cone) EMRIs (where the secondary BHs were born in the collapse of individual massive stars and are of low spin) and Hills EMRIs (where the secondary BHs are remnants of massive star binaries and the secondary spins follow a bimodal distribution).","['Qiuxin Cui', 'Wen-Biao Han', 'Zhen Pan']",5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00856,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-02-04
The survey of planetary nebulae in Andromeda (M31) VII. Predictions of a major merger simulation model compared with chemodynamical data of the disc and inner halo substructures,"The nearest spiral galaxy, M31, exhibits a kinematically hot stellar disc, a global star formation episode ~2-4 Gyr ago, and conspicuous substructures in its stellar halo, suggestive of a recent accretion event. Recent chemodynamical measurements in the M31 disc and inner halo can be used as additional constraints for N-body hydrodynamical simulations that successfully reproduce the disc age-velocity dispersion relation and star formation history, together with the morphology of the inner halo substructures. We combine an available N-body hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger (mass ratio 1:4) with a well-motivated chemical model to predict abundance distributions and gradients in the merger remnant at z=0. We computed the projected phase space and the [M/H] distributions for the substructures in the M31 inner halo, i.e. the GS, the NE-, W- Shelves. We compare these chemodynamical properties of the simulated M31 remnant with recent measurements for the M31 stars in the inner halo. This major merger model predicts (i) distinct multiple components within each of the substructure; (ii) a high mean metallicity and large spread in the GS, NE- and W- Shelves, explaining various photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements; (iii) simulated phase space diagrams that qualitatively reproduce various features identified in the projected phase space of the substructures in published data from the DESI; (iv) a large distance spread in the GS, as suggested by previous tip of the RGB measurements, and (v) phase space ridges caused by several wraps of the secondary, as well as up-scattered main M31 disc stars, that also have plausible counterparts in the observed phase spaces. These results provide further independent arguments for a major satellite merger in M31 ~3 Gyr ago and a coherent explanation for many of the observational results that make M31 look so different from the MW.","['C.

Ultradense Dark Matter Halos with Poisson Noise from Stellar-Mass Primordial Black Holes,"In this study, we investigate the effect of Poisson noise, originating from the discrete distribution of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs), on the abundance of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). We incorporate the contribution of PBH shot noise into the power spectrum and modify the primordial power spectrum to calculate the differential mass function of UDMHs across various models, while accounting for crucial physical and geometrical factors. We further compare our results with observational constraints on the abundance of compact dark matter and the mass distribution of PBHs derived from the thermal history of the early Universe. Our findings demonstrate that the mass of PBHs contributing to Poisson noise plays a pivotal role in determining the abundance of UDMHs. Moreover, we show that Poisson noise from lighter PBHs strengthens the single-component dark matter scenario, whereas the corresponding effect from heavier PBHs supports the multi-component dark matter scenario.",['Saeed Fakhry'],2.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00914,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-02-04

In this work, we present a brief historical description of the main events related to the discovery of cosmic acceleration and the basic elements of theoretical and observational aspects of dark energy. Regarding the historical perspective, we outline some of the key milestones for tracing the journey from Einstein's proposal of the cosmological constant to the type Ia supernovae results. Conversely, on the theoretical/observational side, we begin by analyzing cosmic acceleration within the context of the standard cosmological model, i.e., in terms of the cosmological constant. In this case, we show how a positive cosmological constant drives accelerated expansion and discuss the main observational aspects, such as updated results and current cosmological tensions. We also explore alternative descriptions of dark energy, encompassing dynamic and interacting dark energy models.","['Rodrigo von Marttens', 'Jailson Alcaniz']",9.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00923,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-04
Modeling Cosmic Rays at AGN Jet-Driven Shock Fronts,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is a key physical mechanism proposed to regulate star formation, primarily in massive galaxies. In particular, cosmic rays associated with AGN jets have the potential to efficiently suppress cooling flows and quench star formation. The locus of cosmic ray production and their coupling to gas play a crucial role in the overall self-regulation process. To investigate this in detail, we conduct high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations of a massive $10^{14} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo using the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We explore a variety of AGN jet feedback scenarios with cosmic rays, examining different values for the cosmic ray energy fraction in jets, cosmic ray coupling sites (in the black hole vicinity versus at the large-scale jet-driven shock front), and jet precession parameters. Our findings indicate that when cosmic rays are injected near the black hole, they efficiently inhibit black hole accretion by suppressing the density before the jet propagates out to large radii. As a result, this leads to episodic black hole accretion, with the jet not having sufficient energy flux to reach large radii and impact cooling flows. Conversely, if the cosmic rays are injected at the jet-driven shock front, not only does the jet sustain a higher overall energy flux for an extended period, but it also disperses cosmic rays out to larger radii, more effectively suppressing the cooling flow. Furthermore, the period and angle of jet precession can influence the position of shock fronts. We identify an optimal range of jet precession periods ($\sim$ tens of Myr) that generates shocks at the inner circumgalactic medium, where cooling flows are most severe. We report that this specific configuration offers the most effective scenario for cosmic rays at the shock front to suppress the cooling flow and star formation.","['Kung-Yi Su', 'Greg L.

QUOKKA-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- III. Outflow loading and phase structure as a function of galactic environment,"We present results from a suite of 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of supernova-driven outflows from galactic disc regions with a range of gas surface density, metallicity, and supernova scale height. We use this suite to quantify how outflow properties -- particularly the loading factors for mass, metallicity, and energy -- vary with these parameters. We find that the winds fall into three broad categories: steady and hot, multiphase and moderately bursty, and cool and highly bursty. The first of these is characterised by efficient metal and energy loading but weak mass loading, the second by moderate loading of mass, metals, and energy, and the third by negligible metal and energy loading but substantial mass loading. The most important factor in determining the kind of wind a galaxy will produce is the ratio of supernova to gas gas scale heights, with the latter set by a combination of supernova rate, metallicity-dependent cooling rate, and the gravitational potential. These often combine in counterintuitive ways -- for example increased cooling causes cold clouds to sink into the galactic midplane more rapidly, lowering the volume-filling factor of dense gas and making the environment more favourable for strong winds. Our findings suggest that the nature of galactic winds is likely highly sensitive to phenomena such as runaway stars occuring at a large height and dense gas and are poorly captured in most simulations, and that metal loading factors for type Ia supernovae may be substantially larger than those for type II, with important implications for galactic chemical evolution.","['Aditi Vijayan', 'Mark R.

The Simons Observatory: Validation of reconstructed power spectra from simulated filtered maps for the Small Aperture Telescope survey,"We present a transfer function-based method to estimate angular power spectra from filtered maps for cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. This is especially relevant for experiments targeting the faint primordial gravitational wave signatures in CMB polarisation at large scales, such as the Simons Observatory (SO) small aperture telescopes. While timestreams can be filtered to mitigate the contamination from low-frequency noise, usual methods that calculate the mode coupling at individual multipoles can be challenging for experiments covering large sky areas or reaching few-arcminute resolution. The method we present here, although approximate, is more practical and faster for larger data volumes. We validate it through the use of simulated observations approximating the first year of SO data, going from half-wave plate-modulated timestreams to maps, and using simulations to estimate the mixing of polarisation modes induced by an example of time-domain filtering. We show its performance through an example null test and with an end-to-end pipeline that performs inference on cosmological parameters, including the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The performance demonstration uses simulated observations at multiple frequency bands. We find that the method can recover unbiased parameters for our simulated noise levels.","['Carlos Hervías-Caimapo', 'Kevin Wolz', 'Adrien La Posta', 'Susanna Azzoni', 'David Alonso', 'Kam Arnold', 'Carlo Baccigalupi', 'Simon Biquard', 'Michael L.

K-dwarf Radius Inflation and a 10-Gyr Spin-down Clock Unveiled through Asteroseismology of HD~219134 from the Keck Planet Finder,"We present the first asteroseismic analysis of the K3\,V planet host HD~219134, based on four consecutive nights of radial velocities collected with the Keck Planet Finder. We applied Gold deconvolution to the power spectrum to disentangle modes from sidelobes in the spectral window, and extracted 25 mode frequencies with spherical degrees $0\leq\ell\leq3$. We derive the fundamental properties using five different evolutionary-modeling pipelines and report a mass of 0.763 $\pm$ 0.020 (stat) $\pm$ 0.007 (sys) M$_\odot$, a radius of 0.748 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.002 (sys) R$_\odot$, and an age of 10.151 $\pm$ 1.520 (stat) $\pm$ 0.810 (sys) Gyr. Compared to the interferometric radius 0.783 $\pm$ 0.005~R$_\odot$, the asteroseismic radius is 4\% smaller at the 4-$\sigma$ level -- a discrepancy not easily explained by known interferometric systematics, modeling assumptions on atmospheric boundary conditions and mixing lengths, magnetic fields, or tidal heating. HD~219134 is the first main-sequence star cooler than 5000~K with an asteroseismic age estimate and will serve as a critical calibration point for stellar spin-down relations. We show that existing calibrated prescriptions for angular momentum loss, incorporating weakened magnetic braking with asteroseismically constrained stellar parameters, accurately reproduce the observed rotation period. Additionally, we revised the masses and radii of the super-Earths in the system, which support their having Earth-like compositions. Finally, we confirm that the oscillation amplitude in radial velocity scales as $(L/M)^{1.5}$ in K dwarfs, in contrast to the $(L/M)^{0.7}$ relation observed in G dwarfs. These findings provide significant insights into the structure and angular momentum loss of K-type stars.","['Yaguang Li', 'Daniel Huber', 'J. M. Joel Ong', 'Jennifer van Saders', 'R. R.

Revisiting turbulent properties of solar convection with 3D radiative hydrodynamic modeling,"We discuss the turbulent structure and dynamics of the upper solar convection zone using a 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulation model at 45 degrees latitude. The model reveals the self-formation of meridional flows, the leptocline, and the radial differential rotation. Unlike previous studies, the model shows a complex variation of the characteristic scales of turbulent flows with depth. In particular, an increase in the characteristic convective scale is trackable within an individual snapshot up to a depth of 7 Mm, near the bottom of the hydrogen ionization zone, where turbulent flows become weaker and more homogeneous. However, the turbulent spectra show an increase in scale with depth and a qualitative change in convective patterns below 7 Mm (near the bottom of the leptocline), suggesting changes in the diffusivity properties and energy exchange among different scales.","['Irina N.

"A Search for Eclipse Cycles Similar to the Hypersaros: Columbus and the Lunar Eclipse of March 14, 2025","The total lunar eclipse on March 14, 2025 UT occurs nearly exactly 521 years (one Hypersaros) after a similar eclipse on March 1, 1504 UT that is renowned for its importance to the voyage of Columbus to Jamaica.

We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We find that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies.

The Gravitational Wave Background from Massive Black Holes in the ASTRID Simulation,"Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have detected nanohertz gravitational waves, likely originating from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). The detected amplitude is unexpectedly higher than inferred from the electromagnetic measurements. We present new gravitational wave background (GWB) results from the ASTRID simulation. Its large volume and on-the-fly dynamical friction for MBHs provide new insights into the MBHB population, offering a more accurate assessment of its contribution to the observed GWB. ASTRID predicts a GWB from MBHBs of $h_c=2.8\times10^{-15}$, or $\sim45\%$ of the observed amplitude at $\sim 4\,{\rm nHz}$ and $h_c=2.5\times10^{-16}$ ($5\%$) with $h_c\propto f^{-1.6}$ at $\sim 30\,{\rm nHz}$. These predictions remain below current PTA constraints but align with previous empirical models based on the observed MBH mass functions. By comparison, TNG300 with post-processed MBH dynamics yields a range between $70-90\%$ ($20\% - 30\%$) of the observed levels at low (high) frequencies. At low frequencies, ASTRID predicts that the bulk of the GWB originates from MBHB with masses $M_{\rm tot}=1-3\times 10^9\,M_\odot$ peaking at $z\approx 0.3$, consistent with TNG300. Notably, both simulations predict significant GWB contribution from minor mergers ($q<0.2$) by up to $\sim 40\%$. By tracing the full merger trees of local MBHs in ASTRID, we show that they generate GWs at $\sim 10\%-80\%$ of the maximum signal assuming no accretion and recent equal-mass mergers. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of on-the-fly MBH dynamics, the lack of which leads to $3- 5$ times excessive mass growth by merger, and a similar boost to the GWB prediction.","['Nianyi Chen', 'Tiziana Di Matteo', 'Yihao Zhou', 'Luke Zoltan Kelley', 'Laura Blecha', 'Yueying Ni', 'Simeon Bird', 'Yanhui Yang', 'Rupert Croft']",5.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01024,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Gravitational waves— Supermassive black holes —Computational methods 1'],2025-02-04
X-ray Emission Properties of a Compact Symmetric Object Sample,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray observations obtained from \xmm\, and \chandra\, for a sample of bona-fide Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) to investigate their X-ray emission properties. Ultimately, we obtain 32 effective X-ray observational spectra from 17 CSOs. Most spectra can be well described by an absorbed single power-law model, with the exception of 6 spectra requiring an additional component in the soft X-ray band and 2 spectra exhibiting an iron emission line component. The data analysis results unveil the diverse characteristics of X-ray emission from CSOs. The sample covers X-ray luminosity ranging within $10^{40}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, intrinsic absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$) ranging within $10^{20}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and photon spectral index ($\Gamma_{\rm X}$) ranging within 0.75--3.0. None of the CSOs in our sample have $N_{\rm H}^{\rm int}$ > $10^{23}\rm~cm^{-2}$, indicating that the X-ray emission in these CSOs is not highly obscured. The distribution of $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ for these CSOs closely resembles that observed in a sample of radio-loud quasars and low-excitation radio galaxies (RGs). In the radio--X-ray luminosity panel, these CSOs exhibit a distribution more akin to FR I RGs than FR II RGs, characterized by higher luminosities. The positive correlation between $\Gamma_{\rm X}$ and the Eddington ratio, which has been noted in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei, is not observed in these CSOs. These findings suggest that although the contribution of the disk-corona system cannot be completely ruled out, jet/lobe radiation likely plays a dominant role in the X-ray emission of these CSOs.","['Ying-Ying Gan', 'Su Yao', 'Tan-Zheng Wu', 'Hai-Ming Zhang', 'Jin Zhang']",6.0,25.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01115,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['galaxies: active—galaxies: jets—radio continuum: galaxies —X-rays: galaxies 1'],2025-02-04
A Pristine View of Galactic Globular Clusters and their Peripheries: Omega Centauri,"The central regions of the globular cluster Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) have been extensively studied, but its outer regions and tidal structure have been less so. Gaia's astrometry uncovered substantial tidal substructure associated with $\omega$ Cen, yet the lack of chemical tagging makes these associations tenuous. In this paper, we utilise the Gaia-Synthetic CaHK-band photometry, metallicities from the Pristine survey and Gaia's astrometry to explore up to a clustercentric radius of 5 degrees from $\omega$ Cen. We identify $\omega$ Cen-like stars based on proper motion, colour-magnitude and colour-colour space, exploring the morphology, and stellar populations of the outer regions. Our probabilistic approach recovers the tidal tails of $\omega$ Cen, and we investigate the metallicity distribution of $\omega$ Cen ranging from a radius of 15 arcmin to the tidal radius, and beyond into the tidal tails. We present (1) two components between 15 arcmin and tidal radius at -1.83 and -1.45 dex which are also the dominant populations within 15 arcmin, and (2) the first evidence that the same two populations in the outer regions of the cluster are present outside the tidal radius and into the tidal tails. These populations are mixed about the stream, and are typically amongst the faintest stars in our sample; all indicating that the tidal tails are made of tidally stripped $\omega$ Cen stars.","['P.

The results suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line region but within the dusty torus. Furthermore, we find that the radiated power is significantly smaller than the total jet power, suggesting that most of the bulk energy remains within the jet even after passing through the blazar emission zone. These findings advance our understanding of particle acceleration, jet dynamics, and photon field interactions in FSRQs.","['P N Naseef Mohammed', 'T. Aminabi', 'C.

The cold neutral medium in filaments at high Galactic latitudes,"Context. The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be filamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with coherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the magnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of the physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the CNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary FIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are associated with known FIR/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a coherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is coincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely related to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity limitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with filamentary structures in FIR and/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for then CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been determined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity deviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to local turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent velocity dispersion of 2.48 < delta_vturb < 3.9 km/s. The CNM has a mean turbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +/- 1.6 km/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all, of the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in filaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.",['P. M. W.

KOBE 1: The first planetary system from the KOBE survey. Two planets likely residing in the sub-Neptune mass regime around a late K-dwarf,"K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and 29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and 12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty (>99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit from planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.","['O.

On field line slippage rates in the solar corona,"Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the solar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale magnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring information across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such as separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General Magnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the reconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field lines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local theory of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about reconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that location. The theory connects the concept of the field line slippage rate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the magnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned current density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar corona, discussed in relation to this new theory, is mathematically equivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic simulations. However, the general application of the theory is adaptable to the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence modelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The theory is illustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes: an analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the latter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if the given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the magnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.",['David MacTaggart'],9.0,17.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01251,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,Solar Physics,,"['Magnetic Reconnection', 'Theory']",2025-02-04
Exploring the capability of the HH 80-81 protostellar jet to accelerate relativistic particles,"Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays.Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration.Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission.Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.","['J. Méndez-Gallego', 'R. López-Coto', 'E. de Oña Wilhelmi', 'R. Fedriani', 'J. Otero-Santos', 'Y.

Testing the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs I.Hydrogen-dominated atmospheres,"The main goal of this work was to measure the masses and radii of white dwarfs that belong to widely separated, common proper motion binaries with non-degenerate companions. These can be assessed, independently from theoretical mass-radius relations, through measurements of gravitational redshifts and photometric radii. We studied 50 white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, performing a detailed analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 18,500) spectra by means of state-of-the-art grids of synthetic models and specialized software. Hence, we measured accurate radial velocities from the H-alpha and H-beta line-cores, thus obtaining the white dwarf gravitational redshifts. Jointly with a photometric analysis that is formalized by a Bayesian inference method, we measured precise white dwarf radii that allowed us to directly measure the white dwarf masses from their gravitational redshifts. The distributions of measured masses and radii agree within 6% (at the 1-sigma level) from the theoretical mass-radius relation, thus delivering a much smaller scatter in comparison with previous analyses that used gravitational redshift measurements from low-resolution spectra. A comparison against model-dependent spectroscopic estimates produces a larger scatter of 15% on the mass determinations. We find an agreement within ~10% from previous model-based, photometric mass estimates from the literature. Combining gravitational redshift measurements and photometric analysis of white dwarfs delivers precise and accurate, empirical estimates of their masses and radii. This work confirms the reliability of the theoretical mass-radius relation from the lightest to the heaviest white dwarfs in our sample (0.38-1.3 Msun).

Coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion,"Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale.",['Xing Wei'],3.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01302,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'Geophysics']",,,[],2025-02-04
In search for the Local Universe dynamical homogeneity scale with CF4++ peculiar velocities,"This article explores a groundbreaking update to the cosmography of the local Universe within z = 0.1, incorporating galaxy peculiar velocity datasets from the first data releases of WALLABY, FAST and DESI surveys. The galaxies with peculiar velocities currently selected in each survey is 655, 4796 and 4191 respectively. The new CF4++ compendium enables a more comprehensive study of the nearby Universe bulk flow dynamics. This analysis reveals that the dynamical scale of homogeneity is not yet reached in the interval [200-300] Mpc/h from the observer. This new data also refines the structure of local superclusters, revealing more spherical shapes and more clearly defined boundaries for key regions such as Great Attractor (Laniakea) and Coma. Very few measurements make a big difference in revealing the hidden Vela supercluster.","['Helene M. Courtois', 'Jeremy Mould', 'Amber M.

Deriving pulsar pair-production multiplicities from pulsar wind nebulae using H.E.S.S. and LHAASO observations,"Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.","['Samuel T. Spencer', 'Alison M.W.

Non-Keplerian Charged Accretion Disk Orbiting a Black Hole~Pulsar,"Recent studies have focused on how spinning black holes (BHs) within a binary system containing a strongly magnetized neutron star, then immersed in external magnetic fields, can acquire charge through mechanisms like the Wald process and how this charge could power pulsar-like electromagnetic radiation. Those objects called ``Black hole pulsar'' mimic the behaviour of a traditional pulsar, and they can generate electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic dipoles. Charged particles within an accretion disk around the black hole would then be influenced not only by the gravitational forces but also by electromagnetic forces, leading to different geometries and dynamics. In this context, we focus here on the interplay of the magnetic dipole and the accretion disk. We construct the equilibrium structures of non-conducting charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr black holes under the influence of a dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the BH. The dynamics of the accretion disk in such a system are shaped by a complex interplay between the non-uniform, non-Keplerian angular momentum distribution, the black hole's induced magnetic dipole, and the fluid's charge. We show how these factors jointly influence key properties of the disk, such as its geometry, aspect ratio, size, and rest mass density.","['Audrey Trova', 'Eva Hackmann']",9.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01359,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,"Universe, 11(2) (2025)",['accretion disk'],2025-02-04
Fifteen Years of M31* X-ray Variability and Flares,"We append an additional fifteen years (2009-2024) to the Chandra X-ray light curve of M31*, the supermassive black hole at the center of M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Extending and expanding on the work in Li et al. 2011, we show that M31* has remained in an elevated X-ray state from 2006 through at least 2016 (when regular Chandra monitoring ceased) and likely through 2024, with the most recent observations still showing an elevated X-ray flux. We identify one moderate flare in 2013 where the other nuclear X-ray sources are in low-flux states, making that flare a valuable target for followup with multiwavelength and multimessenger archival data. We extract a mostly uncontaminated spectrum for M31* from this observation, showing that its X-ray properties are similar to those observed at Sgr A* in its quiescent state by Baganoff et al. 2003. Furthermore, we find no substantial change in the source's hardness ratio in the 2006 and 2013 flares compared to the post-2006 elevated state, suggesting the these flares are increases in the regular X-ray emission mechanisms instead of entirely new emission modes. Our extended light curve for M31* provides valuable context for multimessenger or multiwavelength observations of nearby supermassive black holes.","['Stephen DiKerby', 'Shuo Zhang', 'Jimmy Irwin']",7.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01365,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],ApJ,,['High energy astrophysics (739) — X-ray astronomy (1810) — X-ray sources (1822) — Supermassive black holes (1663) — Black holes (162) — Andromeda Galaxy (39) 1'],2025-02-04
Ca II K Polar Network Index of the Sun: A Proxy for Historical Polar Magnetic Field,"The Sun's polar magnetic field is pivotal in understanding solar dynamo processes and forecasting future solar cycles. However, direct measurements of the polar field is only available since the 1970s. The chromospheric Ca II K polar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network regions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for polar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly calibrated, rotation-corrected Ca II K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1904-2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (2000-2022). We use both of those Ca II K archives to identify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold segmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the archives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from WSO (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.93) and the derived polar field based on an Advective Flux Transport Model (r > 0.91). The PNI series also shows a significant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson Observatory observations (r > 0.87) for both KoSO and Rome-PSPT data. Finally, we use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic field over a 119-year-long period, which includes last 11 solar cycles (Cycle 14-24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in 13-month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar field at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the ongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.","['Dibya Kirti Mishra', 'Bibhuti Kumar Jha', 'Theodosios Chatzistergos', 'Ilaria Ermolli', 'Dipankar Banerjee', 'Lisa A.

The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902,"A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that >M4 stars at ages of <10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.",['K.

Bayesian Deep-stacking for High-energy Neutrino Searches,"Following the discovery of the brightest high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, the further detection of fainter sources is more challenging. A natural solution is to combine fainter source candidates, and instead of individual detections, aim to identify and learn about the properties of a larger population. Due to the discreteness of high-energy neutrinos, they can be detected from distant very faint sources as well, making a statistical search benefit from the combination of a large number of distant sources, a called deep-stacking. Here we show that a Bayesian framework is well-suited to carry out such statistical probes, both in terms of detection and property reconstruction. After presenting an introductory explanation to the relevant Bayesian methodology, we demonstrate its utility in parameter reconstruction in a simplified case, and in delivering superior sensitivity compared to a maximum likelihood search in a realistic simulation.","['I.

Can the dynamo of spiral-arm galaxies be explained by anisotropic conductivity ?,"The possibility of generating a magnetic field by dynamo effect with anisotropic electrical conductivity rather than turbulent flow has been demonstrated theoretically (Plunian & Alboussière 2020) and experimentally (Alboussière et al. 2022). If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, the electrical currents will flow preferentially in certain directions rather than others, and a simple differential rotation will suffice to generate a magnetic field. In a galaxy with spiral arms, it is reasonable to assume that the electrical conductivity will be twice larger along the arms than in the perpendicular direction, suggesting the possibility of an anisotropic dynamo. However, a further geometrical criterion must be satisfied to obtain a dynamo (Plunian & Alboussière 2022). It is given by $\Omega' \cdot\sin p > 0$, where $p$ is the pitch angle of the spiral arms, with $p \in[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, and $\Omega'$ is the radial shear of the angular velocity. We find that the usual spiral arms galaxies, which satisfy $|\Omega'|<0$, do not satisfy this dynamo condition because they have trailing arms instead of leading arms. Even the galaxy NGC 4622, which has both trailing and leading arms, does not satisfy this dynamo condition either. This is confirmed by numerical simulations of the induction equation. Thus, for all the spiral arms galaxies known to date, the anisotropy of the spiral arms cannot explain the existence of galactic magnetic fields until further notice.","['Paul Gomez', 'Franck Plunian', 'Thierry Alboussière']",8.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01479,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['dynamo—anisotropy—spiral-arms galaxies—differential rotation 1'],2025-02-04
The effect of thermal misbalance on magnetohydrodynamic modes in coronal magnetic cylinders,"This study investigates the dispersion of magnetohydrodynamic waves influenced by thermal misbalance in a cylindrical configuration with a finite axial magnetic field within solar coronal plasmas. Specifically, it examines how thermal misbalance, characterized by two distinct timescales directly linked to the cooling and heating functions, influences the dispersion relation. This investigation is a key approach for understanding non-adiabatic effects on the behaviour of these waves. Our findings reveal that the effect of thermal misbalance on fast sausage and kink modes, consistent with previous studies on slabs, is small but slightly more pronounced than previously thought. The impact is smaller at long-wavelength limits but increases at shorter wavelengths, leading to higher damping rates. This minor effect on fast modes occurs despite the complex interaction of thermal misbalance terms within the dispersion relation, even at low-frequency limits defined by the characteristic timescales. Additionally, a very small amplification is observed, indicating a suppressed damping state for the long-wavelength fundamental fast kink mode. In contrast, slow magnetoacoustic modes are significantly affected by thermal misbalance, with the cusp frequency shifting slightly to lower values, which is significant for smaller longitudinal wavenumbers. This thermal misbalance likely accounts for the substantial attenuation observed in the propagation of slow magnetoacoustic waves within the solar atmosphere. The long-wavelength limit leads to an analytical expression that accurately describes the frequency shifts in slow modes due to misbalance, closely aligning with both numerical and observational results.","['S.M.Hejazi', 'T.

Non-conservation of linear momentum in widely used hierarchical methods in gravitational gas dynamics,"The paper considers the implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) in the PHANTOM code for the calculation of forces in a self-gravitating system. The gravitational interaction forces are divided into short-range and long-range interactions depending on the value of the tree opening parameter of the hierarchical kd-tree. It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for any pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for the entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an unphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a pair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found to be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of Keplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the number of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2. For smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly longer.","['M. Sh. Potashov', 'A. V.

Grid-based exoplanet atmospheric mass loss predictions through neural network,"The fast and accurate estimation of planetary mass-loss rates is critical for planet population and evolution modelling. We use machine learning (ML) for fast interpolation across an existing large grid of hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models, providing mass-loss rates for any planet inside the grid boundaries with superior accuracy compared to previously published interpolation schemes. We consider an already available grid comprising about 11000 hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models for training and generate an additional grid of about 250 models for testing purposes. We develop the ML interpolation scheme (dubbed ""atmospheric Mass Loss INquiry frameworK""; MLink) using a Dense Neural Network, further comparing the results with what was obtained employing classical approaches (e.g. linear interpolation and radial basis function-based regression). Finally, we study the impact of the different interpolation schemes on the evolution of a small sample of carefully selected synthetic planets. MLink provides high-quality interpolation across the entire parameter space by significantly reducing both the number of points with large interpolation errors and the maximum interpolation error compared to previously available schemes. For most cases, evolutionary tracks computed employing MLink and classical schemes lead to comparable planetary parameters at Gyr-timescales. However, particularly for planets close to the top edge of the radius gap, the difference between the predicted planetary radii at a given age of tracks obtained employing MLink and classical interpolation schemes can exceed the typical observational uncertainties. Machine learning can be successfully used to estimate atmospheric mass-loss rates from model grids paving the way to explore future larger and more complex grids of models computed accounting for more physical processes.","['Amit Reza', 'Daria Kubyshkina', 'Luca Fossati', 'Christiane Helling']",12.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01510,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Machine Learning'],,,['planets and satellites: atmospheres – hydrodynamics – Methods: numerical 1'],2025-02-04
Effects of planetary mass uncertainties on the interpretation of the reflectance spectra of Earth-like exoplanets,"Atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through reflected light spectroscopy is a key goal for upcoming direct imaging missions. A critical challenge in this endeavor is the accurate determination of planetary mass, which may influence the measurement of atmospheric compositions and the identification of potential biosignatures. In this study, we used the Bayesian retrieval framework ExoReL$^\Re$ to investigate the impact of planetary mass uncertainties on the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets observed in reflected light. Our results indicate that precise prior knowledge of the planetary mass can be crucial for accurate atmospheric retrievals if clouds are present in the atmosphere. When the planetary mass is known within 10\% uncertainty, our retrievals successfully identified the background atmospheric gas and accurately constrained atmospheric parameters together with clouds. However, with less constrained or unknown planetary mass, we observed significant biases, particularly in the misidentification of the dominant atmospheric gas. For instance, the dominant gas was incorrectly identified as oxygen for a modern-Earth-like planet or carbon dioxide for an Archean-Earth-like planet, potentially leading to erroneous assessments of planetary habitability and biosignatures. These biases arise because, the uncertainties in planetary mass affect the determination of surface gravity and atmospheric scale height, leading the retrieval algorithm to compensate by adjusting the atmospheric composition. Our findings emphasize the importance of achieving precise mass measurements-ideally within 10\% uncertainty-through methods such as extreme precision radial velocity or astrometry, especially for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.","['Mario Damiano', 'Zachary Burr', 'Renyu Hu', 'Jennifer Burt', 'Tiffany Kataria']",11.0,16.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01513,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-04
Towards a robust model-independent test of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal: ANAIS-112 results with six years of data,"The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.","['Julio Amaré', 'Jaime Apilluelo', 'Susana Cebrián', 'David Cintas', 'Iván Coarasa', 'Eduardo García', 'María Martínez', 'Ysrael Ortigoza', 'Alfonso Ortiz de Solórzano', 'Tamara Pardo', 'Jorge Puimedón', 'María Luisa Sarsa', 'Carmen Seoane']",13.0,17.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01542,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['High Energy Physics - Experiment', 'Instrumentation and Detectors']",,,[],2025-02-04
"V498 Hya, a new candidate for a period bouncer Cataclysmic Variable","V498 Hya (SDSS J084555.07+033929.2) was identified as a short-period cataclysmic variable (CV) by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) in 2008. The superhump period was measured during the detected single superoutburst of V498 Hya. The quiescent spectrum subsequently taken by the \SDSSV\ Milky Way Mapper survey suggested that the CV donor may be a brown dwarf. We present time-resolved follow-up spectroscopy of V498 Hya in quiescence, obtained with the GTC OSIRIS spectrograph, from which we derived the 86.053 min spectroscopic period, systemic radial velocity, and the gravitational redshift of the Mg II line. We also modeled the spectral energy distribution to constrain the system parameters, including the > 0.82 Ms mass of the white dwarf and the best-fit value 0.043 +/- 0.004 Ms of the donor star mass. This combination of parameters implies that V498 Hya has evolved past the period minimum and is a relatively rare ``period bouncer''.","['Gagik Tovmassian', 'Keith Inight', 'Anna Francesca Pala', 'Boris T.

The Effect of Foreground Galaxies on the Estimation of the Hubble Constant from Type Ia Supernovae,"Type Ia supernovae are the established `standard candle' in the construction of the Hubble diagram out to high luminosity distances. Since the Hubble constant that best fits observations of these supernovae often turns out to be high compared to fits to other data, they are currently being investigated for possible systematic effects, with many studies focusing on the calibration of the distance ladder in the local Universe. Here we present a simulation-based assessment of another type of systematic effect, related to the chance that the line of sight to a distant supernova passes close to a foreground galaxy. We consider two cases separately: First, the foreground galaxy may block the line of sight so that the supernova is not observed. Since foreground galaxies are correlated with overdensities that typically magnify the flux of background sources, this effect leads to a systematic removal of lensed supernovae from the sample, biasing the high-redshift Hubble diagram towards demagnified (fainter) supernovae. Second, if the supernova can be observed, its proximity to the foreground galaxy can lead to an incorrect host assignment, especially if the true host has a low surface brightness. Since foreground galaxies are typically found at lower redshifts, this effect introduces another systematic bias. The probability of line-of-sight alignments with foreground galaxies increases with redshift and therefore affects distant supernovae more strongly. We find that both effects are small, but the effect of host misidentification should be included in the systematic error budget at current levels of measurement precision.","['Amalia Villarrubia Aguilar', 'Julian Adamek']",10.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01602,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-04
"From pre-transit to post-eclipse: investigating the impact of 3D temperature, chemistry, and dynamics on high-resolution emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b","High-resolution spectroscopy has provided a wealth of information about the climate and composition of ultra-hot Jupiters. However, the 3D structure of their atmospheres makes observations more challenging to interpret, necessitating 3D forward-modeling studies. In this work, we model phase-dependent thermal emission spectra of the archetype ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b to understand how the line strengths and Doppler shifts of Fe, CO, H$_2$O, and OH evolve throughout the orbit. We post-process outputs of the SPARC/MITgcm global circulation model with the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT to simulate emission spectra at 36 orbital phases. We then cross-correlate the spectra with different templates to obtain CCF and $K_{\text{p}}$$-$$V_{\text{sys}}$ maps. For each species, our models produce consistently negative $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets in pre- and post-eclipse, which are driven by planet rotation. The size of these offsets is similar to the equatorial rotation velocity of the planet. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the weak vertical temperature gradient on the nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters mutes the absorption features of CO and H$_2$O, which significantly hampers their detectability in pre- and post-transit. We also show that the $K_{\text{p}}$ and $V_{\text{sys}}$ offsets in pre- and post-transit are not always a measure for the line-of-sight velocities in the atmosphere. This is because the cross-correlation signal is a blend of dayside emission and nightside absorption features. Finally, we highlight that the observational uncertainty in the known orbital velocity of ultra-hot Jupiters can be multiple km/s, which makes it hard for certain targets to meaningfully report absolute $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets.","['Joost P.

Deep Constraints on [CII]158$\mu$m in JADES-GS-z14-0: Further Evidence for a Galaxy with Low Gas Content at z=14.2,"We present deep ALMA observations targeting the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0, the most distant known galaxy at z=14.1793. We do not detect the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in our deep observations, implying a luminosity of $<$6$\times10^7$ L$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$) for the target. Comparing this with the detected [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line, we constrain the [OIII]/[CII] ratio to be $>$3.5, significantly improving our probe of the ionization parameter $U$. The observed ratio is higher than analogues in the local universe, but consistent with galaxies at $z\approx6$-9. Through ISM modeling, we infer extreme ionizing conditions with log(U)$>-$2.0, likely requiring a young stellar population. Our modeling also indicates a relatively low gas density ($51_{-32}^{+116}$ cm$^{-3}$), significantly lower than expected from lower redshift trends. We infer a relatively high gas-phase metallicity (16$\pm$6\% solar) consistent with previous results and implying a rapid build-up of metals. Finally, using [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ as a molecular/cold gas mass tracer, we infer a low gas fraction ($f_\mathrm{gas} < 0.77$), consistent with previous estimates of the dynamical mass from [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$. Combined with the low observed gas density, lack of dust and high ionization parameter, this suggests strong feedback processes are playing an important role in the evolution of this galaxy. Our observations show that JADES-GS-z14-0 is a rapidly evolving galaxy with extreme ISM conditions, shedding light on the earliest phases of galaxy formation.","['Sander Schouws', 'Rychard J.

The Irrelevance of Primordial Black Hole Clustering in the LVK mass range,"We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primordial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales.

Diverse Rotation Curves of Galaxies in a Simulated Universe: the Observed Dependence on Stellar Mass and Morphology Reproduced,"We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the rotation curves of galaxies in the local universe. To do that, we first select the galaxies with 9.4 $<$ $\log{(M_\mathrm{star}/M_\odot)}$ $<$ 11.5 to make a sample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the two-dimensional line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the rotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region ($R_\mathrm{t}<r<3\times r_\mathrm{half,*}$). The outer slopes of the simulated galaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar mass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as galaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The outer slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter fraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study demonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on morphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological simulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in shaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study could serve as an important testbed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies back in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the diverse rotation curves.","['Daeun Jeong', 'Ho Seong Hwang', 'Haeun Chung', 'Yongmin Yoon']",17.0,22.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01625,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,['Galaxy dynamics (591)'],2025-02-04
A Poisson Process AutoDecoder for X-ray Sources,"X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.","['Yanke Song', 'Victoria Ashley Villar', 'Juan Rafael Martinez-Galarza', 'Steven Dillmann']",5.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01627,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'Machine Learning', 'Applications']",,,[],2025-02-04
Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation,"We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.","['Björn Garbrecht', 'Pulkit S.

Efficient Search for Extremely Metal Poor Galaxies in the Local Universe using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Nearby extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) allow us to study primitive galaxy formation and evolution in greater detail than is possible at high redshift. This work, for the first time, promotes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently search for XMPs in multi-band imaging data based on their predicted N2 index (N2\,$\equiv\log$\{\rNii/\Ha\}). We developed a sequential characterisation pipeline, composed of three CNN procedures: (i) a classifier for metal-poor galaxies, (ii) a classifier for XMPs, and (iii) an N2 predictor. The pipeline is applied to over 7.7 million SDSS DR17 imaging data without SDSS spectroscopy. The predicted N2 values are used to select promising candidates for observations. This approach was validated by new observations of 45 candidates with redshifts less than 0.065 using the 2.54~m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the 4.1~m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope between 2023 and 2024. All 45 candidates are confirmed to be metal-poor, including 28 new discoveries. There are 18/45 galaxies lacking detectable \rNii\ lines ($S/N<2$); for these, we report $2\sigma$ upper limits on their oxygen abundance. Our XMPs have estimated oxygen abundances of $7.1\leq$\OH$\leq8.7$ ($2\sigma$ upper limit), based on the N2 index, and 21 of them with estimated metallicity $<0.1~Z_{\odot}$. Additionally, we identified 4 potential candidates of low-metallicity AGNs at $\lesssim0.1Z_{\odot}$. Finally, we found that our observed samples are mostly brighter in the $g-$band compared to other filters, similar to blueberry (BB) galaxies, resembling green pea galaxies and high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters.","['Ting-Yun Cheng', 'Ryan J.

Constraining the major merger history of $z \sim 3-9$ galaxies using JADES: dominant in-situ star formation,"We present a comprehensive analysis of galaxy close-pair fractions and major merger rates to evaluate the importance of mergers in the hierarchical growth of galaxies over cosmic time. This study focuses on the previously poorly understood redshift range of $z \approx 3-9$ using JADES observations. Our mass-complete sample includes primary galaxies with stellar masses of ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, having major companions (mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) selected by $5-30$ pkpc projected separation and redshift proximity criteria. Pair fractions are measured using a statistically robust method incorporating photometric redshift posteriors and available spectroscopic data. The pair fraction evolves steeply with redshift, peaking at $z \sim 5-6$, followed by a turnover, and shows dependence on the stellar mass: the pair fraction peaks at later cosmic times (lower redshifts) for more massive galaxies. Similarly, the derived galaxy major merger rate increases and flattens beyond $z \sim 6$ to $2-10~{\rm Gyr^{-1}}$ per galaxy, showing a weak scaling with stellar mass, driven by the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function. A comparison between the cumulative mass accretion from major mergers and the mass assembled through star formation indicates that major mergers contribute approximately $5-14\%$ to the total mass growth over the studied redshift range, which is in agreement with the ex-situ mass fraction estimated from our simple numerical model. These results highlight that major mergers contribute little to the direct stellar mass growth compared to in-situ star formation but could still play an indirect role by driving star formation itself.","['Dávid Puskás', 'Sandro Tacchella', 'Charlotte Simmonds', 'Kevin Hainline', ""Francesco D'Eugenio"", 'Stacey Alberts', 'Santiago Arribas', 'William M.

Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes,"As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($<2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu<0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline.

Cosmic quenching,"The quenching of star formation activity represents a critical phase for a non-negligible fraction of the observed galaxy population at all cosmic epochs, marking a transition from an epoch of intense mass growth to an extended period of passive evolution. Over the past years, we have collected a detailed characterization of how the fraction of quenched galaxies evolves as a function of cosmic time (it grows at later cosmic epochs), and correlates with the physical properties of galaxies (more massive galaxies, that also tend to be bulge-dominated, are more likely to be quenched) and with their environment (denser environments host larger fractions of quiescent galaxies). Different physical processes can lead to a suppression of star formation. These include internal processes (processes that do not depend on the environment in which galaxies live, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms) and processes that instead depend on the environment (e.g. mergers, gas stripping processes). In this chapter, we summarize the observational and theoretical status of the field, highlighting the most recent results and the questions that are yet to be answered.

Chaotic Behavior of Trapped Cosmic Rays,"Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic rays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The observed anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In coherent magnetic structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic mirroring can temporarily trap particles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work, we develop a new method to characterize cosmic rays' chaotic behavior in magnetic systems using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree of chaos and adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an axial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing time-dependent magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect chaotic behavior. We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can represent diverse magnetic configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our results have three key implications. (1)Theoretical: We find a correlation between the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the particle escape time from the system, which follows a power law that persists even under additional perturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system characteristics, offering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion. (2)Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic ray simulations and can influence the resulting anisotropy maps. (3)Observational: Arrival maps display areas where the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the basis for time variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework for studying the effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the heliosphere and the role of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.","['Vanessa López-Barquero', 'Paolo Desiati']",11.0,20.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01726,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Cosmic rays(329) – Galactic cosmic rays(567) – High energy astrophysics(739) – Magnetic fields(994) – Solar wind(1534) – Heliosphere(711) – Chaos 1'],2025-02-05
Pearls on a string: Dark and bright galaxies on a strikingly straight and narrow filament,"We identify a chain of galaxies along an almost straight line in the nearby Universe with a projected length of ~5 Mpc. The galaxies are distributed within projected distances of only 7-105 kpc from the axis of the identified filament. They have redshifts in a very small range of z=0.0361-0.0370 so that their radial velocities are consistent with galaxy proper motions. The filament galaxies are mainly star-forming and have stellar masses in a range of $\rm 10^{9.1}-10^{10.7}\,M_{\odot}$. We search for systems with similar geometrical properties in the full-sky mock galaxy catalogue of the MillenniumTNG simulations and find that although such straight filaments are unusual and rare, they are predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations (4% incidence). We study the cold HI gas in a 1.3 Mpc section of the filament through HI-21cm emission line observations and detect eleven HI sources, many more than expected from the HI mass function in a similar volume. They have HI masses $\rm 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and are mostly within ~120 kpc projected distance from the filament axis. None of these HI sources has a confirmed optical counterpart. Their darkness together with their large HI-21cm line-widths indicate that they contain gas that might not yet be virialized. These clouds must be marking the peaks of the dark matter and HI distributions over large scales within the filament.

Flux ratio anomalies from gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe), just like lensed quasars, can be used to constrain the stellar mass fractions at the image positions. Type Ia supernovae are of particular interest as knowledge of the intrinsic source brightness helps constrain the amount of (de)magnification from the macromodel predictions that might be due to microlensing. In addition, the presence or absence of caustic crossings in the light curves of glSNe can be used to constrain the mass of the microlenses. We find that a sample of 50 well-modeled glSNe Ia systems with single epoch observations at peak intrinsic supernova luminosity should be able to constrain a stellar mass-to-light ratio to within $\sim 15\%$. A set of systems with light curve level information providing the location (or absence) of caustic crossing events can also constrain the mass of the microlenses to within $\sim 50\%$. Much work is needed to make such a measurement in practice, but our results demonstrate the feasibility of microlensing to place constraints on astrophysical parameters related to the initial mass function of lensing galaxies without any prior assumptions on the stellar mass.","['Luke Weisenbach', 'Thomas Collett', 'Wolfgang Enzi', 'Lindsay Oldham', 'Ana Sainz de Murieta']",5.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01728,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['gravitational lensing: micro – gravitational lensing: strong – transients: supernovae 1 INTRODUCTION Preciselyhowthemattercontentofgalaxiesissplitbetweenbaryons anddarkmatterisacomplexproblem'],2025-02-05
The Dynamical History of the Kepler-221 Planet System,"Kepler-221 is a G-type star hosting four planets. In this system, planets b, c, and e are in (or near) a 6:3:1 three-body resonance even though the planets' period ratios show significant departures from exact two-body commensurability. Importantly, the intermediate planet d is not part of the resonance chain. To reach this resonance configuration, we propose a scenario in which there were originally five planets in the system in a chain of first-order resonances. After disk dispersal, the resonance chain became unstable and two planets quickly merged to become the current planet d. In addition, the b/c/e three-body resonance was re-established. We run N-body simulations using REBOUND to investigate the parameter space under which this scenario can operate. We find that our envisioned scenario is possible when certain conditions are met. First, the reformation of the three-body resonance after planet merging requires convergent migration between planets b and c. Second, as has previously pointed out, an efficient damping mechanism must operate to power the expansion of the b/c/e system. We find that planet d plays a crucial role during the orbital expansion phase due to destabilizing encounters of a three-body resonance between c, d, and e. A successful orbital expansion phase puts constraints on the planet properties in the Kepler-221 system including the planet mass ratios and the tidal quality factors for the planets. Our model can also be applied to other planet systems in resonance, such as Kepler-402 and K2-138.","['Tian Yi', 'Chris W. Ormel', 'Shuo Huang', 'Antoine C.

Can the neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 have a coronal origin?,"The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the first astrophysical source associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and it has emerged as the second-most-prominent hotspot in the neutrino sky over ten years of observations. Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been attributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a significant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced in the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in TXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario, focusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a high-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard accretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process necessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally motivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict the emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength and neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from this AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred location for neutrino production.","['Damiano F.

The radio re-brightening of the Type IIb SN 2001ig,"We study the late-time evolution of the compact Type IIb SN 2001ig in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424, with new and unpublished archival data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. More than two decades after the SN explosion, its radio luminosity is showing a substantial re-brightening: it is now two orders of magnitude brighter than expected from the standard model of a shock expanding into a uniform circumstellar wind (i.e., with a density scaling as R^{-2}). This suggests that the SN ejecta have reached a denser shell, perhaps compressed by the fast wind of the Wolf-Rayet progenitor or expelled centuries before the final stellar collapse. We model the system parameters (circumstellar density profile, shock velocity, mass loss rate), finding that the denser layer was encountered when the shock reached a distance of ~0.1 pc; the mass-loss rate of the progenitor immediately before the explosion was Mdot/v_w ~ 10^{-7} Msun/yr/(km/s). We compare SN 2001ig with other SNe that have shown late-time re-brightenings, and highlight the opposite behaviour of some extended Type IIb SNe which show instead a late-time flux cut-off.","['Roberto Soria', 'Thomas D.

The $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey. I. Survey overview and the first precise age estimate for ESO452-11 and 2MASS-GC01,"We present the $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS), a $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ treasury programme dedicated to the observation of all the kinematically confirmed Milky Way globular clusters that missed previous $Hubble$ imaging. After introducing the aims of the programme and describing its target clusters, we showcase the first results of the survey. These are related to two clusters, one located at the edge of the Milky Way Bulge and observed in optical bands, namely ESO452-11, and one located in the Galactic Disc observed in the near-IR, namely 2MASS-GC01. For both clusters, the deep colour-magnitude diagrams obtained from the MGCS observations reach several magnitudes below their main-sequence turn-off, and thus enable the first precise estimate of their age. By using the methods developed within the CARMA project, we find ESO452-11 to be an old, metal-intermediate globular cluster, with ${\rm [M/H]}\simeq-0.80^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ and an age of ${\rm t}=13.59^{+0.48}_{-0.69}$ Gyr. Its location on the age-metallicity relation makes it consistent with an in-situ origin, in agreement with its dynamical properties. On the other hand, the results for 2MASS-GC01 highlight it as a young, metal-intermediate cluster, with an age of ${\rm t}=7.22^{+0.93}_{-1.11}$ Gyr at ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.73^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. This is the first ever age estimate for this extremely extincted cluster, and indicates it either as the youngest globular known to date, or as a massive and compact open cluster, which is consistent with its almost circular, disc-like orbit.","['D.

Constraining the geometry of the gas surrounding a typical galaxy at $z = 3.4$ with Ly$\alpha$ polarization,"Ly$\alpha$ emission is the strongest tracer of recombining ionized hydrogen in young, star-forming galaxies, but its origin is still debated. Ly$\alpha$ arises when emitted photons scatter in neutral hydrogen and, so far, observational efforts have mostly focused on the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness and spectral profile, which depend on the neutral hydrogen column density, geometry, kinematics, powering mechanism and on the region from which the photons are emitted. Different processes produce similar spectra, but have different degrees of polarization, that we can use to discriminate between them. In this paper, we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 3.4$, strongly lensed by the cluster of galaxies Abell 2895, taken with the PMOS mode of the VLT/FORS2 instrument. We measure a Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization $1\sigma$ upper limit of $4.6\%$. We develop new Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer models to reproduce the observations, that can be explained by assuming the star-forming galaxy being embedded in a CGM with a biconical outflow geometry, with an opening angle of the wind $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 30^\circ$ for line-of-sight angles $\theta_{LOS} \leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 45^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 60^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, and $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 75^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 40^\circ$, where $\theta_{LOS}=0^\circ$ means observing in the direction of the outflow. We notice that the constraints from polarization are complementary to those from the spectral line profile. This study shows the potential of adding measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization to constrain the geometry of the gas surrounding typical star-forming galaxies and paves the way to spatially resolved studies that will allow us to disentangle between different Ly$\alpha$ origin mechanisms.","['A.

JWST sighting of decameter main-belt asteroids and view on meteorite sources,"Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth, including the more frequent megaton explosions from decameter impactors. While large asteroids ($\geq$100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution--which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth--varies significantly among models. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids ($\gtrapprox $10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST's infrared capabilities covering the asteroids' emission peaks and synthetic tracking techniques. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects' distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ${\sim}100$ m (debiased cumulative slopes of $q = -2.66\pm0.60$ and $-0.97\pm0.14$ for diameters smaller and larger than $\sim $100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families--most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia--according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families and the source regions of meteorites ""in-situ"".","['Artem Y.

"$Lux$: A generative, multi-output, latent-variable model for astronomical data with noisy labels","The large volume of spectroscopic data available now and from near-future surveys will enable high-dimensional measurements of stellar parameters and properties. Current methods for determining stellar labels from spectra use physics-driven models, which are computationally expensive and have limitations in their accuracy due to simplifications. While machine learning methods provide efficient paths toward emulating physics-based pipelines, they often do not properly account for uncertainties and have complex model structure, both of which can lead to biases and inaccurate label inference. Here we present $Lux$: a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra and labels that addresses prior limitations. $Lux$ is a generative, multi-output, latent variable model framework built on JAX for computational efficiency and flexibility. As a generative model, $Lux$ properly accounts for uncertainties and missing data in the input stellar labels and spectral data and can either be used in probabilistic or discriminative settings. Here, we present several examples of how $Lux$ can successfully emulate methods for precise stellar label determinations for stars ranging in stellar type and signal-to-noise from the $APOGEE$ surveys. We also show how a simple $Lux$ model is successful at performing label transfer between the $APOGEE$ and $GALAH$ surveys. $Lux$ is a powerful new framework for the analysis of large-scale spectroscopic survey data. Its ability to handle uncertainties while maintaining high precision makes it particularly valuable for stellar survey label inference and cross-survey analysis, and the flexible model structure allows for easy extension to other data types.","['Danny Horta', 'Adrian M.

Resolving the Super-Earth/Gas Giant Connection in Stellar Mass and Metallicity,"The observed correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants places strong constraints on formation theories. Building on previous work, Bryan $\&$ Lee 2024 showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between super-Earths and outer gas giants around metal-rich FGK stars, and that this correlation disappears for metal-poor hosts. Here we consider how this connection evolves across stellar mass. Starting with our sample of 85 M-dwarfs ($<$0.6 M$_{\odot}$) hosting inner super-Earths, we calculate P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$>$0) = 9.4 (+10.2 -3.1)$\%$ and P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0)$<$3.1$\%$. Compared to the field gas giant frequency calculated from the Rosenthal et al 2021 sample, we find P(GG|[Fe/H]$>$0) = 10.3 (+6.9 -3.1)$\%$, and P(GG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0)$<$2.6$\%$ for M-dwarfs. While we see a higher gas giant frequency around metal-rich M-dwarfs for both samples, we find no significant correlations between super-Earths and gas giants. Combining our 85 M-dwarf sample with our FGK sample from Bryan $\&$ Lee 2024, we resolve the SE/GG correlation in stellar mass (0.3--1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and metallicity. We show the positive correlation emerges in metal-rich K-dwarfs and strengthens with increasing stellar mass. Gas giant properties also impact the correlation -- for metal rich stars, the positive correlation is strengthened by: 1) dynamically hot gas giants for all stellar masses; 2) distant gas giants only for higher mass stars; and 3) single gas giants for K-dwarfs and multiple gas giants around more massive stars. We discuss how the stellar mass dependence of the inner-outer planet correlation can be understood from the increasing disk mass budget for higher mass stars.","['Marta L. Bryan', 'Eve J.

Clustered unified dark sector cosmology: Background evolution and linear perturbations in light of observations,"We consider unified dark sector models in which the fluid can collapse and cluster into halos, allowing for hierarchical structure formation to proceed as in standard cosmology. We show that both background evolution and linear perturbations tend towards those in $\LCDM$ as the clustered fraction $f \rightarrow 1$. We confront such models with various observational datasets, with emphasis on the relatively well motivated standard Chaplygin gas. We show that the strongest constraints come from secondary anisotropies in the CMB spectrum, which prefer models with $f \rightarrow 1$. However, as a larger Hubble constant is allowed for smaller $f$, values of $f \simeq 0.99$ (rather than tending to exact unity) are favored when late universe expansion data is included, with $f \simeq 0.97$ and $H_0 \simeq 70 {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ allowed at the 2-$\sigma$ level. Such values of $f$ imply extremely efficient clustering into nonlinear structures. They may nevertheless be compatible with clustered fractions in warm dark matter based cosmologies, which have similar minimal halo mass scales as the models considered here. Tight CMB constraints on $f$ also apply to the generalized Chaplygin gas, except for models that are already quite close to $\LCDM$, in which case all values of $0 \le f \le 1$ are allowed. In contrast to the CMB, large scale structure data, which were initially used to rule out unclustered unified dark matter models, are far less constraining. Indeed, late universe data, including the large scale galaxy distribution, prefer models that are far from $\LCDM$. But these are in tension with the CMB data.","['Mahmoud Hashim', 'Amr El-Zant']",16.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01751,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-05
Polydisperse Formation of Planetesimals: The dust size distribution in clumps,"The streaming instability is an efficient method for overcoming the barriers to planet formation in protoplanetary discs. The streaming instability has been extensively modelled by hydrodynamic simulations of gas and a single dust size. However, more recent studies considering a more realistic case of a particle size distribution show that this will significantly decrease the growth rate of the instability. We follow up on these studies by evaluating the polydisperse streaming instability, looking at the non-linear phase of the instability at the highest density regions, and investigating the dust size distribution in the densest dust structures. We employ 2D hydrodynamic simulations in an unstratified shearing box with multiple dust species representing an underlying continuous dust size spectrum using FARGO3D. To calculate the drag force on the gas due to a continuous dust size distribution, we apply the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method in dust size space. This method converges faster with the number of dust species than the usual uniform sampling method. The polydisperse streaming instability is less efficient than its monodisperse counterpart in generating dense clumps that could collapse into planetesimals. In the densest dust structure, the larger dust sizes are more abundant because they are less coupled to the gas and, therefore, can clump together more than the smaller dust grains. This trend is broken at the largest dust size due to size-dependent spatial segregation of the highest-density regions, where particles with the largest Stokes numbers are located just outside the densest areas of the combined dust species. This is observed as a peak in the size distribution at the densest regions, which could relate to the size distribution that ends up in the planetesimal after collapse and can mimic the size distribution of dust growth.","['Jip Matthijsse', 'Hossam Aly', 'Sijme-Jan Paardekooper']",19.0,16.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01752,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics – instabilities – methods: numerical – planets and satellites: formation – protoplanetary disc 1'],2025-02-05
Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons,"We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.","['Eliot Quataert', 'Philip F.

Tracking the Chemical Evolution of Hydrocarbons Through Carbon Grain Supply in Protoplanetary Disks,"The gas present in planet-forming disks typically exhibits strong emission features of abundant carbon and oxygen molecular carriers. In some instances, protoplanetary disks show an elevated C/O ratio above interstellar values, which leads to a rich hydrocarbon chemistry evidenced in the mid-infrared spectra. The origin of this strengthened C/O ratio may stem from the release of less complex hydrocarbons from the chemical processing of carbonaceous grains. We have explored a set of 42 single-cell models in which we match the physical conditions to the inner regions of planet-forming disks, while varying the C/O ratio by exploring different levels of CH$_4$, C, H$_2$O, and CO to the gas-phase chemistry, which we evaluate in both the cosmic/X-ray and UV-driven limit. We find that the carbon-bearing species in our models exhibit high dependencies on the driver of the chemistry, where both CO and long chain hydrocarbons act as carbon sinks in the cosmic/X-ray-driven chemistry limit, while the vast majority ends up in atomic carbon and CO in the UV-driven limit. We also find moderate dependencies upon the C/O ratio, where this and the ionization rate/UV field determines the point of peak production of a species as well as its equilibrium abundance. We also find that the production of several hydrocarbons, specifically C$_2$H$_2$, is strongly dependent up to an order of magnitude on the initial water abundance. We lastly find that in the X-ray-driven limit, both CH$_4$ and C serve as highly transient donor species to the carbon chemistry.","['Eshan Raul', 'Felipe Alarcón', 'Edwin A.

Coronal energy release by MHD avalanches III. Identification of a reconnection outflow from a nanoflare,"Outflows perpendicular to the guide field are believed to be a possible signature of magnetic reconnection in the solar corona and specifically a way to detect the occurrence of ubiquitous small-angle magnetic reconnection. The aim of this work is to identify possible diagnostic techniques of such outflows in hot coronal loops with SDO/AIA and the forthcoming MUltislit Solar Explorer (MUSE), in a realistically dynamic coronal loop environment in which an MHD avalanche is occurring. We consider a 3D MHD model of two magnetic flux tubes, including a stratified, radiative and thermal-conducting atmosphere, twisted by footpoint rotation. The faster rotating flux tube becomes kink-unstable and soon involves the other one in the avalanche. The turbulent decay of this magnetic structure on a global scale leads to the formation, fragmentation, and dissipation of current sheets driving impulsive heating akin to a nanoflare storm. We captured a clear outflow from a reconnection episode soon after the initial avalanche and synthesized its emission as detectable with AIA and MUSE. The outflow has a maximum temperature around 8 MK, a total energy of 1024 erg, a velocity of a few hundred km/s, and a duration of less than 1 min. We show the emission in the AIA 94 A channel (Fe XVIII line) and in the MUSE 108 A Fe XIX spectral line. his outflow shares many features with nanojets recently detected at lower temperatures. Its low emission measure makes, however, its detection difficult with AIA, but Doppler shifts can be measured with MUSE. Conditions become different in a later steady state phase when the flux tubes are filled with denser and relatively cooler plasma.","['G. Cozzo', 'P. Pagano', 'F. Reale', 'P. Testa', 'A.

Impact of phase signal formulations on tilt-to-length coupling noise in the LISA test mass interferometer,"Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can generate spurious displacement noise that potentially affects the measurement of gravitational wave signals. In each test mass interferometer, the coupling of misalignments with spacecraft angular jitter produces noise in the longitudinal pathlength signal. This signal comes from the phase readout combinations of an interfering measurement beam and a local reference beam at a quadrant photodetector, but various formulations exist for its calculation. Selection of this pathlength signal formulation affects the TTL coupling noise. We therefore simulated two pathlength signal candidates, the complex sum and the averaged phase, and evaluated their performance in the LISA test mass interferometer under the assumption of static alignment imperfections. All simulations were performed using three different methods with cross-checked results. We find with all three methods that the averaged phase is the choice with equal or less TTL coupling noise in four out of the five test cases. Finally, we show that the non-linear TTL contributions in the test mass interferometer to be negligible in all our test-cases, no matter which formulation of pathlength signal is chosen.","['Paul Edwards', 'Megha Dave', 'Alexander Weaver', 'Mengyuan Zhao', 'Paul Fulda', 'Guido Mueller', 'Gudrun Wanner']",25.0,34.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01808,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,"['pathlength signal', 'gravitational waves', ': tilt-to-length coupling', 'space interferometer', 'LISA instrumentationarXiv:2502', 'laser interferometry']",2025-02-05
Direct imaging of AGN outflows and their origin with the 23 m Large Binocular Telescope,"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 $\mu$m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 {have an effective resolution of $47\times90$ mas ($3.3\times6.2$ pc)} in a 5"" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck ($>15$ pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI.

Central Cluster Galaxies: A Hotspot for Detectable Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers,"We model continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), using the ASTRID cosmological simulation. The most detectable single sources are in the low-frequency bins and are produced by the most supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers (with M_BH ~ 10^10 - 10^11 solarmass) in the most massive galaxies M_star ~ 10^12 solarmass. Remarkably, these mergers (mostly at z< 0.3) occur within massive galaxies residing at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, where two subsequent mergers in the same cluster core generate high-detection-probability CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We expect electromagnetic signatures from these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and massive host galaxies that are undergoing significant star formation. We establish a novel connection between these high-mass, central cluster mergers, occurring in galaxies with active star formation and AGN, and the formation process of the central cluster galaxy in ASTRID. This provides new insights into the low-frequency gravitational wave sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.","['Yihao Zhou', 'Tiziana Di Matteo', 'Nianyi Chen', 'Luke Zoltan Kelley', 'Laura Blecha', 'Yueying Ni', 'Simeon Bird', 'Yanhui Yang', 'Rupert Croft']",5.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01845,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-02-05
Technical description and performance of the phase II version of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer,"The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) is a series of upgrades for the Keck II Adaptive Optics (AO) system and the NIRSPEC spectrograph to enable diffraction limited, high resolution (R>30000) spectroscopy of exoplanets and low mass companions in the K and L bands. Phase I consisted of single mode fiber injection/extraction units (FIU/FEU) used in conjunction with a H band pyramid wavefront sensor. The use of single mode fibers provides a gain in stellar rejection, a substantial reduction in sky background, and an extremely stable line spread function in the spectrograph. Phase II, deployed and commissioned in 2022, brought a 1000 actuator deformable mirror, beam shaping optics, a vortex mask, and other upgrades to the FIU/FEU. An additional service mission in 2024 extended operations down to y band, delivered an atmospheric dispersion corrector, and provided access to two laser frequency combs. KPIC phase II brings higher planet throughput, lower stellar leakage and many new observing modes which extend its ability to characterize exoplanets at high spectral resolution, building on the success of phase I. In this paper we present a description of the final phase II version of KPIC, along with results of system level laboratory testing and characterization showing the instrument's phase II throughput, stability, repeatability, and other key performance metrics prior to delivery and during installation at Keck. We outlined the capabilities of the various observing modes enabled by the new modules as well as efforts to compensate for static aberrations and non common path errors at Keck, which were issues that plagued phase I. Finally, we show results from commissioning.","['Nemanja Jovanovic', 'Daniel Echeverri', 'Jacques-Robert Delorme', 'Luke Finnerty', 'Tobias Schofield', 'Jason J. Wang', 'Yinzi Xin', 'Jerry Xuan', 'J.

ADF22-WEB: ALMA and JWST (sub)kpc-scale views of dusty star-forming galaxies in a $z\approx$3 proto-cluster,"We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the cosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm images are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5"" to 0.05"" (350 pc at z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures traced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset ridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and NIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15""). The Sersic index measured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity, suggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core components. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range between nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks in these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and F200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely reflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores, indicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The predominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the proto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate the highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we are witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as massive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic web gas filaments.","['Hideki Umehata', 'Mariko Kubo', 'Ian Smail', 'Bret D.

The Stationary Point: A New Method for Solar Wind Speed Measurements from a Moving Vantage Point,"The WISPR imager on Parker Solar Probe provides a unique view the young solar wind, flying through solar wind structures at high speed. It is of interest to use WISPR image sequences to measure the velocity of both large features (such as CMEs) and the background, ambient wind. However, WISPR's close-up, rapidly-moving perspective makes the usual methods for measuring velocities from images difficult or impossible to apply, as most apparent motion through the image is due to the motion or rotation of the imager. In this work, we propose a new method of looking for features at the ""stationary point"" -- a direction from which some plasma parcels appear to approach the spacecraft, remaining at a constant direction in the image sequence. This direction is a function of the plasma's radial velocity, the encounter geometry, and the spacecraft velocity, allowing the former two to be inferred. We demonstrate the technique with forward-modeled images, and we apply it to WISPR observations, inferring the speed and trajectory of a particular density feature. This method promises to enable speed measurements of the young solar wind in an important acceleration region, from a close-up perspective and at latitudes well outside the PSP orbital plane. And while we present this method in a solar wind context, it is broadly applicable to any situation of a moving viewpoint traveling through an expanding cloud of features.","['Samuel J.

Spectra of He isotopes and the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio,"Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species, $e^{\pm}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei (H-Si, S, Fe), which have resulted in a number of breakthroughs. Besides elemental spectra, AMS-02 also measures the spectra of light isotopes albeit within a smaller rigidity range. In this paper, we use the precise measurements of He isotopes and the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio by AMS-02, together with Voyager 1 data, and investigate their origin. We show that there is an excess in $^3$He at higher energies compared to standard calculations assuming its fully secondary origin, which may indicate a source of primary $^3$He, or signify a change in the propagation parameters over the Galactic volume probed by the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio. We provide updated local interstellar spectra (LIS) of $^3$He and $^4$He in the rigidity range from 2-40 GV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GalProp-HelMod framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR $e^{-}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei $Z\le28$.","['M. J. Boschini', 'S.

Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing',"In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas} = 0-100\%$). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\Phi_{\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\approx 5$ kpc and $\vert z\vert \approx 1$ kpc within $\Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}$, where $R_{\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\vert z\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.","['Joss Bland-Hawthorn', 'Thor Tepper-Garcia', 'Oscar Agertz', 'Christoph Federrath', 'Misha Haywood', 'Paola di Matteo', 'Timothy R Bedding', 'Takafumi Tsukui', 'Emily Wisnioski', 'Melissa Ness', 'Ken Freeman']",16.0,27.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01895,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: high-redshift'],2025-02-05
Testing the wavelength dependence of oscillations and granulation in red giants using Kepler and TESS,"Stellar oscillations and granulation in red giants are both powered by convection. Studying the wavelength dependence of their amplitudes can provide useful insights on the driving mechanism. It is also important for plans to carry out asteroseismology with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will operate in the near infrared, to check the dependence of oscillations and granulation on the observational wavelength. In this work, we aim to understand how the oscillation and granulation power in red giants depend on the wavelength and study how existing predictions compare with observations. We measure the mean oscillation and granulation power of 279 Kepler red giants, from the power density spectra derived using Kepler PDCSAP and TESS-SPOC light curves. We find that selection of light curves is important for the study of amplitudes, since different light curve products from TESS show different values of amplitudes. We show that the oscillation and granulation power ratios between TESS and Kepler match the theoretical prediction, confirming that both decrease as we move to redder wavelengths. We also see that the mean ratios of oscillations and granulation agree, suggesting that oscillation and granulation have the same wavelength dependence. We also find that the mean height-to-background ratio for Kepler agrees with previous results and shows good agreement with TESS. These results suggest that the granulation signals would not severely affect the detection of oscillations. We checked the dependence of these ratio between Kepler and TESS on stellar parameters, and see no trends.","['K. R. Sreenivas', 'Timothy R. Bedding', 'Daniel Huber', 'Courtney L.

"Amplifying Resonant Repulsion with Inflated Young Planets, Overlooked Inner Planets, and Non-zero Initial $\Delta$","Most multi-planet systems around mature ($\sim 5$-Gyr-old) host stars are non-resonant. Even the near-resonant planet pairs still display 1-2\% positive deviation from perfect period commensurabilities ($\Delta$) near first-order mean motion resonances (MMR). Resonant repulsion due to eccentricity tides was one of the first mechanisms proposed to explain the observed positive $\Delta$. However, the inferred rates of tidal dissipation are often implausibly rapid (with a reduced tidal quality factor $Q_p^\prime \lesssim 10$). In this work, we attempt to amplify eccentricity tides with three previously ignored effects. 1) Planets tend to be inflated when they were younger. 2) Kepler-like Planets likely form as resonant chains parked at the disk inner edge, overlooked inner planets could have contributed to tidal dissipation of the whole system. 3) Disk migration captures planets into first-order MMR with non-zero initial deviation $\Delta$, thereby lowering the amount of dissipation needed. We show that even after accounting for all three effects, $Q_p^\prime$ can only be amplified by about one order of magnitude, and still falls short of $Q_p^\prime$ values of Solar System planets. Therefore, eccentricity tides alone cannot fully explain the observed $\Delta$ distribution. Other effects such as obliquity tides, planetesimal scattering, expanding disk inner edge, disk turbulence, divergent encounters, and dynamical instabilities must have contributed to dislodging planets from first-order MMR.","['Yuancheng Xu', 'Fei Dai']",5.0,10.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01903,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-05
Half a Million M Dwarf Stars Characterized Using Domain-Adapted Spectral Analysis,"We present fundamental atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) and metallicities ([M/H]) for 507,513 M dwarf stars using low-resolution spectra (R~1800) from LAMOST DR10. By employing Cycle-StarNet, an innovative domain adaptation approach, we successfully bridge the gap between theoretical PHOENIX synthetic spectra and observed LAMOST spectra, enabling parameter measurements even for lower signal-to-noise data (S/N>5). The fitting residual analysis shows a reduction from 2.0 times to 1.68 times the flux uncertainty. Comparing with available literature values, we find systematic offsets and precisions of 12$\pm$70 K in Teff, -0.04$\pm$0.17 dex in log g, and -0.06$\pm$0.20 dex in [M/H]. The precision improves for higher quality spectra (S/N>50) to 47 K, 0.12 dex, and 0.14 dex respectively. The metallicity consistency between wide binaries shows a scatter of 0.24 dex, improving to 0.15 dex at S/N>50.

A Dual Active Black Hole Candidate with Mass Ratio ~7:1 in a Disk Galaxy,"Dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with comparable masses are commonly witnessed among the major merged galaxies with interaction remnants. Considering almost every massive galaxy is associated with multiple dwarf satellites around it, minor mergers involving galaxies with disproportional stellar masses should be much more common than major mergers, which would naturally lead to black hole (BH) pairs with significantly different masses. However, dual AGNs generated by minor mergers involving one or two dwarf galaxies are exceptionally rare and understudied. Moreover, good estimates of the masses of both BHs are not yet available to test this idea. Here we report the evidence of a dual AGN candidate with mass ratio $\sim$7:1 located in an undisturbed disk galaxy. We identify the central BH with mass of $9.4 \times 10^6M_\odot$ from its radio emission as well as AGN-driven galactic-scale biconical outflows. The off-centered BH generates obvious broad and narrow emission-line regions, which gives us a robust estimation of a $1.3 \times 10^6M_\odot$ BH mass. We explore alternative scenarios for explaining the observational features of this system, including the complex gas kinematics triggered by central AGN activity and dust attenuation of the broad-line region of the central BH, finding that they failed to fully account for the kinematics of both the redshifted off-centered broad and narrow emission-line components.","['Xiao Cao', 'Yan-Mei Chen', 'Yong Shi', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Zhi-Jie Zhou', 'Min Bao', 'Qiusheng Gu', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'Luis C.

This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazers, providing insights into their multifrequency variability.

Collisionless shocks having relativistic velocities in relativistically hot plasmas,"Shocks in relativistically hot plasmas are thought to exist in various high-energy astrophysical phenomena, but it is not clear how relativistic collisionless shocks are formed, whether particles are accelerated by the shock as in the case of cold upstream. In this work, collisionless shocks with a relativistic shock velocity in relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas are investigated by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the upstream flow is dissipated by the Weibel instability, so that the relativistic collisionless shock is formed as in the case of cold upstream. The density and magnetic field structures around the shock front are almost independent of the upstream temperature when the spatial scale is normalized by the inertial length scale which takes into account the relativistic temperature. This can be understood by considering the pressure anisotropy, which asymptotically approaches a finite value due to the relativistic beaming effect, even as the temperature becomes relativistically hotter and hotter. In addition, as long as the shock velocity is relativistic, some particles are accelerated, forming a power-law energy spectrum similar to that in the cold upstream.","['Kamiido Kazuki', 'Ohira Yutaka']",6.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01948,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['High energy astrophysics (739)'],2025-02-05
A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos and first constraints on the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction with IceCube,"We present a search for the diffuse extremely-high-energy neutrino flux using $12.6$ years of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies well above $10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $10^{18} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to a level of $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. Using this data, we constrain the proton fraction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) above $\simeq 30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\,$% (at $90\,$% CL) if the cosmological evolution of the sources is comparable to or stronger than the star formation rate. This result complements direct air-shower measurements by being insensitive to uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models. It is the first such result to disfavor the ``proton-only"" hypothesis for UHECRs using neutrino data.","['IceCube Collaboration', 'R. Abbasi', 'M. Ackermann', 'J. Adams', 'S. K. Agarwalla', 'J. A.

Resolved Stellar Mass Estimation of Nearby Late-type Galaxies for the SPHEREx Era: Dependence on Stellar Population Synthesis Models,"The upcoming all-sky infrared spectrophotometric SPHEREx mission is set to provide spatially resolved stellar mass maps of nearby galaxies, offering more detailed insights than integrated light observations. In this study, we develop a strategy for estimating stellar mass using SPHEREx by examining the dependence on different stellar population synthesis (SPS) models and proposing new scaling relations based on simulated SPHEREx data. We estimate the resolved stellar masses of 19 nearby late-type galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, treating these as fiducial masses. By testing four SPS models covering infrared wavelengths, i.e., E-MILES, Bruzual \& Charlot 2003 (BC03), Charlot \& Bruzual 2019 (CB19), and FSPS, we find systematic differences in mass-to-light ratios at $3.6~{\rm \mu m}$ ($M_{\ast}/L_{\rm 3.6\mu m}$) among the SPS models. In particular, BC03 and CB19 yield mass-to-light ratios on average $\sim0.2-0.3~{\rm dex}$ lower than those from E-MILES and FSPS. These mass-to-light ratios strongly correlate with stellar age, indicating a significant impact of young stellar populations on stellar mass measurements. Our analysis, incorporating fiducial masses and simulated SPHEREx data, identifies the $1.6~{\rm \mu m}$ band as the optimal wavelength for stellar mass estimation, with the lowest scatter ($0.15-0.20~{\rm dex}$) of the stellar mass. This scatter can be further reduced to $0.10-0.12~{\rm dex}$ across all SPS models by incorporating optical and SPHEREx colors. These results can provide guidance for measuring the stellar masses of the numerous nearby galaxies that SPHEREx will survey.","['Jeong Hwan Lee', 'Minjin Kim', 'Taehyun Kim', 'Hyunjin Shim', 'Luis C.

Thirty-five years of timing of M53A with Arecibo and FAST,"PSR B1310+18A is a 33-ms binary pulsar in a 256-day, low eccentricity orbit with a low-mass companion located in NGC 5024 (M53). In this Letter, we present the first phase-coherent timing solution for this pulsar (designated as M53A) derived from a 35-year timing baseline; this combines the archival Arecibo Observatory data with the recent observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find that the spin period derivative of the pulsar is between 6.1 and $7.5 \times 10^{-19} \rm \, s\, s^{-1}$, which implies a characteristic age between 0.70 and 0.85 Gyr. The timing solution also includes a precise position and proper motion for the pulsar, enabling the identification of the companion of M53A in Hubble Space Telescope data as a Helium white dwarf (He WD) with a mass of $M_{\rm WD}=0.39^{+0.05}_{-0.07} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and a cooling age of $0.14^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\, \rm Gyr$, confirming that the system formed recently in the history of the GC. The system resembles, in its spin and orbital characteristics, similarly wide pulsar - He WD systems in the Galactic disk.

Self-consistent scenario for jet and stellar explosion in collapsar: General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with dynamo,"A resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation with a dynamo term is performed for modeling the collapsar in full general relativity. As an initial condition, a spinning black hole and infalling stellar matter are modeled based on a stellar evolution result, superimposing a weak toroidal magnetic field. After the growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is amplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In an early stage of the torus growth, magnetic fluxes that fall to the vicinity of the central black hole are swallowed by the black hole and global poloidal magnetic fields that can be the source of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are not developed. However, in a later stage in which the ram pressure of the infalling matter becomes weak, the magnetic field amplified by the black hole spin via the winding becomes large enough to expel the infalling matter by the magnetic pressure, and subsequently, a global poloidal magnetic field that penetrates the black hole is established, launching a jet along the spin axis by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism with the luminosity suitable for explaining typical long gamma-ray bursts. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous effect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive the stellar explosion with the explosion energy comparable to typical or powerful supernovae. We also find large amounts of synthesized $^{56}$Ni and Zn associated with the stellar explosion. In the presence of jet launching, $r$-process elements are weakly synthesized. The numerical results of the explosion energy, ejecta mass, and $^{56}$Ni mass are in a good agreement with those for observed broad-lined type Ic supernovae. Our result illustrates a self-consistent scenario for the gamma-ray-burst-associated broad-lined type Ic supernovae.","['Masaru Shibata', 'Sho Fujibayashi', 'Shinya Wanajo', 'Kunihito Ioka', 'Alan Tsz-Lok Lam', 'Yuichiro Sekiguchi']",13.0,22.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02077,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-02-05
First spectro-polarimetric study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+1,"We present the first spectro-polarimetric study of the bright atoll source GX 9+1, using the simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations. The source was observed to remain in the soft state, with no changes in state throughout the observation period. The source does not show significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. However, a significant polarization (3.3 sigma) was detected in the 2-3 keV range, with a polarization degree of 3.3 +/- 0.8% and a polarization angle of 11 +/- 7 deg. We used the simultaneous energy spectra from NICER (0.6 - 11 keV) and IXPE (2-8 keV) to study the spectral properties of the source during observations. The observed spectrum of the source can be well described by a combination of Comptonized blackbody emission from the neutron star surface (compbb model in XSPEC) and thermal Comptonized component with seed photons from the accretion disc. The spectral properties of GX 9+1 during the observation are consistent with those of other bright atoll-sources in the soft state. However, the high polarization degree observed in the low-energy band does not align with previous IXPE observations of other atoll-sources. This observed polarization in the source is attributed to the strong polarization of the Comptonized blackbody component. We discuss the results from the spectro-polarimetric studies in the context of various accretion disc and coronal geometries of the source.","['V. P. Shyam Prakash', 'Vivek K. Agrawal', 'A. M.

Insight into the physical processes that shape the metallicity profiles in galaxies,"The distribution of chemical elements in the star-forming regions can store information on the chemical enrichment history of the galaxies. Negative metallicity gradients are expected in galaxies forming inside-out. However, observations show that the metallicity profiles can be broken. We aim to study the diversity of metallicity profiles that can arise in the current cosmological context and compare them with available observations. We also seek to identify the physical processes responsible for breaks in metallicity profiles by using two galaxies as case studies. We analyze central galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the CIELO project, within the stellar mass range [$10^{8.5}$, $10^{10.5}$] M$_\odot$ at $z=0$. A new algorithm, DB-A, was developed to fit multiple power laws to the metallicity profiles, enabling a flexible assessment of metallicity gradients in various galactic regions. The simulations include detailed modeling of gas, metal-dependent cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. At $z=0$, we find diverse profile shapes, including inner and outer drops and rises, with some galaxies exhibiting double breaks. Gradient values align with observations. A temporal analysis of Local Group analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with outer breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability at high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner breaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star formation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven outflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material, extended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at high redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows. We highlight the complex interplay of these processes which often act together.","['Brian Tapia-Contreras', 'Patricia B.

From Streaming Instability to the Onset of Pebble Accretion I. Investigating the Growth Modes in Planetesimal Rings,"Context. The localized formation of planetesimals can be triggered with the help of streaming instability when the local pebble density is high. This can happen at various locations in the disk leading to the formation of local planetesimal rings. The planetesimals in these rings subsequently grow from mutual collisions and by pebble accretion. Aims. We investigate the early growth of protoplanetary embryos from a ring of planetesimals created from streaming instability to see if they reach sizes where they accrete pebbles efficiently. Methods. We simulate the early stages of planet formation for rings of planetesimals that we assume were created by streaming instability at various separations from the star and for various stellar masses using a semi-analytic model. Results. The rings in the inner disk are able to produce protoplanetary embryos in a short time whereas at large separations there is little to no growth. The growth of the largest bodies is significantly slower around lower-mass stars. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos from filaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the separation from the star and the mass of the host star. It remains difficult to form the seeds of pebble accretion early in the outer disk \sim 50AU, especially for low-mass stars.","['Nicolas Kaufmann', 'Octavio M. Guilera', 'Yann Alibert', 'Irina L.

Discovery of an RRAT-like pulsar via its single pulses in an MWA imaging survey,"We report the discovery of PSR J0031$-$5726 in the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA eXtended imaging survey at a Galactic latitude of $b \approx -60^\circ$. The pulsar exhibits both sporadic, extremely bright pulses reminiscent of rotating radio transients (RRATs) as well as a persistent, dimmer pulses. The bright pulses tend to arrive at later rotation phases than their dimmer counterparts, and have dramatically varying polarization angle curves, such that the integrated profile appears almost completely depolarized down to the system noise level. The rotation measure of individual pulses was found to sometimes vary by up to ${\sim}0.8\,$rad/m$^2$, but was otherwise generally consistent with its average (ionosphere-corrected) value of $10.0 \pm 0.1\,$rad/m$^2$. We surmise that J0031$-$5726 may represent a class of pulsar that is intermediate between normal pulsars and RRATs.","['Samuel J.

Dust supply to slose binary systems,"Context. Binary systems can be born surrounded by circumbinary discs. The gaseous discs surrounding either of the two stellar companions can have their life extended by the supply of mass arriving from the circumbinary disc. Aims. The objective of this study is to investigate the gravitational interactions exerted by a compact and eccentric binary system on the circumbinary and circumprimary discs, and the resulting transport of gas and solids between the disc components. Methods. We assume that the gas in the system behaves as a fluid and model its evolution by means of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Dust grains are modeled as Lagrangian particles that interact with the gas and the stars. Results. Models indicate that significant fluxes of gas and dust proceed from the circumbinary disc toward the circumprimary disc. For the applied system parameters, grains of certain sizes are segregated outside the tidal gap generated by the stars. Consequently, the size distribution of the transported dust is not continuous but it presents a gap in the mm size range. In close binaries, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disc is found to be short, approximately 10 5 years, because of its small mass. However, because of the influx of gas from beyond the tidal gap, the disc around the primary star can survive much longer, about 10 6 years, as long as gas accretion from the circumbinary disc continues. The supply of solids and the extended lifetime of a circumbinary disc also aids in the possible formation of giant planets. Compared to close binary systems without a circumbinary disc, we expect a higher frequency of single- or multiple- planet systems. Additionally, a planetesimal or debris belt can form in proximity of the truncation radius of the circumprimary disc and/or around the location of the exterior edge of the tidal gap.","['Francesco Marzari', ""Gennaro D'Angelo""]",7.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02134,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['Accretion', 'accretion disks – Methods: numerical – Protoplanetary disks – Stars: binaries: close 1']",2025-02-05
Spatial distribution and clustering properties of the young stellar populations in the Carina Nebula complex and Car OB1,"We use Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to analyze the spatial distribution of the young stellar populations and stellar clusters and to search for new OB star candidates in the Carina Nebula complex and the full extent of the Car OB1 association. We first performed a new census of high-mass stars in Car OB1 and compiled a comprehensive catalog of 517 stars with known spectral types that have Gaia DR3 parallaxes consistent with membership in the association. We applied the clustering algorithm DBSCAN on the Gaia data of the region to find stellar clusters, determine their distances and kinematics, and estimate ages. We also used Gaia astrometry and the additional astrophysical_parameters table to perform a spatially unbiased search for further high-mass members of Car OB1 over the full area of the association. Our DBSCAN analysis finds 15 stellar clusters and groups in Car OB1, four of which were not known before. Most clusters (80%) show signs of expansion or contraction, four of them with a >2$\sigma$ significance. We find a global expansion of the Car OB1 association and a kinematic traceback of the high-mass stars shows that the spatial extent of the association was at a minimum 3-4 Myr ago. Using astrophysical parameters by Gaia DR3, we identified 15 new O-type and 589 new B-type star candidates in Car OB1. The majority (>54%) of the high-mass stars constitute a non-clustered distributed stellar population. Based on our sample of high-mass stars, we estimate a total stellar population of at least ~8*10^4 stars in Car OB1. Our study is the first systematic astrometric analysis that covers the full spatial extent of the Car OB1 association, and it therefore substantially increases the knowledge of the distributed stellar population and spatial evolution of the entire association. Our results suggest suggests Car OB1 to be the most massive known star-forming complex in our Galaxy.","['C. Göppl', 'T.

MAISTEP -- a new grid-based machine learning tool for inferring stellar parameters I. Ages of giant-planet host stars,"Our understanding of exoplanet demographics partly depends on their corresponding host star parameters. With the majority of exoplanet-host stars having only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their parameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to develop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar radius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age distribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach involves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of stellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and luminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the inferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and LEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars hosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our machine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias (and a scatter) of -0.5\% (5\%) and -0.2\% (2\%) in radius, 6\% (5\%) per cent and -2\% (3\%) in mass, and -9\% (16\%) and 7\% (23\%) in age, respectively. Therefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic inferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass planets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm Jupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These statistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on stellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the average age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are statistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.","['Juma Kamulali', 'Benard Nsamba', 'Vardan Adibekyan', 'Achim Weiss', 'Tiago L.

The structure of $\kappa$ Cygnid and August Draconid meteoroid streams,"Meteoroid streams can be complex structures shaped by the processes of their formation and subsequent orbital evolution. The first step of their understanding is mapping their current stage. We used precise data from the European Fireball Network to disentangle the situation with meteor showers active in August and having radiants in the Cygnus-Draco area. In total, 179 fireballs observed between 2016-2024 were analyzed. We confirmed that two showers, $\kappa$ Cygnids and August Draconids, are present. The meteoroid swarm producing $\kappa$ Cygnids is locked in the 5:3 main-motion resonance with Jupiter with orbital period 7.12 years and has a limited extent of $\leq$ 90 degrees in mean anomaly. The shower is therefore markedly active only once or twice during each seven-year period. The orbits have wide range of inclinations, 28-44 degrees. There is a correlation between inclination, perihelion distance, and argument of perihelion due to observational selection effects. The radiant area is almost 30 degrees long in declination. August Draconids have even more extended radiant and can be divided into three branches depending on the position of the perihelion relative to the ecliptic plane. Neither of the showers can be described by a single set of orbital elements. We provide sets of representative orbits and identifications with showers previously reported in the literature. Physical properties of meteoroids and possible parent bodies are also discussed.","['J. Borovicka', 'P. Spurny', 'L. Kotkova', 'S. Molau', 'D. Tomko', 'T.

Instabilities of the kinematic state of the atmospheres of some single C-rich post-AGB stars,"To search for and study the instabilities in the atmospheres of selected post-AGB stars, we have performed a long-term high-resolution spectroscopy (R=60000) with the spectrograph NES of the 6-meter BTA telescope. Low-amplitude pulsations, splitting and/or asymmetry of the absorption profiles with a low excitation potential, as well as variability of a complex H$\alpha$ profile have been registered in the optical spectra of single stars associated with the IR sources IRASz02229+6208, IRAS 04296+3429, IRAS 07134+1005, IRAS 07430+1115, IRAS 19500-1709, IRAS 22223+4327, and IRAS 23304+6147 that had previously undergone the 3-d dredge-up. The maximum pulsation amplitude A$_{\rm Vr}$ was detected for the stars in the IRAS 07134+1005 and IRAS 19500-1709 systems, which have the maximum temperatures among the stars studied. Stratification of radial velocity in the atmosphere was found for two stars in the sample. The luminosity of the studied stars was estimated based on the intensity of the IR oxygen triplet OI(7774). Moreover, a luminosity of log${\rm (L/L_{\odot})}\approx$3.1 was obtained for the star in the IRAS 07430+1115 system within the typical values for post-AGB stars luminosity, which eliminates the paradox of the luminosity and the initial mass of this object.","['Valentina G.

The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: The morphologies of clusters of galaxies I: A catalogue of morphological parameters,"The first SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey, eRASS1, resulted in a catalogue of over twelve thousand optically-confirmed galaxy groups and clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere. Using the eROSITA images of these objects, we measure and study their morphological properties, including their concentration, central density and slope, ellipticity, power ratios, photon asymmetry, centroid shift and Gini coefficient. We also introduce new forward-modelled parameters which take account of the instrument point spread function (PSF), which are slosh, which measures how asymmetric the surface brightness distribution is, and multipole magnitudes, which are analogues to power ratios. Using simulations, we find some non forward-modelled parameters are strongly biased due to PSF and data quality. For the same clusters, we find similar values of concentration and central density compared to results by ourselves using Chandra and previous results from XMM-Newton. The population as a whole has log concentrations which are typically around 0.3 dex larger than South Pole Telescope or Planck-selected samples and the deeper eFEDS sample. The exposure time, detection likelihood threshold, extension likelihood threshold and number of counts affect the concentration distribution, but generally not enough to reduce the concentration to match the other samples. The concentration of clusters in the survey strongly affects whether they are detected as a function of redshift and luminosity. We introduce a combined disturbance score based on a Gaussian mixture model fit to several of the parameters. For brighter clusters, around 1/4 of objects are classified as disturbed using this score, which may be due to our sensitivity to concentrated objects.","['J. S. Sanders', 'Y. E. Bahar', 'E.

Novel geometrical test of cosmological expansion from photometric data,"In tomographic cosmic-shear observations, the BNT (Bernardeau, Nishimichi, Taruya) transform, Bernardeau et al. (2014), allows to build weak lensing transformed maps for which the contribution from low redshift lenses is nulled. As this transformation depends specifically on the expansion rate of the Universe but is independent of the matter distribution properties, it can be leveraged to extract information from large-scale structure probes at arbitrary non-linear scales, providing constraints on cosmological background evolution. We demonstrate this by proposing a specific null test for stage IV weak lensing projects. Using a Fisher matrix analysis and parameter sampling, we show that this approach can substantially enhance constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Notably, we find that shape noise currently limits this method's effectiveness making significant improvement possible in future designs.

Cosmic Shear Nulling as a geometrical cosmological probe: methodology and sensitivity to cosmological parameters and systematics,"In tomographic weak lensing surveys, the presence of nulling properties reveals symmetries inherent in the data, which rely solely on the geometrical properties of the Universe. Ensuring its validity thus provides us with constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe the background evolution, particularly the redshift dependence of the cosmological angular distance. This forms the basis of the tomographic cosmic shear nulling test that we introduce here. We outline how such a test can be executed, what it can constrain, and its specific efficiency in constraining cosmological parameters. Additionally, we explore its sensitivity to astrophysical effects such as magnification bias and reduced shear corrections, as well as observational systematics like errors in the mean redshift of the source bins. Our findings indicate that in a scenario akin to that of Euclid, this nulling test can bring significant and complementary constraints on basic cosmological parameters such as $\{\Omega_m,{\rm w}_0\}$, provided that the mean redshift of the bins are known at a level of $10^{-3}$. We conclude that the combination of nulling as a cosmological probe or a consistence test with usual weak lensing and galaxy clustering probes could allow to better keep systematics under control and bring more precise results in the future.","['Touzeau David', 'Bernardeau Francis', 'Benabed Karim', 'Codis Sandrine']",10.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02246,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,PRD,,[],2025-02-05
Reevaluation of ALMA detection of circumstellar PH3 in the AGB envelope IRC+10216: evidence for misidentification with HCN,"The article ""Confirmation of interstellar phosphine towards asymptotic giant branch star IRC+10216"" by A. Manna and S. Pal uses ALMA data of the C-star envelope IRC+10216 to claim a confirmation of the detection of PH3 in this source. The article however incorrectly assign an emission feature observed in the ALMA spectrum of IRC+10216 to PH3, while we find that it arises from a highly vibrationally excited state of HCN. Concretely the feature can be confidently assigned to the J=3-2 l=0 transition of HCN in the v1+4v2 vibrational state based on the observation of the l=+2 and l=-2 components of the same rotational transition, J=3-2, with the observed relative intensities in agreement with the relative line strengths.

Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm,"The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant $\Lambda_{E}$ manifested as a constant energy density of the vacuum, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. In this work, we interpret the non-zero $\Lambda_{E}$ through the lens of scale-invariant cosmology. We revisit the conformal scale factor $\lambda$ and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. Furthermore, we address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation, $g \sim \sqrt{a_0\,g_N}$, within the SIV context. Remarkably, the values obtained for $\Lambda_{E}$ and the MOND fundamental acceleration, $a_0$, align with observed magnitudes, specifically, $a_0 \approx 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\Lambda_{E} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-52} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$.

Primordial Black Hole Formation via Inverted Bubble Collapse,"We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the electroweak phase transition, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-6}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.","['Kai Murai', 'Kodai Sakurai', 'Fuminobu Takahashi']",3.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02291,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-02-05
Differentiable Cosmological Hydrodynamics for Field-Level Inference and High Dimensional Parameter Constraints,"Hydrodynamical simulations are the most accurate way to model structure formation in the universe, but they often involve a large number of astrophysical parameters modeling subgrid physics, in addition to cosmological parameters. This results in a high-dimensional space that is difficult to jointly constrain using traditional statistical methods due to prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we present a fully differentiable approach for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and a proof-of-concept implementation, diffhydro. By back-propagating through an upwind finite volume scheme for solving the Euler Equations jointly with a dark matter particle-mesh method for Poisson equation, we are able to efficiently evaluate derivatives of the output baryonic fields with respect to input density and model parameters. Importantly, we demonstrate how to differentiate through stochastically sampled discrete random variables, which frequently appear in subgrid models. We use this framework to rapidly sample sub-grid physics and cosmological parameters as well as perform field level inference of initial conditions using high dimensional optimization techniques.

Granulation and Convectional Driving on Stellar Surfaces,"Surface convection is important for the presence of magnetic activity at stars. So far, this convection is thought to be a result of heating from below, where convection cells rise and break up. New models reveal that surface convection is instead strongly driven by cooling from above. We compare two simulations of surface convection, one with a significant heating from below and one without. We obtain surface convection in both cases, and they show similar granulation patterns. The deep convection driven by heating from below is still evolving and asymptotically approaches a steady-state solution.

Consistent crust-core interpolation and its effect on non-radial neutron star oscillations,"To model the structure of neutron stars (NSs) theoretically,it is common to consider layers with different density regimes. Matching the equation of state (EoS) for the crust and core and obtaining a suitable description of these extreme conditions are crucial for understanding the properties of these compact objects. In this work, we construct ten different NS EoSs incorporating three distinct crust models, which are connected to the core using a thermodynamically and causally consistent formalism. For cold NSs, we propose a linear relationship between pressure and energy density in a narrow region between the crust and core, effectively establishing an interpolation function in the pressure-baryonic chemical potential plane. We then compare this EoS matching method with the classical approach, which neglects causal and thermodynamic consistency. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to obtain the mass-radius relationship and compare our results with observational constraints on NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the new matching formalism on non-radial oscillation frequencies and damping times. Our findings suggest that the method used to glue the crust and core EoS impacts NS observables, such as the radius, oscillation frequencies, and damping times of non-radial modes, which may be crucial for interpreting future gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers or isolated pulsars. The effects are particularly noticeable for low-mass NSs, regardless of the specific EoS model chosen. In particular, we find that the $p_1$ oscillation mode exhibits significant differences in frequencies among alternative matching methods, whereas the fundamental $f$-mode remains unaffected by changes in crust models or interpolation schemes.","['Martin O.

Modelling a Transiting Circumbinary Disc in the HD98800 System,"We present synthetic optical light curves of the hierarchical HD98800 quadruple system over a decade-long period when the circumbinary disc encircling the system's B binary is expected to eclipse the light from the A binary. We produce and compare light curves of this transit event using hydrodynamical models with different values of the disc's gas mass, dust mass, and $\alpha$-viscosity to determine the observable effect of each parameter. These comparisons provide insight that could aid in the analysis of observational data from the system when the real transit occurs and provide recommendations for how such observations should be made. We find that a higher dust mass or higher value of $\alpha$ correspond to a longer transit, with the gas mass having a more minor effect on the overall shape and duration of the transit. A higher $\alpha$ has an observable effect on the viscous spreading at the outer edge of the disc, though is countered through truncation by the outer binary. It is also shown that long-term interactions between the outer binary and disc can excite spiral arms in the disc, which introduce observable asymmetries to the light curve. Our models suggest that the transit should have begun at the time of writing, but no dimming has yet been observed. It is likely that the disc has a smaller radial extent than our models, due to a lower viscosity than can be simulated with SPH. The transit is expected to last 8-11 years, ending in late 2034 at the latest.","['Amena Faruqi', 'Grant Kennedy', 'Rebecca Nealon', 'Sahl Rowther']",13.0,12.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02376,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['hydrodynamics – radiative transfer – binaries: general – circumstellar matter 1 INTRODUCTION Protoplanetary discs are the progenitors of planetary systems', 'with observations showing these discs to have varied sizes and morphology (e']",2025-02-05
Search for a diffuse flux of photons with energies above tens of PeV at the Pierre Auger Observatory,"Diffuse photons of energy above 0.1 PeV, produced through the interactions between cosmic rays and either interstellar matter or background radiation fields, are powerful tracers of the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the measurement of a diffuse photon flux would be an important probe to test models of super-heavy dark matter decaying into gamma-rays. In this work, we search for a diffuse photon flux in the energy range between 50 PeV and 200 PeV using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the first time, we combine the air-shower measurements from a 2 km$^2$ surface array consisting of 19 water-Cherenkov surface detectors, spaced at 433 m, with the muon measurements from an array of buried scintillators placed in the same area. Using 15 months of data, collected while the array was still under construction, we derive upper limits to the integral photon flux ranging from 13.3 to 13.8 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above tens of PeV. We extend the Pierre Auger Observatory photon search program towards lower energies, covering more than three decades of cosmic-ray energy. This work lays the foundation for future diffuse photon searches: with the data from the next 10 years of operation of the Observatory, this limit is expected to improve by a factor of $\sim$20.","['Pierre Auger Collaboration', 'A.

Mixing neutron star material into the jets in the common envelope jets supernova r-process scenario,"I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, ~0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.",['Noam Soker'],0.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02411,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-02-05
Constraints on minimally and conformally coupled ultralight dark matter with the EPTA,"Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. In this conference paper, we start by reviewing the most conservative scenario, in which ultralight particles interact only gravitationally. In this setting, we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays are able to constrain the presence of ultralight fields up to a few tenths of the observed dark matter abundance. Then, we consider conformally coupled ultralight candidates, demonstrating that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude, in the relevant mass range analyzed by Pulsar Timing Arrays.

Modulation of X-ray flux by obscuration of neutron star boundary layer,"The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray variability of both black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) systems provide a tool for probing strong gravity and dense matter equations of state. Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori), we demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.","['Gabriel Török', 'Kateřina Klimovičová', 'Debora Lančová', 'Monika Matuszková', 'Eva Šrámková', 'Martin Urbanec', 'Miljenko Čemeljić', 'René Šprňa', 'Vladimír Karas']",5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02422,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['stars: black holes — stars: neutron — X-rays: binaries 1'],2025-02-05
Competition between Increasing and Decreasing Effects of the Afterpulsing Rate of PMTs during Night-Sky Observations,"Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been widely used in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the latest-generation IACTs, are optimized for challenging observations of low-energy gamma rays, specifically in the 20 to 150 GeV range. To this end, PMTs with an exceptionally low afterpulsing probability have been developed and installed. However, the afterpulsing rate increases over time due to the infiltration of atmospheric molecules, particularly helium, into the tube. Interestingly, we found that the afterpulsing rate decreases when PMTs are operated at high voltage and exposed to light -- a condition naturally met during IACT observations. To evaluate the latest instrument response, after five years of operation, we removed several PMTs from the first LST, which is currently the only operational telescope among the CTAO instruments. Our laboratory measurements showed no increase in afterpulsing compared to pre-installation values. This suggests that the decrease in afterpulsing during operation offsets the increase, thereby maintaining the long-term performance of the PMTs.","['Takuto Kiyomoto', 'Tsutomu Nagayoshi', 'Shunsuke Sakurai', 'Mitsunari Takahashi', 'Tokonatsu Yamamoto', 'Alice Donini', 'Yusuke Inome', 'Yukiho Kobayashi', 'Daniel Mazin', 'Razmik Mirzoyan', 'Seiya Nozaki', 'Hideyuki Ohoka', 'Akira Okumura', 'Takayuki Saito', 'Ryuji Takeishi', 'Masahiro Teshima']",3.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02423,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,"['Gamma telescopes', 'Cherenkov detectors', 'Photon detectors for UV', 'visible and IR photons (vacuum) 1Corresponding author']",2025-02-05

Testing the Equivalence Principle on Cosmological Scales Using Peculiar Acceleration Power Spectrum,"While the (weak) Equivalence Principle (EP) has been rigorously tested within the solar system, its validity on cosmological scales, particularly in the context of dark matter and dark energy, remains uncertain. In this study, we propose a novel method to test EP on cosmological scales by measuring the peculiar acceleration power spectrum of galaxies using the redshift drift technique. We develop an EP estimator, $E_{\rm ep}$, to evaluate the consistency of the peculiar acceleration power spectrum across different tracers. By calculating the ratio of the peculiar acceleration power spectra of tracers, the ensemble average of $E_{\rm ep}$ is expected to be unity if EP holds on cosmological scales for these tracers. We validate this estimator using N-body simulations, focusing on four redshift bins with $z\leq 1.5$ and scales of $k$ in the range of $0.007$ and $0.32$ $h/\rm Mpc$. By measuring $E_{\rm ep}$ using i) different samples of dark matter particle mock data and ii) low-mass and high-mass halo mock data, we find that the measured $E_{\rm ep}$ values are consistent with unity within the $2\sigma$ level, supporting the validity of $E_{\rm ep}$ on the linear cosmological scales. Taking advantage of advanced observing capabilities, such as next-generation facilities that extend beyond the Square Kilometer Array, the proposed method offers a promising approach for future cosmological tests of EP.","['Guoyuan Lu', 'Yi Zheng', 'Le Zhang', 'Xiaodong Li', 'Kwan Chuen Chan']",3.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02426,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-02-05

We find no trend between global or peak $f_{\text{dense}}$ and merger stage. We find no correlation between global $f_{\text{dense}}$ and X-ray luminosity; however, the correlation becomes significant when we measure $f_{\text{dense}}$ at the location of peak X-ray emission.

2D Surface Brightness Modelling of Large 2MASS Galaxies II: The Role of Classical Bulges and Pseudobulges on Galaxy Scaling Relations and its implication for Supermassive Black Hole Formation,"We have generated 2D-multicomponent surface brightness (SB) modelling for 100 galaxies in the Large Galaxy Atlas (LGA) together with 19 nearby cD galaxies using the near-infrared (NIR) images from 2MASS (J, H and Ks ). Our final sample of 119 galaxies includes cD galaxies, Virgo cluster galaxies, group galaxies, and field galaxies, but 68 % are spiral galaxies. We revisit known scaling relations (SRs) involving structure parameters, as well as those involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and ultramassive black holes (UMBHs). Refining the SRs, we revisited the classification of bulges. In this study, we have considered the Fundamental Plane (FP) and its projections, as well as other SRs, such as the colour-magnitude relation (CMR), the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and the luminosity-concentration relation (LCR). Classical bulges follow the same relations as elliptical galaxies, while pseudobulges are usually outliers. The NIR colours of classical bulges and pseudobulges indicate that their ages are not radically different despite their spread in luminosity, but we noticed that classical bulges are more luminous than pseudobulges; therefore, this property provides a complementary bulge/pseudobulge classification criterion. We have included pseudobulges from other studies to strengthen our sample's tendencies seen for pseudobulges in our sample. We also revised the SRs for SMBHs and UMBHs, finding that pseudobulges do not follow SRs for early-type galaxies and classical bulges. In addition, the lack of correlation between BHs and discs may indicate these structures have not coevolved. From the revision of SRs, we present a sample of galaxies likely to host SMBHs or UMBHs, which are suitable for dynamical BH mass determination accessible from the ground.","['Emmanuel Ríos-López', 'Omar López-Cruz', 'Christopher Añorve', 'Mabel Valerdi', 'Victoria R.

Titan's Fluvial and Lacustrine Landscapes,"In this chapter we begin with a review of Titan's fluvial and lacustrine landscapes as observed with Cassini remote sensing data, and what the many discoveries have revealed about Titan's surface materials and climate. Yet Cassini remote sensing data are coarse, topographic data are largely lacking, and the absence of in situ field measurements means we have little understanding of what the surface is composed of. At present, our knowledge of Titan's hydrology is comparable to that of Mars in the 1970's during the Viking era. Fortunately, the coming decades promise many new and exciting discoveries that can be achieved through Earth-based experiments, numerical modeling, and a continued commitment to the exploration of Titan by future missions, including both Dragonfly and orbiting assets. We therefore close the chapter with a discussion about what can be done with the current Cassini data and how new data, from both Dragonfly and a potential future orbiter, would allow us to leverage Titan to help solve some of the largest problems both here on Earth and on hydrologic planets and exoplanets more generally.","['Samuel P.D.

Short-Term Balmer Line Emission Variability in M Dwarfs,"M Dwarfs make up the majority of stars, offering an avenue for discovering exoplanets due to their smaller sizes. However, their magnetic activity poses challenges for exoplanet detection, characterization, and planetary habitability. Understanding its magnetic activity, including surface starspots and internal dynamos, is crucial for exoplanet research. In this study, we present short-term variability in four Balmer emission lines \ha, \hb, \hg, and \hd\ for a sample of 77 M dwarfs of varying spectral types, and binarity. Stars were observed using the MDM Observatory's Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 2.4m Telescope and the Modular Spectrograph on the 1.3 m Telescope. These data are combined with TESS photometry to explore the connection between spectroscopic and photometric variability. We observe sporadic short-term variability in Balmer lines for some stars, on timescale $\gtrsim$ 15-min, but much shorter than the stellar rotation period. We calculate periods for stars lacking those measurements, re-evaluated the relationship between amplitude (\rvar)-activity relation for the \ha \ line from \citet{garcia_soto_contemporaneous_2023}, and extended our analysis to the \hb, \hg \ and \hd \ lines, which indicates that the relation becomes increasingly dispersed for higher-order Balmer lines. This is consistent with increased intrinsic variability from lower to higher order lines. Additionally, we compute the Balmer decrement, using \hb \ as the fiducial, for stars where we could measure \hg \ and/or \hd. The Balmer decrement can show distinct patterns during white-light flares, with significant differences even for the same star.

Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure Formation,"Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.","['Clément Stahl', 'Denis Werth', 'Vivian Poulin']",9.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02571,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-02-05
Probing large-scale structures with the 2-point function and the power spectrum: insights into cosmic clustering evolution,"Understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe requires analysis of cosmic clustering and its evolution over time. In this work, we investigate the clustering properties of SDSS blue galaxies, which are excellent tracers of dark matter, along two distinct epochs of the Universe, utilizing estimators like the 2-point angular correlation function (2PACF), the angular power spectra, among others. Considering a model-independent approach, we perform analyses in two disjoint redshift shells, $0 \leq z < 0.06$ and $0.06 \leq z < 0.12$, to investigate the distribution of large cosmic structures. Using Bayesian inference methods, we constrain the parameter that quantifies the galaxy clustering in the 2PACF, enabling us to perform comparisons among different regions on the sky and between different epochs in the Universe regarding the gravitational action on matter structures. Our analyses complement previous efforts to map large-scale structures in the Local Universe. In addition, this study reveals differences regarding the clustering of large cosmic structures comparing two epochs of the Universe, analyses done with diverse estimators. Results reveal, clearly, distinct evolutionary signatures between the two redshift shells. Moreover, we had the opportunity to test the concordance cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, computing the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at very small scales. Ultimately, all our analyses serve as a set of consistency tests of the concordance cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM.","['Camila Franco', 'Felipe Avila', 'Armando Bernui']",18.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02574,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['large-scale structure of Universe – cosmology: observations I'],2025-02-05
DIISC -- VI (COS-DIISC): UV Metal Absorption Relative to the H I disk of Galaxies,"As part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we present the UV metal absorption features in the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) near the H I gas disk ($<$4.5$R_\mathrm{HI}$) of 31 nearby galaxies through quasar absorption line spectroscopy. Of the ions under study, Si III $\lambda1206$ was most frequently detected (18 of 31 sight lines), while C II $\lambda1334$ and Si II $\lambda1260$ were detected in 17 and 15 of 31 sight lines, respectively. Many components were consistent with photoionization equilibrium models, most of the cold and cool gas phase clouds were found to have lengths smaller than 2 kpc. Sight lines with smaller impact parameters ($\rho$) normalized by the galaxy's virial radius ($R_\mathrm{vir}$) and H I radius ($R_\mathrm{HI}$) tend to have more components and larger rest-frame equivalent widths ($W_r$) than those that probe the CGM at larger radii. In particular, we find that the location of metals are better traced by $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{HI}$ rather than the traditional $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{vir}$. Larger covering fractions are found closer to galaxies, with a radial decline that depends on the $W_r$ limit used.

New perspective on the multiple population phenomenon in Galactic globular clusters from a wide-field photometric survey,"Wide-field photometry of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has been investigated to overcome limitations from the small field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in the study of multiple populations. In particular, 'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to identify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field of view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an analyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G fraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat distribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the fraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across all mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions (hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost cluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial distribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only less massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that feature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster parameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader range of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances < 3.5 kpc. Besides, by using the Gaia data, it is observed that Group II GCs have higher energy on the integrals of motion diagrams than Group I GCs.","['S. Jang', 'A. P. Milone', 'A. F. Marino', 'M.

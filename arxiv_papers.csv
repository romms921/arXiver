Insights on Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks,"Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",['John F.

Hunting for the candidates of Changing-Look Blazar using Mclust Clustering Analysis,"The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $>$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.","['Shi-Ju Kang', 'Shan-Shan Ren', 'Yong-Gang Zheng', 'Qingwen Wu']",7.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00094,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Active galactic nuclei (16) – Blazars (164) — BL Lacertae objects (158) — Flat-spectrum radio quasars (2163) 1'],2025-01-03
First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs,"The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.","['Mathilde Mâlin', 'Anthony Boccaletti', 'Clément Perrot', 'Pierre Baudoz', 'Daniel Rouan', 'Pierre-Olivier Lagage', 'Rens Waters', 'Manuel Güdel', 'Thomas Henning', 'Bart Vandenbussche', 'Olivier Absil', 'David Barrado', 'Benjamin Charnay', 'Elodie Choquet', 'Christophe Cossou', 'Camilla Danielski', 'Leen Decin', 'Adrian M.

Exchange of meteorites between the terrestrial planets and the Moon,"The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude.

Autoencoder Reconstruction of Cosmological Microlensing Magnification Maps,"Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.","['Somayeh Khakpash', 'Federica Bianco', 'Georgios Vernardos', 'Gregory Dobler', 'Charles Keeton']",11.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00153,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal,,['- Interdisciplinary astronomy(804) 1'],2025-01-03
"The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays","We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.","['Hisashi Hayakawa', 'Edward W.

The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence.

Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?,"Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.","['Di Wu', 'Jing-Zhi Zhou', 'Yu-Ting Kuang', 'Zhi-Chao Li', 'Zhe Chang', 'Qing-Guo Huang']",7.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00228,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-03
Improving image quality of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the ASO-S mission,"The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.","['Hui Liu', 'Hui Li', 'Sizhong Zou', 'Kaifan Ji', 'Zhenyu Jin', 'Jiahui Shan', 'Jingwei Li', 'Guanglu Shi', 'Yu Huang', 'Li Feng', 'Jianchao Xue', 'Qiao Li', 'Dechao Song', 'Ying Li']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00231,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['techniques: image processing — sun: chromosphere — sun: flares — methods: numerical'],2025-01-03
On the Duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.",['Bing Zhang'],1.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00239,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Gamma-ray bursts', 'Relativistic fluid dynamics 1']",2025-01-03
An Investigation into the Variability of Luminous Blue Variable Stars with TESS,"Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.","['Becca Spejcher', 'Noel D.

"Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation","We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.","['Sripan Mondal', 'Akash Bairagi', 'A.

Red Giant Winds Driven by Alfv\'en Waves with Magnetic Diffusion,"We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfvén wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}=3.3\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénicthis http URLnonideal MHD simulation for $\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\dot{M}=1.5\times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\dot{M}=2.0\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr -- comparable to the observed value -- with transient magnetized hot bubbles.","['Takeru K.

Primordial Black Hole Formation from Power Spectrum with Finite-width,"Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.","['Shi Pi', 'Misao Sasaki', 'Volodymyr Takhistov', 'Jianing Wang']",30.0,61.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00295,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-03
A novel analysis of contamination in Lyman-break galaxy samples at $\boldsymbol{z\sim6-8}$: spatial correlation with intermediate-redshift galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z\sim1.3-2}$,"Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\%$ (at $90\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.","['Miftahul Hilmi', 'Nicha Leethochawalit', 'Michele Trenti', 'Benjamin Metha']",8.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00301,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 532, Issue 1, July 2024, Pages 920-931","['thousands of galaxy candi- dates at redshift 𝑧≳6have been recently discovered', 'galaxies: high-redshift – surveys – methods: statistical 1 INTRODUCTION Thanks to space-based observatories', 'primarily from several large survey programs conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (Schmidt et al']",2025-01-03
Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar,"We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\rm e}=3.1380\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\rm H}\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\approx14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\lambda991.51$ (${\rm log}\,n_{\rm c}=3.3\,\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\sim1.5-6.0\,Z\rm\,sun$, and is located at $\sim15\,\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.","['Qiguo Tian', 'Lei Hao', 'Yipeng Zhou', 'Xiheng Shi', 'Tuo Ji', 'Peng Jiang', 'Lin Lin', 'Zhenya Zheng', 'Hongyan Zhou']",15.0,17.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00311,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,"2024, ApJ, 977, 269",['galaxies: active — quasars: absorption lines — quasars: ind ividual (SDSS 122040'],2025-01-03
An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars II: Refined Solar Abundances via Extended Wavelength Coverage to 10 000 \AA,"This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.","['T. Şahin', 'F.

Circumstellar emission of Cepheids across the instability strip: Mid-infrared observations with VLTI/MATISSE,"The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\,\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\,R_\star$ and $f_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.","['V. Hocdé', 'A. Matter', 'N. Nardetto', 'A. Gallenne', 'P.

An efficient unsupervised classification model for galaxy morphology: Voting clustering based on coding from ConvNeXt large model,"In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\rm mag}< 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)>10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.","['Guanwen Fang', 'Yao Dai', 'Zesen Lin', 'Chichun Zhou', 'Jie Song', 'Yizhou Gu', 'Xiaotong Guo', 'Anqi Mao', 'Xu Kong']",12.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00380,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,A&A,,['Galaxy: general – Galaxy: structure – galaxies: statistics – Astrostatistics techniques – Astronomy data analysis 1'],2025-01-03
Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band,"Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\gtrsim 30\degree$, at $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.","['Yanping Cong', 'Bin Yue', 'Yidong Xu', 'Furen Deng', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Xuelei Chen']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00431,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Interstellar medium (847) — Interstellar plasma (851)— Interstellar absorption (831)— Milky Way Galaxy (1054) — Radio interferometers (1345) 1'],2025-01-03
A Novel Survey for Young Substellar Objects with the W-band Filter. VII. Water-Bearing Objects in the Core of the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex,"We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.","['Tanvi Sharma', 'Wen-Ping Chen', 'Beth Biller', 'Loic Albert', 'Belinda Damian', 'Jessy Jose', 'Bhavana Lalchand', 'Michael C.

JWST-ALMA Study of a Hub-Filament System in the Nascent Phase,"Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $<0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.","['N. K.

Fermi-LAT Discovery of a Gamma-ray Outburst from the Peculiar Compact Steep Spectrum Radiogalaxy 3C 216,"3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.","['Federica Giacchino', 'Giovanni La Mura', 'Stefano Ciprini', 'Dario Gasparrini', 'Marcello Giroletti', 'Marco Laurenti']",7.0,11.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00582,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma rays: galaxies — gamma-ray astronomy — high energy astrophysics — gamma-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — radio galaxies: individual (3C 216) — X-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — blazars — relativistic jets — spectral energy distribution 1'],2025-01-03
Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST,"We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.","['Andrew W.

Measurement of Turbulence Injection Scale Down to the Chromosphere,"The solar atmosphere displays a sharp temperature gradient, starting from spicules in the chromosphere at $2 \times 10^4$ K, outward into the corona exceeding $10^6$ K. Plasma turbulence produced by the transverse motion of magnetic fields anchored in the photosphere is likely the energy source producing this gradient. However, very little is known about the turbulent structures near the solar surface. Using the highest spatial resolution white-light total solar eclipse image to date, we measure the transverse correlation length at distances ranging from 0.33 to 9 Mm above the solar surface-two orders of magnitude closer than previous estimates. Our results show that the turbulence injection scale in the chromosphere is ~1.5 Mm, which we associate with the size of granules since they are the only structured features of comparable size. Further, the change in perpendicular correlation length with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4 Mm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower thereafter. We associate this radial gradient with the expansion of the magnetic field in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.","['Zac Bailey', 'Riddhi Bandyopadhyay', 'Shadia Habbal', 'Miloslav Druckmüller']",5.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00676,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ letters on Dec 21st 2024,,[],2025-01-03
Role of gravitational decoupling on theoretical insights of relativistic massive compact stars in the mass gap,"Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \, M_{\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\odot$ for $\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.","['S.K.Maurya', 'A. Errehymy', 'Ksh.

"Depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the solar photosphere","This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.","['S. Qutub', 'Y.N. Kalugina', 'M.

Prospects for measuring neutrino mass with 21-cm forest,"Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.","['Yue Shao', 'Guo-Hong Du', 'Tian-Nuo Li', 'Xin Zhang']",4.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00769,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-03
Influence of departures from LTE on determinations of the sulfur abundances in A-K type stars,"The influence of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) on neutral sulfur lines is considered. A grid of corrections is proposed to take into account the influence of departures from LTE for neutral sulfur lines in the visible and infrared spectral regions, including the H-band. The grid is calculated using the atomic model of sulfur incorporating the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. The inclusion of levels and transitions of ionized sulfur in the atomic model made it possible to expand the range of effective temperatures of stellar photospheres in the grid up to 10000 K. The atomic model was tested in determining the sulfur abundance of 13 stars and showed its adequacy in a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters. In the spectra of all test stars, the sulfur lines are fitted with similar abundances of the element, regardless of the degree of influence of the effects of deviation from LTE on a particular spectral line. For lines of several multiplets, the wavelengths and oscillator strengths were refined. A list of S I lines recommended for determining sulfur abundance has been created.","['S. A. Korotin', 'K. O.

Excess Ultraviolet Emission at High Galactic Latitudes: A New Horizons View,"We present new observations of the cosmic ultraviolet background (CUVB) at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 40^{\circ}$), made using the Alice UV spectrograph on board the New Horizons spacecraft. These observations were taken at about 57 AU from the Sun, outside much of the foreground emission affecting previous missions, and allowed a new determination of the spectrum of the CUVB between 912 -- 1100~Å and 1400 -- 1800~Å. We found a linear correlation between the CUVB and the Planck E(B~-~V) with offsets at zero-reddening of $221 \pm 11$ photon units at 1000~Å and $264 \pm 24$ \photu\ at 1500~Å ($4.4 \pm 0.2$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1000~Å and $5.3 \pm 0.5$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1500~Å). The former is the first firm detection of the offset in the range 912 -- 1100 Å while the latter result confirms previous results from \galex, showing that there is little emission from the Solar System from 1400 -- 1800 Å. About half of the offset may be explained by known sources (the integrated light of unresolved galaxies, unresolved stars, emission from ionized gas, and two-photon emission from warm hydrogen in the halo) with the source of the remaining emission as yet unidentified.

Unraveling the kinematic and morphological evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud,"We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (< 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (< 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\circ$ to 82$^\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\Theta$ (~ 180$^\circ$ to 240$^\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.","['S. R. Dhanush', 'A.

Stellar Weak Rates and Mass Fractions of 20 Most Important $fp$-shell Nuclei with $A < 65$,"This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars.

Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK.

Testing the extended corona model with the optical/UV reverberation mapping of the accretion disk,"The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppostthis http URLmost recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups.

An intriguing coincidence between the majority of the VPOS dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position,"A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.","['Istiak Akib', 'François Hammer', 'Yanbin Yang', 'Marcel S.

A metamaterial telescope at millimetre wavelengths,"In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $> 80\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.","['Giorgio Savini', 'Peter Hargrave', 'Peter A.R.

Chapter 15: Open Questions and Future Directions in Titan Science,"In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.","['Conor A.

The Role of Electric Dominance for Particle Injection in Relativistic Reconnection,"Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\sigma\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E>B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection'' stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\zeta(\epsilon^\ast,\epsilon_{\rm T}$) by $E>B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$; here, $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}$; for $\sigma\gtrsim 50$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}/\sigma\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\gtrsim 80\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$ occurs in $E>B$ regions. We find that $\zeta$ is independent of simulation box size $L_x$, as long as $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is normalized to the maximum particle energy, which scales as $\epsilon_{\rm max}\propto L_{\rm x}^{1/2}$ in 2D. The distribution of energy gains $\epsilon_{\chi}$ acquired in $E>B$ regions can be modeled as $dN/d\epsilon_{\chi}\propto\epsilon_{\chi}^{-0.35}\exp[-(\epsilon_{\chi}/0.06\,\sigma)^{0.5}]$. Our results help assess the role of electric dominance in relativistic reconnection with vanishing guide fields, which may be realized in the magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars.","['Sanya Gupta', 'Navin Sridhar', 'Lorenzo Sironi']",13.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00979,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,"['capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares', 'acceleration of particles – plasma astrophysics - magnetic reconnection - nonthermal particle acceleration 1 INTRODUCTION Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas—where the magneti- zation𝜎≫1(defined as the ratio of magnetic enthalpy density to plasma enthalpy density)—is regarded as an efficient particle accel- erator']",2025-01-03
The $z \gtrsim 9$ galaxy UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey: insights into early galaxy evolution and reionization,"The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\mathrm{UV}\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\geq14$ subset of the $z\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.","['Lily Whitler', 'Daniel P.

On the population of electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere of SgrA*,"In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.",['Zaza N.

Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC). VII. Disentangling Mass and Environment Quenching with the Aid of Galaxy-halo Connection in Simulations,"Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the twothis http URLaddress this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\bar{n}_2w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.","['Yun Zheng', 'Kun Xu', 'Donghai Zhao', 'Y.P.

"Detection of ""diffuse"" coronal He I 1083 during the April 8 2024 Solar Eclipse: evidence for terrestrial atmospheric scattering origin","Strong He I 1083 nm atomic line signals have been previously measured during total solar eclipses at coronal heights above the lunar limb. This rather unexpected measurement has kindled a discussion about the hypothesized presence of significant amounts of neutral helium at coronal conditions. We performed spectroscopic observations of the He I 1083 nm spectroscopic region with the newly built CHEESE instrument during the April 8th 2024 total solar eclipse to test the presence of He I 1083 in the solar corona. We detected the He I 1083, the forbidden coronal line Fe XIII 1074.7 nm, as well as the chromospheric H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} line in our eclipse observations. The chromospheric He I 1083 and H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} lines are detected in the corona as well as on the lunar disc. Our findings point toward a non-solar origin of the He I 1083 signal during the April 8th 2024 eclipse that challenge the notion of abundant neutral helium in the solar corona inferred from eclipse observations.","['M.

SpecPT (Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer) Model for Extragalactic Spectroscopy: I. Architecture and Automated Redshift Measurement,"We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 < z < 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.","['Rohan Pattnaik', 'Jeyhan S.

First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar,"We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively.

Probing exoplanetary magnetism via atomic alignment effect,"The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now.

LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7: A Detached White Dwarf-Main-sequence Binary with a Massive White Dwarf Within the Period Gap,"We report the analysis of the detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7, which features a massive white dwarf. Using LAMOST and SDSS spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and radial velocities of both components. SED fitting of photometric data from GALEX, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 yielded the effective temperatures and photometric radii. Eclipsing analysis of high-speed photometric data from the Liverpool Telescope provided orbital inclination, masses, radii, and related physical parameters. The white dwarf in this system has a mass of $1.05 \pm 0.09 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.0090 \pm 0.0008 \, R_\odot$, while the main-sequence star has a mass of $0.299 \pm 0.045 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.286 \pm 0.018 \, R_\odot$. Emission lines observed in the spectra indicate the likely presence of stellar magnetic activity in this system. The relatively cool temperature of the white dwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB) that has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white dwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic variable (dCV) crossing the period gap. We suggest that the system is more likely to be a PCEB, and it is predicted to evolve into a cataclysmic variable and begin mass transfer in approximately 0.27 Gyr.","['Yuji He', 'Hailong Yuan', 'Zhongrui Bai', 'Mingkuan Yang', 'Mengxin Wang', 'Yiqiao Dong', 'Xin Huang', 'Ming Zhou', 'Qian Liu', 'Xiaozhen Yang', 'Ganyu Li', 'Ziyue Jiang', 'Haotong Zhang']",8.0,16.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01171,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) on December 31,,['Cataclysmic variable stars (203)'],2025-01-03
The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation,"We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z<1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.","['Apashanka Das', 'Biswajit Pandey']",15.0,27.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01207,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-03
FEASTS: Radial Distribution of HI surface densities down to 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ of 35 Nearby Galaxies,"We present the HI surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\sim10^{18.1}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.","['Jing Wang', 'Dong Yang', 'Xuchen Lin', 'Qifeng Huang', 'Zhijie Qu', 'Hsiao-Wen Chen', 'Hong Guo', 'Luis C.

Systematic Search for Long-Term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei,"Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\approx$10\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.","['P. Penil', 'A. Domínguez', 'S. Buson', 'M. Ajello', 'S.

Multi-Observatory Study of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): No Evidence For Abnormally Strong Stellar Magnetic Fields After Powerful X-ray Flares,"We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and total surface magnetic flux (Phi), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.","['Konstantin V.

Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.","['Alfredo Micera', 'Daniel Verscharen', 'Jesse T.

Current constraints on cosmological scenarios with very low reheating temperatures,"We present an updated analysis of cosmological models with very low reheating scenarios ($T_\text{RH} \sim \mathcal{O}(\text{MeV})$). Our study includes a more precise computation of neutrino distribution functions, leveraging the latest datasets from cosmological surveys. We perform a joint analysis that combines constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and galaxy surveys, alongside separate investigations of these datasets, carefully assessing the impact of different choices of priors. At the $95\%$ confidence level, we establish a lower bound on the reheating temperature of $T_\text{RH} > 5.96 \; \text{MeV} $, representing the most stringent constraint to date.","['Nicola Barbieri', 'Thejs Brinckmann', 'Stefano Gariazzo', 'Massimiliano Lattanzi', 'Sergio Pastor', 'Ofelia Pisanti']",9.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01369,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-03
A Planet as the Possible Cause of the HD 181327 Debris Disk Asymmetry,"The debris disk around HD 181327 shows a significant asymmetry in its surface brightness profile when viewed in visible light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope STIS instrument show an arc of approximately 90 degrees of higher optical depth at a distance of 84 au from the star. We find that a 2-5 Jupiter-mass planet on a circular orbit at 62 au can produce and maintain a similar feature if the collisional lifetime of dust in the disk is at least 25 kiloyears, and smaller mass planets can produce similar results on longer timescales. We also find that the surface brightness asymmetry is much less pronounced at larger particle sizes, which may account for the fact that observations of HD181327 at longer wavelengths have not reported such an arc. We predict that if a planet is producing the arc in question, the planet is along the line joining the star to the feature, and make some estimates of its observability.","['Chris Fox', 'Paul Wiegert']",9.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01387,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['methods: numerical', 'planets and satellites: detection', 'stars: individual: HD 181327 1 INTRODUCTION HD 181327 (also known as HIP 95270) is an 18']",2025-01-03
The Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM): Validation of a Data Driven Bayesian Simultaneous Component Separation and Calibration Algorithm for EoR Foreground Modelling,"We introduce the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a novel data-driven Bayesian approach to modelling radio foregrounds at frequencies <400~MHz. B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors. This is the first of two papers, and is focused on validation of B-GSMs Bayesian framework, the second paper will present results of deployment on real data and introduce the low-frequency sky model which will be available for public download.","['George Carter', 'Will Handley', 'Mark Ashdown', 'Nima Razavi-Ghods']",8.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01417,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,"Nuclear Physics A 1052, 122941 (2024)","['reionization', 'Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics 1 INTRODUCTION Detection of the cosmological 21cm signal is limited by con- tamination by bright foreground emission that exceeds the expected signal by 3-6 orders of magnitude (Pritchard & Loeb 2012', 'diffuse radiation', 'cosmology: obser- vations', 'methods: statistical', 'Galaxy: general', 'ISM: general']",2025-01-03

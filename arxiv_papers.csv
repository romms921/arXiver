Insights on Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks,"Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",['John F.

Hunting for the candidates of Changing-Look Blazar using Mclust Clustering Analysis,"The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $>$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.","['Shi-Ju Kang', 'Shan-Shan Ren', 'Yong-Gang Zheng', 'Qingwen Wu']",7.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00094,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,['Active galactic nuclei (16) – Blazars (164) — BL Lacertae objects (158) — Flat-spectrum radio quasars (2163) 1'],2025-01-03
First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs,"The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.","['Mathilde Mâlin', 'Anthony Boccaletti', 'Clément Perrot', 'Pierre Baudoz', 'Daniel Rouan', 'Pierre-Olivier Lagage', 'Rens Waters', 'Manuel Güdel', 'Thomas Henning', 'Bart Vandenbussche', 'Olivier Absil', 'David Barrado', 'Benjamin Charnay', 'Elodie Choquet', 'Christophe Cossou', 'Camilla Danielski', 'Leen Decin', 'Adrian M.

Exchange of meteorites between the terrestrial planets and the Moon,"The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude.

Autoencoder Reconstruction of Cosmological Microlensing Magnification Maps,"Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.","['Somayeh Khakpash', 'Federica Bianco', 'Georgios Vernardos', 'Gregory Dobler', 'Charles Keeton']",11.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00153,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal,,['- Interdisciplinary astronomy(804) 1'],2025-01-03
"The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays","We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.","['Hisashi Hayakawa', 'Edward W.

The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence.

Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?,"Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.","['Di Wu', 'Jing-Zhi Zhou', 'Yu-Ting Kuang', 'Zhi-Chao Li', 'Zhe Chang', 'Qing-Guo Huang']",7.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00228,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-03
Improving image quality of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the ASO-S mission,"The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.","['Hui Liu', 'Hui Li', 'Sizhong Zou', 'Kaifan Ji', 'Zhenyu Jin', 'Jiahui Shan', 'Jingwei Li', 'Guanglu Shi', 'Yu Huang', 'Li Feng', 'Jianchao Xue', 'Qiao Li', 'Dechao Song', 'Ying Li']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00231,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['techniques: image processing — sun: chromosphere — sun: flares — methods: numerical'],2025-01-03
On the Duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.",['Bing Zhang'],1.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00239,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Gamma-ray bursts', 'Relativistic fluid dynamics 1']",2025-01-03
An Investigation into the Variability of Luminous Blue Variable Stars with TESS,"Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are enigmatic, evolved, massive stars. Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.","['Becca Spejcher', 'Noel D.

"Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation","We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.","['Sripan Mondal', 'Akash Bairagi', 'A.

Red Giant Winds Driven by Alfv\'en Waves with Magnetic Diffusion,"We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfvén wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}=3.3\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénicthis http URLnonideal MHD simulation for $\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\dot{M}=1.5\times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\dot{M}=2.0\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}/$yr -- comparable to the observed value -- with transient magnetized hot bubbles.","['Takeru K.

Primordial Black Hole Formation from Power Spectrum with Finite-width,"Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.","['Shi Pi', 'Misao Sasaki', 'Volodymyr Takhistov', 'Jianing Wang']",30.0,61.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00295,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-03
A novel analysis of contamination in Lyman-break galaxy samples at $\boldsymbol{z\sim6-8}$: spatial correlation with intermediate-redshift galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z\sim1.3-2}$,"Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\%$ (at $90\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.","['Miftahul Hilmi', 'Nicha Leethochawalit', 'Michele Trenti', 'Benjamin Metha']",8.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00301,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 532, Issue 1, July 2024, Pages 920-931","['thousands of galaxy candi- dates at redshift 𝑧≳6have been recently discovered', 'galaxies: high-redshift – surveys – methods: statistical 1 INTRODUCTION Thanks to space-based observatories', 'primarily from several large survey programs conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (Schmidt et al']",2025-01-03
Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar,"We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of $z_{\rm a}={3.1448}$ associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is $z_{\rm e}=3.1380\pm0.0007$, measured from the ${\rm H}\beta$+[O III] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines including the N V, N III, C IV, C III, Si IV, Si III, and H I Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with red-shifted velocities ranging from 200 to $900\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\approx14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\lambda991.51$ (${\rm log}\,n_{\rm c}=3.3\,\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\sim1.5-6.0\,Z\rm\,sun$, and is located at $\sim15\,\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.","['Qiguo Tian', 'Lei Hao', 'Yipeng Zhou', 'Xiheng Shi', 'Tuo Ji', 'Peng Jiang', 'Lin Lin', 'Zhenya Zheng', 'Hongyan Zhou']",15.0,17.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00311,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,"2024, ApJ, 977, 269",['galaxies: active — quasars: absorption lines — quasars: ind ividual (SDSS 122040'],2025-01-03
An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars II: Refined Solar Abundances via Extended Wavelength Coverage to 10 000 \AA,"This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.","['T. Şahin', 'F.

Circumstellar emission of Cepheids across the instability strip: Mid-infrared observations with VLTI/MATISSE,"The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\,\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\,R_\star$ and $f_\mathrm{CSE}\approx10\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.","['V. Hocdé', 'A. Matter', 'N. Nardetto', 'A. Gallenne', 'P.

An efficient unsupervised classification model for galaxy morphology: Voting clustering based on coding from ConvNeXt large model,"In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\rm mag}< 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)>10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.","['Guanwen Fang', 'Yao Dai', 'Zesen Lin', 'Chichun Zhou', 'Jie Song', 'Yizhou Gu', 'Xiaotong Guo', 'Anqi Mao', 'Xu Kong']",12.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00380,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,A&A,,['Galaxy: general – Galaxy: structure – galaxies: statistics – Astrostatistics techniques – Astronomy data analysis 1'],2025-01-03
Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band,"Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\gtrsim 30\degree$, at $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.","['Yanping Cong', 'Bin Yue', 'Yidong Xu', 'Furen Deng', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Xuelei Chen']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00431,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Interstellar medium (847) — Interstellar plasma (851)— Interstellar absorption (831)— Milky Way Galaxy (1054) — Radio interferometers (1345) 1'],2025-01-03
A Novel Survey for Young Substellar Objects with the W-band Filter. VII. Water-Bearing Objects in the Core of the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex,"We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.","['Tanvi Sharma', 'Wen-Ping Chen', 'Beth Biller', 'Loic Albert', 'Belinda Damian', 'Jessy Jose', 'Bhavana Lalchand', 'Michael C.

JWST-ALMA Study of a Hub-Filament System in the Nascent Phase,"Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $<0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.","['N. K.

Fermi-LAT Discovery of a Gamma-ray Outburst from the Peculiar Compact Steep Spectrum Radiogalaxy 3C 216,"3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.","['Federica Giacchino', 'Giovanni La Mura', 'Stefano Ciprini', 'Dario Gasparrini', 'Marcello Giroletti', 'Marco Laurenti']",7.0,11.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00582,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma rays: galaxies — gamma-ray astronomy — high energy astrophysics — gamma-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — radio galaxies: individual (3C 216) — X-ray sources: individual (3C 216) — blazars — relativistic jets — spectral energy distribution 1'],2025-01-03
Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST,"We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.","['Andrew W.

Measurement of Turbulence Injection Scale Down to the Chromosphere,"The solar atmosphere displays a sharp temperature gradient, starting from spicules in the chromosphere at $2 \times 10^4$ K, outward into the corona exceeding $10^6$ K. Plasma turbulence produced by the transverse motion of magnetic fields anchored in the photosphere is likely the energy source producing this gradient. However, very little is known about the turbulent structures near the solar surface. Using the highest spatial resolution white-light total solar eclipse image to date, we measure the transverse correlation length at distances ranging from 0.33 to 9 Mm above the solar surface-two orders of magnitude closer than previous estimates. Our results show that the turbulence injection scale in the chromosphere is ~1.5 Mm, which we associate with the size of granules since they are the only structured features of comparable size. Further, the change in perpendicular correlation length with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4 Mm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower thereafter. We associate this radial gradient with the expansion of the magnetic field in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.","['Zac Bailey', 'Riddhi Bandyopadhyay', 'Shadia Habbal', 'Miloslav Druckmüller']",5.0,13.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00676,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ letters on Dec 21st 2024,,[],2025-01-03
Role of gravitational decoupling on theoretical insights of relativistic massive compact stars in the mass gap,"Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \, M_{\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\odot$ for $\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.","['S.K.Maurya', 'A. Errehymy', 'Ksh.

"Depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the solar photosphere","This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.","['S. Qutub', 'Y.N. Kalugina', 'M.

Prospects for measuring neutrino mass with 21-cm forest,"Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.","['Yue Shao', 'Guo-Hong Du', 'Tian-Nuo Li', 'Xin Zhang']",4.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00769,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-03
Influence of departures from LTE on determinations of the sulfur abundances in A-K type stars,"The influence of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) on neutral sulfur lines is considered. A grid of corrections is proposed to take into account the influence of departures from LTE for neutral sulfur lines in the visible and infrared spectral regions, including the H-band. The grid is calculated using the atomic model of sulfur incorporating the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. The inclusion of levels and transitions of ionized sulfur in the atomic model made it possible to expand the range of effective temperatures of stellar photospheres in the grid up to 10000 K. The atomic model was tested in determining the sulfur abundance of 13 stars and showed its adequacy in a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters. In the spectra of all test stars, the sulfur lines are fitted with similar abundances of the element, regardless of the degree of influence of the effects of deviation from LTE on a particular spectral line. For lines of several multiplets, the wavelengths and oscillator strengths were refined. A list of S I lines recommended for determining sulfur abundance has been created.","['S. A. Korotin', 'K. O.

Excess Ultraviolet Emission at High Galactic Latitudes: A New Horizons View,"We present new observations of the cosmic ultraviolet background (CUVB) at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 40^{\circ}$), made using the Alice UV spectrograph on board the New Horizons spacecraft. These observations were taken at about 57 AU from the Sun, outside much of the foreground emission affecting previous missions, and allowed a new determination of the spectrum of the CUVB between 912 -- 1100~Å and 1400 -- 1800~Å. We found a linear correlation between the CUVB and the Planck E(B~-~V) with offsets at zero-reddening of $221 \pm 11$ photon units at 1000~Å and $264 \pm 24$ \photu\ at 1500~Å ($4.4 \pm 0.2$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1000~Å and $5.3 \pm 0.5$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1500~Å). The former is the first firm detection of the offset in the range 912 -- 1100 Å while the latter result confirms previous results from \galex, showing that there is little emission from the Solar System from 1400 -- 1800 Å. About half of the offset may be explained by known sources (the integrated light of unresolved galaxies, unresolved stars, emission from ionized gas, and two-photon emission from warm hydrogen in the halo) with the source of the remaining emission as yet unidentified.

Unraveling the kinematic and morphological evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud,"We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (< 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (< 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\circ$ to 82$^\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\Theta$ (~ 180$^\circ$ to 240$^\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.","['S. R. Dhanush', 'A.

Stellar Weak Rates and Mass Fractions of 20 Most Important $fp$-shell Nuclei with $A < 65$,"This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars.

Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK.

Testing the extended corona model with the optical/UV reverberation mapping of the accretion disk,"The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppostthis http URLmost recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups.

An intriguing coincidence between the majority of the VPOS dwarfs and a recent major merger at the M31 position,"A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.","['Istiak Akib', 'François Hammer', 'Yanbin Yang', 'Marcel S.

A metamaterial telescope at millimetre wavelengths,"In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $> 80\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.","['Giorgio Savini', 'Peter Hargrave', 'Peter A.R.

Chapter 15: Open Questions and Future Directions in Titan Science,"In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.","['Conor A.

The Role of Electric Dominance for Particle Injection in Relativistic Reconnection,"Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\sigma\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E>B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection'' stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\zeta(\epsilon^\ast,\epsilon_{\rm T}$) by $E>B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$; here, $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}$; for $\sigma\gtrsim 50$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}/\sigma\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\gtrsim 80\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$ occurs in $E>B$ regions. We find that $\zeta$ is independent of simulation box size $L_x$, as long as $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is normalized to the maximum particle energy, which scales as $\epsilon_{\rm max}\propto L_{\rm x}^{1/2}$ in 2D. The distribution of energy gains $\epsilon_{\chi}$ acquired in $E>B$ regions can be modeled as $dN/d\epsilon_{\chi}\propto\epsilon_{\chi}^{-0.35}\exp[-(\epsilon_{\chi}/0.06\,\sigma)^{0.5}]$. Our results help assess the role of electric dominance in relativistic reconnection with vanishing guide fields, which may be realized in the magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars.","['Sanya Gupta', 'Navin Sridhar', 'Lorenzo Sironi']",13.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00979,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,"['capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares', 'acceleration of particles – plasma astrophysics - magnetic reconnection - nonthermal particle acceleration 1 INTRODUCTION Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas—where the magneti- zation𝜎≫1(defined as the ratio of magnetic enthalpy density to plasma enthalpy density)—is regarded as an efficient particle accel- erator']",2025-01-03
The $z \gtrsim 9$ galaxy UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey: insights into early galaxy evolution and reionization,"The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\mathrm{UV}\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\geq14$ subset of the $z\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.","['Lily Whitler', 'Daniel P.

On the population of electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere of SgrA*,"In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.",['Zaza N.

Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC). VII. Disentangling Mass and Environment Quenching with the Aid of Galaxy-halo Connection in Simulations,"Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the twothis http URLaddress this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\bar{n}_2w_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\mathrm{sat}}_{\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\mathrm{sat}})$, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{q}}^{\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.","['Yun Zheng', 'Kun Xu', 'Donghai Zhao', 'Y.P.

"Detection of ""diffuse"" coronal He I 1083 during the April 8 2024 Solar Eclipse: evidence for terrestrial atmospheric scattering origin","Strong He I 1083 nm atomic line signals have been previously measured during total solar eclipses at coronal heights above the lunar limb. This rather unexpected measurement has kindled a discussion about the hypothesized presence of significant amounts of neutral helium at coronal conditions. We performed spectroscopic observations of the He I 1083 nm spectroscopic region with the newly built CHEESE instrument during the April 8th 2024 total solar eclipse to test the presence of He I 1083 in the solar corona. We detected the He I 1083, the forbidden coronal line Fe XIII 1074.7 nm, as well as the chromospheric H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} line in our eclipse observations. The chromospheric He I 1083 and H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} lines are detected in the corona as well as on the lunar disc. Our findings point toward a non-solar origin of the He I 1083 signal during the April 8th 2024 eclipse that challenge the notion of abundant neutral helium in the solar corona inferred from eclipse observations.","['M.

SpecPT (Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer) Model for Extragalactic Spectroscopy: I. Architecture and Automated Redshift Measurement,"We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 < z < 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.","['Rohan Pattnaik', 'Jeyhan S.

First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar,"We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively.

Probing exoplanetary magnetism via atomic alignment effect,"The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now.

LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7: A Detached White Dwarf-Main-sequence Binary with a Massive White Dwarf Within the Period Gap,"We report the analysis of the detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7, which features a massive white dwarf. Using LAMOST and SDSS spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and radial velocities of both components. SED fitting of photometric data from GALEX, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 yielded the effective temperatures and photometric radii. Eclipsing analysis of high-speed photometric data from the Liverpool Telescope provided orbital inclination, masses, radii, and related physical parameters. The white dwarf in this system has a mass of $1.05 \pm 0.09 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.0090 \pm 0.0008 \, R_\odot$, while the main-sequence star has a mass of $0.299 \pm 0.045 \, M_\odot$ and a radius of $0.286 \pm 0.018 \, R_\odot$. Emission lines observed in the spectra indicate the likely presence of stellar magnetic activity in this system. The relatively cool temperature of the white dwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB) that has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white dwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic variable (dCV) crossing the period gap. We suggest that the system is more likely to be a PCEB, and it is predicted to evolve into a cataclysmic variable and begin mass transfer in approximately 0.27 Gyr.","['Yuji He', 'Hailong Yuan', 'Zhongrui Bai', 'Mingkuan Yang', 'Mengxin Wang', 'Yiqiao Dong', 'Xin Huang', 'Ming Zhou', 'Qian Liu', 'Xiaozhen Yang', 'Ganyu Li', 'Ziyue Jiang', 'Haotong Zhang']",8.0,16.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01171,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) on December 31,,['Cataclysmic variable stars (203)'],2025-01-03
The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation,"We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z<1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.","['Apashanka Das', 'Biswajit Pandey']",15.0,27.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01207,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-03
FEASTS: Radial Distribution of HI surface densities down to 0.01 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ of 35 Nearby Galaxies,"We present the HI surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\sim10^{18.1}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.","['Jing Wang', 'Dong Yang', 'Xuchen Lin', 'Qifeng Huang', 'Zhijie Qu', 'Hsiao-Wen Chen', 'Hong Guo', 'Luis C.

Systematic Search for Long-Term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei,"Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\approx$10\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.","['P. Penil', 'A. Domínguez', 'S. Buson', 'M. Ajello', 'S.

Multi-Observatory Study of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): No Evidence For Abnormally Strong Stellar Magnetic Fields After Powerful X-ray Flares,"We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and total surface magnetic flux (Phi), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.","['Konstantin V.

Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.","['Alfredo Micera', 'Daniel Verscharen', 'Jesse T.

Current constraints on cosmological scenarios with very low reheating temperatures,"We present an updated analysis of cosmological models with very low reheating scenarios ($T_\text{RH} \sim \mathcal{O}(\text{MeV})$). Our study includes a more precise computation of neutrino distribution functions, leveraging the latest datasets from cosmological surveys. We perform a joint analysis that combines constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and galaxy surveys, alongside separate investigations of these datasets, carefully assessing the impact of different choices of priors. At the $95\%$ confidence level, we establish a lower bound on the reheating temperature of $T_\text{RH} > 5.96 \; \text{MeV} $, representing the most stringent constraint to date.","['Nicola Barbieri', 'Thejs Brinckmann', 'Stefano Gariazzo', 'Massimiliano Lattanzi', 'Sergio Pastor', 'Ofelia Pisanti']",9.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01369,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-03
A Planet as the Possible Cause of the HD 181327 Debris Disk Asymmetry,"The debris disk around HD 181327 shows a significant asymmetry in its surface brightness profile when viewed in visible light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope STIS instrument show an arc of approximately 90 degrees of higher optical depth at a distance of 84 au from the star. We find that a 2-5 Jupiter-mass planet on a circular orbit at 62 au can produce and maintain a similar feature if the collisional lifetime of dust in the disk is at least 25 kiloyears, and smaller mass planets can produce similar results on longer timescales. We also find that the surface brightness asymmetry is much less pronounced at larger particle sizes, which may account for the fact that observations of HD181327 at longer wavelengths have not reported such an arc. We predict that if a planet is producing the arc in question, the planet is along the line joining the star to the feature, and make some estimates of its observability.","['Chris Fox', 'Paul Wiegert']",9.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01387,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['methods: numerical', 'planets and satellites: detection', 'stars: individual: HD 181327 1 INTRODUCTION HD 181327 (also known as HIP 95270) is an 18']",2025-01-03
The Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM): Validation of a Data Driven Bayesian Simultaneous Component Separation and Calibration Algorithm for EoR Foreground Modelling,"We introduce the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a novel data-driven Bayesian approach to modelling radio foregrounds at frequencies <400~MHz. B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors. This is the first of two papers, and is focused on validation of B-GSMs Bayesian framework, the second paper will present results of deployment on real data and introduce the low-frequency sky model which will be available for public download.","['George Carter', 'Will Handley', 'Mark Ashdown', 'Nima Razavi-Ghods']",8.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01417,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,"Nuclear Physics A 1052, 122941 (2024)","['reionization', 'Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics 1 INTRODUCTION Detection of the cosmological 21cm signal is limited by con- tamination by bright foreground emission that exceeds the expected signal by 3-6 orders of magnitude (Pritchard & Loeb 2012', 'diffuse radiation', 'cosmology: obser- vations', 'methods: statistical', 'Galaxy: general', 'ISM: general']",2025-01-03
Stellar Physics and General Relativity,"The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model.

"Distribution of the H\""ogbom CLEAN Algorithm Using Tiled Images with Feedback","Data sizes for next generation radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), are far above that of their predecessors. The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed by Högbom [1974], long before such data sizes were thought possible and is still the most popular tool used for deconvolution in interferometric imaging. In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and reduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been investigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching pursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of tiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this creates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to deconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated with bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the tiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has been tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known intensity. When compared to a standard Högbom deconvolution the tiled feedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1 Jy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across the whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.","['Daniel Wright', 'Karel Adámek', 'Wesley Armour']",5.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01461,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-06
Sequencing Silicates in the IRS Debris Disk Catalog I: Methodology for Unsupervised Clustering,"Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.","['Cicero X.

A Near-IR Search for Helium in the Superluminous Supernova SN 2024ahr,"We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of $z=0.0861$. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g\approx M_r\approx -21$ mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50$\%$ of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of $\approx 3.3$ ms, a magnetic field strength of $\approx 6\times 10^{13}$ G, and an ejecta mass of $\approx 9.5$ M$_\odot$. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I $\,\lambda 2.058$ $\mu$m feature, and place a conservative upper limit of $\sim 0.05$ M$_\odot$ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I $\,\lambda 1.575$ $\mu$m and a blend of Co II $\,\lambda 2.126$ $\mu$m and Mg II, $\lambda 2.136$ $\mu$m, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I.","['Harsh Kumar', 'Edo Berger', 'Peter K.

Line detections in photospheric radius expansion bursts from 4U 1820-303,"Context: NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) is the instrument of choice for the spectral analysis of type I X-ray bursts, as it provides high throughput at X-ray CCD resolution, down to 0.3 keV. Aims: This study investigates whether the energies of absorption lines detected in photospheric radius expansion (PRE) bursts correlate with the inferred blackbody radius. Previous reports suggested such a correlation, attributed to a combination of weaker gravitational redshift and higher blueshifts in bursts with larger radii. Methods: The analysis reexamines four previously studied PRE bursts and examines eight additional bursts from 4U 1820-303, evidencing PRE. Spectral evolution is tracked on the shortest possible timescales (tenth of a second) adopting two parallel continuum descriptions to characterise the photospheric expansion and line evolution. Applying the accretion-enhanced model, maximum blackbody radii of up to $\sim$ 900 km are inferred, with peak bolometric luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit of an Helium accretor. Absorption lines are assessed for significance using Monte Carlo simulations, and spectral lines are characterised using the state-of-art plasma codes available within {\sc{spex}} with a phenomenological continuum. A thorough parameter search explores Doppler shifts to avoid local minima. Results: Several significant (> 99.9%) absorption lines, including the previously reported 2.97 keV line, are detected. While no consistent correlation between line energies and blackbody radii is confirmed, bursts with larger radii exhibit up to four lines and the line strength is higher. The modelling suggests that the observed lines mostly originate from slightly redshifted (almost rest-frame) photo-/collisionally ionised gas in emission. For the burst with the largest PRE, a combination of photo-ionised plasma in both emission and absorption is preferred.","['F. Barra', 'D. Barret', 'C. Pinto', 'T. Di Salvo', 'N. Weinberg', 'S.

A Link Between White Dwarf Pulsars and Polars: Multiwavelength Observations of the 9.36-Minute Period Variable Gaia22ayj,"White dwarfs (WDs) are the most abundant compact objects, and recent surveys have suggested that over a third of WDs in accreting binaries host a strong (B $\gtrsim$ 1 MG) magnetic field. However, the origin and evolution of WD magnetism remain under debate. Two WD pulsars, AR Sco and J191213.72-441045.1 (J1912), have been found, which are non-accreting binaries hosting rapidly spinning (1.97-min and 5.30-min, respectively) magnetic WDs. The WD in AR Sco is slowing down on a $P/\dot{P}\approx 5.6\times 10^6$ yr timescale. It is believed they will eventually become polars, accreting systems in which a magnetic WD (B $\approx 10-240$ MG) accretes from a Roche lobe-filling donor spinning in sync with the orbit ($\gtrsim 78$ min). Here, we present multiwavelength data and analysis of Gaia22ayj, which outbursted in March 2022. We find that Gaia22ayj is a magnetic accreting WD that is rapidly spinning down ($P/\dot{P} = 6.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times 10^6$ yr) like WD pulsars, but shows clear evidence of accretion, like polars. Strong linear polarization (40%) is detected in Gaia22ayj; such high levels have only been seen in the WD pulsar AR Sco and demonstrate the WD is magnetic. High speed photometry reveals a 9.36-min period accompanying a high amplitude ($\sim 2$ mag) modulation. We associate this with a WD spin or spin-orbit beat period, not an orbital period as was previously suggested. Fast (60-s) optical spectroscopy reveals a broad ``hump'', reminiscent of cyclotron emission in polars, between 4000-8000 Angstrom. We find an X-ray luminosity of $L_X = 2.7_{-0.8}^{+6.2}\times10^{32} \textrm{ erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.3-8 keV energy range, while two VLA radio campaigns resulted in a non-detection with a $F_r < 15.8\mu\textrm{Jy}$ 3$ \sigma$ upper limit. The shared properties of both WD pulsars and polars suggest that Gaia22ayj is a missing link between the two classes of magnetic WD binaries.","['Antonio C.

A 22-Billion Solar Mass Black Hole in Holmberg 15A with Keck KCWI Spectroscopy and Triaxial Orbit Modeling,"Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a ${\sim}100''\times 100''$ contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low amplitude (${\sim}20\mathrm{~km~s}^{-1}$) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over ${\sim}$40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of $p=0.89$ for the middle-to-long principal axes and $q=0.65$ for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, $M_\mathrm{BH}=(2.16^{+0.23}_{-0.18})\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, makes H15A -- along with NGC 4889 -- the galaxies hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean $M_\mathrm{BH}-\sigma$ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases $M_\mathrm{BH}$ to $(2.55\pm 0.20) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, which is still significantly below $M_\mathrm{BH}=(4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.","['Emily R.

Search for continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run,"Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of 45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude is $6.4\!\times\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\!\times\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal.

"ORACLE: A Real-Time, Hierarchical, Deep-Learning Photometric Classifier for the LSST","We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier.

"TOI-421 b: A Hot Sub-Neptune with a Haze-Free, Low Mean Molecular Weight Atmosphere","Common features of sub-Neptunes atmospheres observed to date include signatures of aerosols at moderate equilibrium temperatures (~500-800 K), and a prevalence of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, perhaps indicating novel classes of planets such as water worlds. Here we present a 0.83-5 micron JWST transmission spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-421 b. This planet is unique among previously observed counterparts in its high equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} \approx 920$) and its Sun-like host star. We find marked differences between the atmosphere of TOI-421 b and those of sub-Neptunes previously characterized with JWST, which all orbit M stars. Specifically, water features in the NIRISS/SOSS bandpass indicate a low mean molecular weight atmosphere consistent with solar metallicity, and no appreciable aerosol coverage. Hints of SO$_2$ and CO (but not CO$_2$ or CH$_4$) also exist in our NIRSpec/G395M observations, but not at sufficient signal-to-noise to draw firm conclusions. Our results support a picture in which sub-Neptunes hotter than ~850 K do not form hydrocarbon hazes due to a lack of methane to photolyze. TOI-421 b additionally fits the paradigm of the radius valley for planets orbiting FGK stars being sculpted by mass loss processes, which would leave behind primordial atmospheres overlying rock/iron interiors. Further observations of TOI-421 b and similar hot sub-Neptunes will confirm whether haze-free atmospheres and low mean molecular weights are universal characteristics of such objects.","['Brian Davenport', 'Eliza M.-R.

Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background,"The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution. In contrast, the contribution from supermassive BHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals.

Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function -- its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space -- underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov--Poisson simulations, which confirm it.","['Yonadav Barry Ginat', 'Michael L. Nastac', 'Robert J.

An Integral Field Unit for the Binospec Spectrograph,"Binospec is a wide-field optical (360 to 1000 nm) spectrograph commissioned at the MMT 6.5m telescope in 2017. In direct imaging mode Binospec addresses twin 8$^\prime$ (wide) by 15$^\prime$ (slit length) fields of view. We describe an optical fiber based integral field unit (IFU) that remaps a 12$^{\prime\prime}$ x 16$^{\prime\prime}$ contiguous region onto two pseudo slits, one in each Binospec channel. The IFU, commissioned in 2023, fits into the space of a standard slit mask frame and can be deployed as desired in a mixed program of slit masks, long slits, and IFU observations. The IFU fibers are illuminated by a hexagonal lenslet array with a 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ pitch. A separate bundle of sky fibers consists of close-packed bare fibers arranged within an 11.8$^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. The 640 IFU fibers and 80 sky fibers have a core diameter of 150$\mu$m, corresponding to 0.90$^{\prime\prime}$.

SN 2018is: a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova with narrow hydrogen emission lines at early phases,"We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the Type IIP SN 2018is. The $V$-band luminosity and the expansion velocity at 50 days post-explosion are $-$15.1$\pm$0.2 mag (corrected for A$_V$=1.34 mag) and 1400 km s$^{-1}$, classifying it as a low-luminosity SN II. The recombination phase in the $V$-band is shorter, lasting around 110 days, and exhibits a steeper decline (1.0 mag per 100 days) compared to most other low-luminosity SNe II. Additionally, the optical and near-infrared spectra display hydrogen emission lines that are strikingly narrow, even for this class. The Fe II and Sc II line velocities are at the lower end of the typical range for low-luminosity SNe II. Semi-analytical modelling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $\sim$8 M$_\odot$, corresponding to a pre-supernova mass of $\sim$9.5 M$_\odot$, and an explosion energy of $\sim$0.40 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. Hydrodynamical modelling further indicates that the progenitor had a zero-age main sequence mass of 9 M$_\odot$, coupled with a low explosion energy of 0.19 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. The nebular spectrum reveals weak [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 lines, consistent with a moderate-mass progenitor, while features typical of Fe core-collapse events, such as He I, [C I], and [Fe I], are indiscernible. However, the redder colours and low ratio of Ni to Fe abundance do not support an electron-capture scenario either. As a low-luminosity SN II with an atypically steep decline during the photospheric phase and remarkably narrow emission lines, SN 2018is contributes to the diversity observed within this population.","['R.

Compton Scattering of Thermal Disk Radiation with Black Hole Disk Winds,"Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries are known to exhibit episodic outbursts, during which accretion and spectral mode distinctively transition between low/hard and high/soft state. X-ray observations during high/soft state occasionally reveal a pronounced presence of a powerful disk wind in these systems. However, it is unexplored to date how such winds may influence disk emission in that regime.In this work, we consider an observational implication by Compton scattering of thermal disk radiation due to accretion disk winds by performing multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations in the context of a stratified wind of large solid angle launched over a large radial extent of the disk. Compton-scattered thermal disk spectrum is computed for a different wind property; i.e. wind density and its radial gradient. We find that the intrinsic disk radiation can be significantly down-scattered by winds of moderate-to-high density to the extent that the transmitted spectrum can substantially deviate from the conventional multi-color-disk emission by factor of up to 70\%. We thus claim that the conventional treatment of spectral hardening in the disk atmosphere may be insufficient to fully account for the observed disk continuum in the presence of strong wind scattering.It is suggested that the effect of scattering process (by $f_w$) should be incorporated to accurately evaluate an intrinsic disk spectrum besides the conventional hardening (color correction) factor (by $f_c$). We argue that BH spin measurements using thermal continuum-fitting in transient XRBs may well be mildly (if not significantly) altered by such spectral ``contamination"".",['Keigo Fukumura'],49.0,39.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01532,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Accretion (14) — Computational methods (1965) — Low-mass x-ray binary stars (939) — Stellar mass black holes (1611) — X-ray transient sources (1852) — Black hole physics (159) — Spectroscopy (1558) — Astrophysical black holes(98) — X-ray astronomy(1810)'],2025-01-06
"Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics","For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 < H_r < 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.","['Pedro H. Bernardinelli', 'Gary M.

Jewel Optics I: non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the guilt,"The enduring technique of aperture masking interferometry, now more than 150 years old, is still widely practised today for it opens a window of high angular resolution astronomy that remains difficult to access by any competing technology. However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant array dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\sim$10\% or less. This in turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to only bright science targets. This paper presents ""Jewel Optics"", a novel technology that leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional aperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of sparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique phase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all individual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area of the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts light from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector. We demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the Subaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab results. We discuss a design refinement for producing fully achromatic Jewel Optics, and finally we highlight the potential for future work with these novel optical components.","['Adam K.

Microlensing of lensed supernovae Zwicky & iPTF16geu: constraints on the lens galaxy mass slope and dark compact object fraction,"To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} < 0.47$ for SN Zwicky. Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.","['Nikki Arendse', 'Edvard Mörtsell', 'Luke Weisenbach', 'Erin Hayes', 'Stephen Thorp', 'Suhail Dhawan', 'Ariel Goobar', 'Sacha Guerrini', 'Jacob Osman Hjortlund', 'Joel Johansson', 'Cameron Lemon']",12.0,19.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01578,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-06
Millihertz Oscillations Near the Innermost Orbit of a Supermassive Black Hole,"Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to mHz frequency gravitational wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant mHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, UV, and X-ray outburst beginning in 2018. The QPO was first detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on scales of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical QPEs. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over two years with a decelerating period evolution ($\ddot{P} > 0$). This evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular momentum losses, while the lack of a direct analog to stellar mass black hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational wave emission.","['Megan Masterson', 'Erin Kara', 'Christos Panagiotou', 'William N.

Fire and Ice in the Whirlpool: Spatially Resolved Scaling Relations between X-ray Emitting Hot Gas and Cold Molecular Gas in M51,"The cold and hot interstellar medium (ISM) in star forming galaxies resembles the reservoir for star formation and associated heating by stellar winds and explosions during stellar evolution, respectively. We utilize data from deep $Chandra$ observations and archival millimeter surveys to study the interconnection between these two phases and the relation to star formation activities in M51 on kiloparsec scales. A sharp radial decrease is present in the hot gas surface brightness profile within the inner 2 kpc of M51. The ratio between the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and the hot gas luminosity ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a positive correlation with the galactic radius in the central region. For the entire galaxy, a twofold correlation is revealed in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ diagram, where $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ sharply increases with $L_{\rm IR}$ in the center but varies more slowly in the disk. The best fit gives a steep relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.82\,{\rm log}(L_{\rm IR} /{L_{\rm \odot}})+22.26$ for the center of M51. The similar twofold correlations are also found in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$molecular line luminosity ($L^\prime_{\rm gas}$) relations for the four molecular emission lines CO(1-0), CO(2-1), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We demonstrate that the core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are the primary source of energy for heating gas in the galactic center of M51, leading to the observed steep $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L^\prime_{\rm gas}$ relations, as their X-ray radiation efficiencies ($\eta$ $\equiv$ $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$/$\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$) increase with the star formation rate surface densities, where $\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$ is the SN mechanical energy input rate.","['Chunyi Zhang', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Tian-Wen Cao']",6.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01613,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['galaxies: hot ISM — galaxies: individual (M51) — galaxies: molecules — galaxies: infrared 1'],2025-01-06
Photometric Determination of Unresolved Main-sequence Binaries in the Pleiades: Binary Fraction and Mass Ratio Distribution,"Accurate determination of binary fractions ($f_{\rm b}$) and mass ratio ($q$) distributions is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the analysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric determination of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable mass ratio can be down to the $q_{\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar mass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes of Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the Pleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member, deriving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass ($\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS) single stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the Pleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary properties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \pm 0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This distribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an exponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 < q < 0.8$, but with a deficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary distribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of primordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the observational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\rm lim} (\mathcal{M}_1)$.","['Rongrong Liu', 'Zhengyi Shao', 'Lu Li']",14.0,21.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01617,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],AJ,,['Open star clusters (1160) —Binary stars (154) — Mass ratio (1012) — Bayesian statistics (1900) 1'],2025-01-06
Cosmological constraints from the Minkowski functionals of the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample,"For the first time, we develop a simulation-based model for the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of large-scale structure, which allows us to extract the full information available from the MFs (including both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian part), and apply it to the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. Our model is based on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the \textsc{Abacus}\textsc{Summit} simulations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which include the redshift-space distortions and Alcock-Paczynski distortions, incorporate survey realism, including survey geometry and veto masks, and account for angular plus radial selection effects. The cosmological and HOD parameter dependence of the MFs is captured with a neural network emulator trained from the galaxy mocks with various cosmological and HOD parameters. To benchmark the constraining power of the MFs, we also train an emulator for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) using the same pipeline. Having validated our approach through successful parameter recovery tests on both internal and external mocks, including non-HOD forward models of the halo-galaxy connection, we apply our forward model to analyze the CMASS data in the redshift range $0.45<z<0.58$. We find the MFs provide stronger constraints on the cosmological parameters than the 2PCF. The combination of the two gives $\omega_{\rm cdm}=0.1172^{+0.0020}_{-0.0023}$, $\sigma_8=0.783\pm 0.026$, and $n_s=0.966^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$, which are tighter by a factor of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6 than the 2PCF alone. The derived constraint $f\sigma_8=0.453 \pm 0.016$ is also improved by a factor of 1.9, compared to the 2PCF, and agrees well with Planck 2018 predictions and other results from a series of studies in the literature.","['Wei Liu', 'Enrique Paillas', 'Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro', 'Georgios Valogiannis', 'Wenjuan Fang']",15.0,51.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01698,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-06

Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids,"Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories.

The ESO SupJup Survey IV. Unveiling the carbon isotope ratio of GQ Lup B and its host star,"The carbon isotope ratio ($^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$) is a potential tracer of giant planet and brown dwarf formation. The GQ Lup system, hosting the K7 T Tauri star GQ Lup A and its substellar companion GQ Lup B, offers a unique opportunity to investigate this ratio in a young system. We aim to characterise the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, determining its temperature, chemical composition, spin, surface gravity, and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$, while also measuring the same ratio for its host star, GQ Lup A. High-resolution K-band spectra of GQ Lup were obtained using CRIRES+ at the VLT. We modelled the starlight contribution from GQ Lup A and fitted GQ Lup Bś spectrum with atmospheric models from petitRADTRANS. The $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio for GQ Lup A was derived using isotope-sensitive PHOENIX models. Atmospheric analysis of GQ Lup B revealed abundances of H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, along with a C/O ratio of $0.50 \pm 0.01$, consistent with the solar value. The carbon isotope ratio was measured as $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 53^{+7}_{-6}$ for GQ Lup B and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C} = 51^{+10}_{-8}$ for GQ Lup A. Strong veiling of the photospheric lines of GQ Lup A was identified and accounted for. The similar $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ values in GQ Lup A and B suggest a common origin from a shared material reservoir, supporting formation via disc fragmentation or gravitational collapse.","['D.

AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1,"A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.","['Jingbo Sun', 'Hengxiao Guo', 'Minfeng Gu', 'Ya-Ping Li', 'Yongjun Chen', 'D.

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) and its prototype phases,"Multi-messenger astronomy is key today to broaden our understanding of the high energy Universe. When an ultra-high energy (UHE) particle interacts in the atmosphere or underground, it initiates an extensive air shower that produces a coherent radio emission in the 50-200 MHz range. The GRAND project is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles (cosmic rays, gamma rays and especially neutrinos) that will consist of 200,000 radio antennas deployed over 20 different locations each of $\sim$ 10,000 $\rm km^2$. In its current phase, it consists of 3 prototypes running autonomously in 3 different locations: GRAND@Auger in Argentina, GRAND@Nançay in France and GRANDProto300 in China, all at commissioning stage. The first goal of these pathfinders is to demonstrate the viability of the GRAND detection concept. GRANDProto300 will also propose a rich science case, by allowing the study of the transition between galactic and extra-galactic cosmic ray sources. In the following, we present the detection concept, the preliminary designs and layout and the ongoing developments of the experiment.",['Marion Guelfand'],2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01851,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],Proceedings of the VHEPU Session - Conference Rencontres de Moriond 2024,,[],2025-01-06
A review of long lasting activities of the central engine of gamma-ray bursts,"Gamma-ray bursts are known to display various features on top of their canonical behavior. In this short review, we will describe and discuss two of them: the ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, which are defined by an extreme duration of their prompt phase, and the plateau phase, which is defined by a steady phase of large duration at the start of the afterglow. We will review the main properties of those two phenomena, and will discuss their possible origin, in light of the standard fireball model of gamma-ray bursts. A final section will discuss the future missions which could bring new evidences to the study of those objects.",['Bruce Gendre'],3.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01857,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-Ray Bursts'],2025-01-06
Glitches and glitching clusters in rotation-powered pulsars,"The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.","['Pei-Xin Zhu', 'Xiao-Ping Zheng']",8.0,17.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01862,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,"The Astrophysical Journal, 978:49 (13pp), 2025 January 01",['pulsars: general – stars: neutron – methods: statistical 1'],2025-01-06
Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges,"Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.","['J.S. Castellanos Durán', 'A.

Early steep optical decay linked to reverse shock for GRB200131A,"We observed an optical afterglow of GRB 200131A obtaining the first photometric point 63 s after the satellite trigger. This early observation shows a steep decay, suggesting either internal engine activity or a reverse shock. By fitting this data set, we show that the early data fit well as a reverse shock component of the GRB afterglow modeled as a thin shell expanding into a constant density interstellar matter. The fitting also shows a good agreement with a catalogued Milky Way galactic extinction and leaves only little space for further extinction in the host galaxy. By judging several factors we conclude that the most likely redshift of this GRB is 0.9 +/- 0.1.","['Martin Jelínek', 'Filip Novotný', 'Sylvio Klose', 'Bringfried Stecklum', 'Alžběta Maleňáková', 'Jan Štrobl']",4.0,6.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01893,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['photometry', 'Gamma-ray bursts']",2025-01-06
Very high energy cosmic ray particles from the Kerr black hole at the galaxy center,"Conventional general relativity supplies the notion of a vacuum tension and thus a maximum force $F_{max}=c^4/4G\approx\ 3\times 10^{43}$ Newtons, that is realized for a black hole.

H$\alpha$-X-ray Surface Brightness Correlation for Filaments in Cooling Flow Clusters,"Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($<$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.","['Valeria Olivares', 'Adrien Picquenot', 'Yuanyuan Su', 'Massimo Gaspari', 'Marie-Lou Gendron-Marsolais', 'Fiorella L.

Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723,"We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 44{,}800 \pm 1200$, surface gravity $\log g = 4.89 \pm 0.18$, and helium abundance $\log N({\rm He})/N({\rm H}) = -0.84 \pm 0.29$) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically-derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's RGB stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N V $\lambda 1240$ doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass ($\sim 1.2 \, M_{\odot}$) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.",['William V.

Exoplanet Detection via Differentiable Rendering,"Direct imaging of exoplanets is crucial for advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system, but it faces significant challenges due to the high contrast between host stars and their planets. Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits. Our results showcase how the computational advancements enabled by differentiable rendering can revitalize previously underexploited wavefront data, opening new avenues for enhancing exoplanet imaging and characterization.","['Brandon Y.

Lyman-alpha resonant-line radiative transfer in expanding media,"The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information about both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming regions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our work complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about nonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future subgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.","['Aaron Smith', 'Kevin Lorinc', 'Olof Nebrin', 'Bing-Xin Lao']",15.0,19.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01928,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['Line: profiles – radiative transfer – methods: analytical – methods: numerical 1 INTRODUCTION The Lyman 𝛼(Ly𝛼) transition of neutral hydrogen is a powerful probeofthephysicalconditionsanddynamicalprocessesingalaxies across cosmic time (Partridge & Peebles 1967)'],2025-01-06
Identification of the interstellar 1-cyano propargyl radical (HCCCHCN) in TMC-1,"We report the first detection in interstellar medium of the 1-cyano propargyl radical, HC$_3$HCN. This species is an isomer of the 3-cyano propargyl radical (CH$_2$C$_3$N), which was recently discovered in TMC-1. The 1-cyano propargyl radical was observed in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey, which is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. A total of seven rotational transitions with multiple hyperfine components were detected in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range. We derived a column density of (2.2$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of 7$\pm$1\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$HCN and CH$_2$C$_3$N is 1.4. The almost equal abundance of these isomers indicates that the two species may be produced in the same reaction with a similar efficiency, probably in the reaction C + CH$_2$CHCN and perhaps also in the reaction C$_2$ + CH$_3$CN and the dissociative recombination with electrons of CH$_2$C$_3$NH$^+$","['C.

Hybrid-z: Enhancing Kilo-Degree Survey bright galaxy sample photometric redshifts with deep learning,"We employ deep learning (DL) to improve photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 Bright galaxy sample (KiDS-Bright DR4). This dataset, used as a foreground for KiDS lensing and clustering studies, is flux-limited to $r<20$ mag with mean $z=0.23$ and covers 1000 deg$^2$. Its photo-$z$s were previously derived with artificial neural networks from the ANNz2 package, trained on the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopy. Here we considerably improve over these previous redshift estimations by building a DL model, Hybrid-z, which combines four-band KiDS images with nine-band magnitudes from KiDS+VIKING. The Hybrid-z framework provides photo-$z$s for KiDS-Bright, with negligible mean residuals of O($10^{-4}$) and scatter at the level of $0.014(1+z)$ -- reduction by 20% over the previous nine-band derivations with ANNz2. We check our photo-$z$ model performance on test data drawn from GAMA, as well as from other KiDS-overlapping wide-angle spectroscopic surveys, namely SDSS, 2dFLenS, and 2dFGRS. We find stable behavior and consistent improvement over ANNz2 throughout. We finally apply Hybrid-z trained on GAMA to the entire KiDS-Bright DR4 sample of 1.2 million galaxies. For these final predictions, we design a method of smoothing the input redshift distribution of the training set, to avoid propagation of features present in GAMA, related to its small sky area and large-scale structure imprint in its fields. Our work paves the way towards the best-possible photo-$z$s achievable with machine learning for any galaxy type both for the final KiDS-Bright DR5 data and for future deeper imaging, such as from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.","['Anjitha John William', 'Priyanka Jalan', 'Maciej Bilicki', 'Wojciech A.

Dwarf Galaxies in the TNG50 Field: connecting their Star-formation Rates with their Environments,"The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 <{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})<9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. The way this phenomenon results from the dwarfs' halo properties or their locations in the large-scale structure is not well understood. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the Illustris TNG50 simulation across different environments, focusing on the dwarfs having host halos with virial masses $9 < {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) < 11.5$, which we demonstrate are in the field as opposed to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We quantify the field dwarfs' large-scale environmental using the tidal index $\Theta_1$ and the distance to the nearest massive galaxy ${\rm d_{massive}}$, and we study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories are correlated with these metrics. Those with ${\rm d_{massive}}>1.5$ Mpc and $\Theta_1<0$ are well isolated, with only $\sim 1\%$ being quenched. The quenched field dwarfs are in majority the backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and pre-processed dwarfs in denser environments.","['Joy Bhattacharyya', 'Annika H.

Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-Rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563,"We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 years of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8-months-long event in 2023 that caused a >40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. TESS photometry suggests a coherent 14.842-hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances.

Abundant Water from Early Supernovae at Cosmic Dawn,"Primordial (or Pop III) supernovae were the first nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the heavy elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Water, in particular, is thought to be crucial to the cosmic origins of life as we understand it, and recent models have shown that water can form in low-metallicity gas like that present at high redshifts. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the first water in the Universe formed in Pop III core-collapse and pair-instability supernovae at redshifts $z \sim$ 20. The primary sites of water production in these remnants are dense molecular cloud cores, which in some cases were enriched with primordial water to mass fractions that were only a factor of a few below those in the Solar System today. These dense, dusty cores are also likely candidates for protoplanetary disk formation. Besides revealing that a primary ingredient for life was already in place in the Universe 100 - 200 Myr after the Big Bang, our simulations show that water was likely a key constituent of the first galaxies.","['Daniel J.

"The SLACS strong lens sample, debiased. II. Lensing-only constraints on the stellar IMF and dark matter contraction in early-type galaxies","The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) is the best studied sample of strong lenses to date. Much of our knowledge of the SLACS lenses has been obtained by combining strong lensing with stellar kinematics constraints. However, interpreting stellar kinematics data is difficult: it requires reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a galaxy and the orbits of its stars. In this work we pursued an alternative approach to the study of galaxy structure with SLACS, based purely on gravitational lensing data. The primary goal of this study is to constrain the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter $\alpha_{sps}$, quantifying the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and that obtained with a reference stellar population synthesis model, and the efficiency of the dark matter response to the infall of baryons, $\epsilon$. We combined Einstein radius measurements from the SLACS lenses with weak lensing information from their parent sample, while accounting for selection effects. The data can be fit comparatively well by a model with $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0.22$ and $\epsilon=0$, corresponding to an IMF slightly lighter than Salpeter and no dark matter contraction, or $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0$ and $\epsilon=0.8$, equivalent to a Chabrier IMF and almost maximal contraction. This degeneracy could be broken with lensing-only measurements of the projected density slope, but existing data are completely inconsistent with our model. We suspect systematic errors in the measurements to be at the origin of this discrepancy. Number density constraints would also help break the degeneracy. Because of selection effects, SLACS lenses have a larger velocity dispersion than galaxies with the same projected mass distribution, and their velocity dispersion is overestimated. These two biases combined produce a $5\%$ upward shift in the observed velocity dispersion.",['Alessandro Sonnenfeld'],11.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02054,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,"['Gravitational lensing: strong - Galaxies: elliptical and lenticular', 'cD - Galaxies: fundamental parameters 1']",2025-01-07
Upper Limits on the Mass of Cool Gas in the CGM of Dwarf Galaxies,"We use HI absorption measurements to constrain the amount of cool ($\approx 10^4$ K), photoionized gas in the CGM of dwarf galaxies with $M_* = 10^{6.5-9.5}~M_\odot$ in the nearby Universe ($z<0.3$). We show analytically that volume-filling gas gives an upper limit on the gas mass needed to reproduce a given HI column density profile. We introduce a power-law density profile for the gas distribution and fit our model to archival HI observations to infer the cool CGM gas mass, $M_{\rm cCGM}$, as a function of halo mass. For volume-filling ($f_V=1$) models, we find $M_{\rm cCGM} = 5 \times 10^8-2 \times 10^9~M_\odot$, constituting $\lesssim 10\%$ of the halo baryon budget. For clumpy gas, with $f_V=0.01$, the masses are a factor of $\approx 11$ lower, in agreement with our analytic approximation. Our assumption that the measured HI forms entirely in the cool CGM provides a conservative upper limit on $M_{\rm cCGM}$, and possible contributions from the IGM or warm/hot CGM will further strengthen our result. We estimate the mass uncertainties due to the range of redshifts in our sample and the unknown gas metallicity to be $\approx 15\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. Our results show that dwarf galaxies have only $\lesssim 15\%$ of their baryon budget in stars and the cool CGM, with the rest residing in the warm/hot CGM or ejected from the dark matter halos.","['Yakov Faerman', 'Yong Zheng', 'Benjamin D.

Revisiting the Group-Dominant Elliptical NGC 5044 in the Radio Band: Continuum Emission and Detection of HI Absorption,"We present new MeerKAT L-band (continuum and HI) and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (300-850 MHz) observations of the archetypal cool-core group-dominant early-type galaxy NGC 5044. Our new continuum images reveal diffuse, steep spectrum ($\alpha_{0.99\,\rm GHz}^{1.56\,\rm GHz}=-1.53\pm0.6$) radio emission extending about 25 kpc around the unresolved radio core. The observed radio emission overlaps with the known X-ray cavities, but is not confined to them. We also find the first direct evidence of neutral atomic gas in NGC 5044, in the form of a 3.8$\sigma$ significant two-component HI absorption line seen against the emission of the active nucleus. The peak velocities are well correlated with the previously reported CO(2-1) absorption, but the HI lines are moderately broader, spanning velocities from $265\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$ to $305\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$. We do not detect HI emission, but place an upper limit of $M_{HI}< 5.4 \times 10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$ in the central 15 arcsec (2.2 kpc) of the galaxy. This is significantly less than the estimated molecular gas content, and implies a molecular-to-atomic mass ratio of $\geq $1.7:1, consistent with these gas phases forming through cooling from the hot intra-group medium. We also constrain the spin temperature to $T_{\rm spin}\leq 950\,\rm K$, indicating that the detected HI is in the cold neutral phase.","['Kamlesh Rajpurohit', 'Tirna Deb', 'Konstantinos Kolokythas', 'Kshitij Thorat', ""Ewan O'Sullivan"", 'Gerrit Schellenberger', 'Laurence P.

Statistical trends in JWST transiting exoplanet atmospheres,"Our brains are hardwired for pattern recognition as correlations are useful for predicting and understanding nature.

Here we present a framework for comparing exoplanet transmission spectroscopy from 3 to 5$\mu$m with four bands: L (2.9 - 3.7$\mu$m), SO$_2$ (3.95 - 4.1$\mu$m), CO$_2$ (4.25 - 4.4$\mu$m) and CO (4.5 - 4.9$\mu$m). Together, the four bands cover the major carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-bearing molecules including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and CO. Among the eight high-precision gas giant exoplanet planet spectra we collected, we found strong correlations between the SO$_2$-L index and planet mass (r=-0.41$\pm$0.09) and temperature (r=-0.64$\pm$0.08), indicating SO$_2$ preferably exists (SO$_2$-L$>$-0.5) among low mass ($\sim<$0.3M$_J$) and cooler ($\sim<$1200K) targets. We also observe strong temperature dependency for both CO$_2$-L and CO-L indices. Under equilibrium chemistry and isothermal thermal structure assumptions, we find that the planet sample favors super-solar metallicity and low C/O ratio ($<$0.7). In addition, the presence of a mass-metallicity correlation is favored over uniform metallicity with the eight planets. We further introduce the SO$_2$-L versus CO$_2$-L diagram alike the color-magnitude diagram for stars and brown dwarfs. All reported trends here will be testable and be further quantified with existing and future JWST observations within the next few years.","['Guangwei Fu', 'Kevin B. Stevenson', 'David K.

Retracing the Cold Plasma Dispersion Law in Pulsar B0329+54: New Insights into Frequency-Dependent Dispersion Measures,"Multiple studies have investigated potential frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DM) in PSR B0329+54, with sensitivities at levels of $10^{-3} \, \text{pc} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ or higher, using frequencies below 1 GHz. Utilizing the extensive bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, we conducted simultaneous observations of this pulsar across a frequency range of 300 to 1460 MHz. Our observations reveal a distinct point in the pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with the cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the entire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival (ToAs) from widely adopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT)-leads to frequency-dependent DMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in this pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry corresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in the range 300-1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the dipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is centered at $\sim$800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the size of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given frequencies, and it is at least five times more stringent than the existing emission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.","['Shyam S.

JOYS: The [D/H] abundance derived from protostellar outflows across the Galactic disk measured with JWST,"The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]$=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.","['L. Francis', 'E. F. van Dishoeck', 'A.

Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Transients,"Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. When calculating the properties of the images we expect to see from these lenses, it is typically assumed that each lens is roughly a singular isothermal sphere. In reality, the largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. Focusing on gravitational waves, we compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, as seen elsewhere in the literature. This significant deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of lenses through time domain transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.","['Luka Vujeva', 'Jose María Ezquiaga', 'Rico K.

"Using LSDB to enable large-scale catalog distribution, cross-matching, and analytics","The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate an unprecedented volume of data, including approximately 60 petabytes of raw data and around 30 trillion observed sources, posing a significant challenge for large-scale and end-user scientific analysis. As part of the LINCC Frameworks Project we are addressing these challenges with the development of the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and analysis package LSDB (Large Scale Database). HATS partitions data adaptively using a hierarchical tiling system to balance the file sizes, enabling efficient parallel analysis. Recent updates include improved metadata consistency, support for incremental updates, and enhanced compatibility with evolving datasets. LSDB complements HATS by providing a scalable, user-friendly interface for large catalog analysis, integrating spatial queries, crossmatching, and time-series tools while utilizing Dask for parallelization. We have successfully demonstrated the use of these tools with datasets such as ZTF and Pan-STARRS data releases on both cluster and cloud environments.

Cross validation of albedo determination for 1627 Ivar from three different techniques,"Near Earth Asteroids are of great interest to the scientific community due to their proximity to Earth, making them both potential hazards and possible targets for future missions, as they are relatively easy to reach by spacecraft. A number of techniques and models can be used to constrain their physical parameters and build a comprehensive assessment of these objects. In this work, we compare physical property results obtained from improved $H_V$ absolute magnitude values, thermophysical modeling, and polarimetry data for the well-known Amor-class NEO 1627 Ivar. We show that our fits for albedo are consistent with each other, thus demonstrating the validity of this cross-referencing approach, and propose a value for Ivar's albedo of $0.24^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ . Future observations will extend this work to a larger sample size, increasing the reliability of polarimetry for rapid asteroid property characterization, as a technique independent of previously established methods and requiring significantly fewer observations.","['Elena Selmi', 'M.

The Lack of RR Lyrae Variables in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Sextans II,"RR Lyrae in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, if found, would be valuable to constrain the distances of these UFD. In this work, we report our search of RR Lyrae in a recently discovered UFD -- Sextans II. Based on multiband ($griz$) time-series archival DECam imaging data, we do not find any RR Lyrae in Sextans II. On the contrary, the sparse multiband DECam light curves allowed recovery of a known foreground RR Lyrae, BB Sex, which happened to fall within the DECam images, and its pulsation period was correctly identified. Therefore, it is possible that Sextans II lacks RR Lyrae, similar to several other fainter UFDs (with $M_V \gtrsim -5.0$~mag) that do not have RR Lyrae.","['Chow-Choong Ngeow', 'Anupam Bhardwaj']",7.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02160,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,[],2025-01-07
Differentiating the acceleration mechanisms in the slow and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind,"In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second, and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface, before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly than a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfvén wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfvénicity that suggest Alfvén waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfvénic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds Alfvénic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfvénic slow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below Parker's orbit.","['Yeimy J.

ALMA 0.1 pc View of Molecular Clouds Associated with High-Mass Protostellar Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Are Low-Metallicity Clouds Filamentary or Not?,"Filamentary molecular clouds are an essential intermediate stage in the star formation process. To test whether these structures are universal throughout cosmic star formation history, it is crucial to study low-metallicity environments within the Local Group. We present an ALMA analysis of the ALMA archival data at the spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc for 17 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z $\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$). This sample represents approximately 30% of the YSOs confirmed by Spitzer spectroscopy. Early ALMA studies of the SMC have shown that the CO emission line traces an H$_2$ number density of $\gtrsim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, an order of magnitude higher than in the typical Galactic environments. Using the CO($J$ = 3-2) data, we investigated the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular clouds. Our analysis shows that about 60% of the clouds have steep radial profiles from the spine of the elongated structures, while the remaining clouds have a smooth distribution and are characterized by lower brightness temperatures. We categorized the former as filaments and the latter as non-filaments. Some of the filamentary clouds are associated with YSOs with outflows and exhibit higher temperatures, likely reflecting their formation conditions, suggesting that these clouds are younger than non-filamentary ones. This indicates that even if filaments form during star formation, their steep structures may become less prominent and transit to a lower-temperature state. Such transitions in structure and temperature have not been reported in metal-rich regions, highlighting a key behavior for characterizing the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation in low-metallicity environments.","['Kazuki Tokuda', 'Yuri Kunitoshi', 'Sarolta Zahorecz', 'Kei E.

"MOA-2022-BLG-033Lb, KMT-2023-BLG-0119Lb, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896Lb: Three low mass-ratio microlensing planets detected through dip signals","We examined the anomalies in the light curves of the lensing events MOA-2022-BLG-033, KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896. We conducted detailed modeling of the light curves to uncover the nature of the anomalies. This modeling revealed that all signals originated from planetary companions to the primary lens. The planet-to-host mass ratios are very low: $q\sim 7.5\times 10^{-5}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-033, $q\sim 3.6\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and $q\sim 6.9\times 10^{-5}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-1896. The anomalies occurred as the source passed through the negative deviation region behind the central caustic along the planet-host axis. The solutions are subject to a common inner-outer degeneracy, resulting in variations in estimating the projected planet-host separation. For KMT-2023-BLG-1896, although the planetary scenario provides the best explanation of the anomaly, the binary companion scenario is marginally possible. We estimate the physical parameters of the planetary systems through Bayesian analyses based on the lensing observables. The analysis identifies MOA-2022-BLG-033L as a planetary system with an ice giant, approximately 12 times the mass of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-1896L is also an ice giant, with a mass around 16 Earth masses, orbiting a mid-K-type main-sequence star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-0119L, which has a mass about the mass of Saturn, orbits a mid-K-type dwarf star. The lens for MOA-2022-BLG-033 is highly likely to be located in the disk, whereas for the other events, the probabilities of the lens being in the disk or the bulge are roughly comparable.","['Cheongho Han', 'Ian A.

A Critical Reanalysis of Supernova Type Ia Data,"Cosmological parameter fitting remains crucial, especially with the abundance of available data. While many parameters have been tightly constrained, discrepancies-most notably the Hubble tension-persist between measurements obtained from different observational datasets. In this paper, we re-examine the Pantheon supernova dataset to explore deviations in the distribution of distance modulus residuals from the Gaussian distribution, which is typically the underlying assumption. We do this analysis for the concordant cosmological constant model and for a variety of dynamical dark energy models. It has been shown earlier that the residuals in this dataset are better fit to a logistic distribution. We compare the residual distributions assuming both Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods on the complete dataset, as well as various subsets of the data. The results, validated through various statistical tests, demonstrate that the Logistic likelihood provides a better fit for the full dataset and lower redshift bins, while higher redshift bins fit Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods similarly. Furthermore, the findings indicate a preference for a cosmological constant model. However analysing individual surveys within the Pantheon dataset reveals inconsistencies among subsets. The level of agreement between surveys varies depending upon the underlying likelihood function.","['Ramanpreet Singh', 'Athul C N', 'H.K.

"A Comprehensive Catalog of Emission-line Nebulae, Star Clusters, and Supergiants in M31 from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey","Spectroscopic observations of various tracers in nearby galaxies, such as Andromeda (M31), play a crucial role in identifying and classifying individual stellar populations and nebular objects, thereby enhancing our understanding of galactic composition, environment, and dynamics as well as stellar evolution. While the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope) survey of M31 has produced extensive datasets, a comprehensive catalog of emission-line nebulae, star clusters, and supergiants is yet to be completed. In this paper, we present a final catalog of 384 emission-line nebulae, 380 star clusters, and 375 supergiants and candidates in M31, as carefully selected and identified from the LAMOST spectroscopic database. These objects were classified using a random forest algorithm, followed by thorough visual examinations of their spectral characteristics as well as morphologies revealed by archive images. For emission-line nebulae, we measured radial velocities and relative fluxes of emission lines, enabling further classification of planetary nebulae and HII regions. Additionally, we identified 245 emission-line nebulae in M33.

Planetary Edge Trends (PET). I. The Inner Edge-Stellar Mass Correlation,"The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.","['Meng-Fei Sun', 'Ji-Wei Xie', 'Ji-Lin Zhou', 'Beibei Liu', 'Nikolaos Nikolaou', 'Sarah C.

Tracking Star-Forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles,"Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars, and the impact of turbulence, is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2, 10$. Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2$ model. In the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.","['Shingo Nozaki', 'Hajime Fukushima', 'Kazuki Tokuda', 'Masahiro N.

Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical,"The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.","['Sanket Wavhal', 'Pawan Kumar', 'Bidya Binay Karak']",8.0,20.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02262,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,['Solar dynamo'],2025-01-07
TOI-6038 A b: A dense sub-Saturn in the transition regime between the Neptunian ridge and savanna,"We present the discovery and characterization of a sub-Saturn exoplanet, TOI-6038~A~b, using the PARAS-2 spectrograph. The planet orbits a bright ($m_V=9.9$), metal-rich late F-type star, TOI-6038~A, with $T_{\rm{eff}}=6110\pm100~\mathrm{K}$, $\log{g}=4.118^{+0.015}_{-0.025}$, and $[{\rm{Fe/H}}]=0.124^{+0.079}_{-0.077}$ dex. The system also contains a wide-orbit binary companion, TOI-6038~B, an early K-type star at a projected separation of $\approx3217$ AU. We combined radial velocity data from PARAS-2 with photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for joint modeling. TOI-6038~A~b has a mass of $78.5^{+9.5}_{-9.9}~M_\oplus$ and a radius of $6.41^{+0.20}_{-0.16}~R_\oplus$, orbiting in a circular orbit with a period of $5.8267311^{+0.0000074}_{-0.0000068}$ days. Internal structure modeling suggests that $\approx74\%$ of the planet's mass is composed of dense materials, such as rock and iron, forming a core, while the remaining mass consists of a low-density H/He envelope. TOI-6038~A~b lies at the transition regime between the recently identified Neptunian ridge and savanna. Having a density of $\rho_{\rm{P}}=1.62^{+0.23}_{-0.24}\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$, TOI-6038~A~b is compatible with the population of dense ridge planets ($\rho_{\rm{P}}\simeq$ 1.5-2.0 $\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$), which have been proposed to have reached their close-in locations through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HEM). First-order estimates suggest that the secular perturbations induced by TOI-6038~B may be insufficient to drive the HEM of TOI-6038~A~b. Therefore, it is not clear whether HEM driven by a still undetected companion, or early disk-driven migration, brought TOI-6038~A~b to its present-day close-in orbit. Its bright host star makes TOI-6038~A~b a prime target for atmospheric escape and orbital architecture observations, which will help us to better understand its overall evolution.","['Sanjay Baliwal', 'Rishikesh Sharma', 'Abhijit Chakraborty', 'K.

The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1,"The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.","['Durgesh Tripathi', 'A. N.

Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter,"The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.","['Philippe Brax', 'Patrick Valageas']",16.0,21.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02297,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Pattern Formation and Solitons'],,,[],2025-01-07
Lorentz force mediation of turbulent dynamo transitions,"We investigate how the strength of the Lorentz force alters stellar convection zone dynamics in a suite of buoyancy-dominated, three-dimensional, spherical shell convective dynamo models. This is done by varying only the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's electrical conductivity $\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic field and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid motions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo generation all differ across the $0.25 \leq Pm \leq 10$ range investigated here. For example, we show that strong magnetohydrodynamic effects cause a fundamental change in the surface zonal flows: differential rotation switches from solar-like (prograde equatorial zonal flow) for larger electrical conductivities to an anti-solar differential rotation (retrograde equatorial zonal flow) at lower electrical conductivities. This study shows that the value of the bulk electrical conductivity is important not only for sustaining dynamo action, but can also drive first-order changes in the characteristics of the magnetic, velocity, and temperature fields. It is also associated with the relative strength of the Lorentz force in the system as measured by the local magnetic Rossby number, $Ro_\ell^M$, which we show is crucial in setting the characteristics of the large-scale convection regime that generates those dynamo fields.","['Krista M.

Concept camera for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys,"Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift identify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.","['Attila Kovács', 'Garrett Keating', 'Timothy Norton']",1.0,10.0,10.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02329,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'Astrophysics of Galaxies']",,"Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 13102, id. 1310207 10 pp. (2024)","['integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy', 'far-infrared instrumentation', 'line intensity mapping', 'volu- metric galaxy survey', 'imaging spectroscopy 1', 'cos mological star-formation survey', 'cosmic star-formation history']",2025-01-07
Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654,"We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $<30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.","['Sibasish Laha', 'Eileen T.

As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly.

Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%.

Multi-wavelength Emission of Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Phase. II. Spectral Polarimetry,"Polarization spectra had been predicted within the photosphere model. For the purpose of seeking more clues to distinguish between the models, both the time-resolved and time-integrated polarization spectra from optical band to MeV gamma-rays of the magnetic reconnection model are studied here. There are two newly found differences between the two models. First, the time-integrated polarization degree (PD) of the magnetic reconnection model would in general increase with frequency for on-axis observations, while it is not monotonous for the photosphere model. Second, the variations of both the time-integrated and the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic reconnection model is not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly with frequency for the photosphere model. Therefore, future energy-resolved polarization analysis could distinguish between the two models. In addition, the PA rotation spectra are studied for the first time. The rotation value of PA within the burst duration will decrease with the increase of the observational energy band. Most significant PA rotation would happen for slightly off-axis observations in each energy band. The PA would rotate even for on-axis observations in optical band. Compared with the aligned magnetic field case, the PA rotation is quite rare in the gamma-ray band for the case with a toroidal field in the radiation region.","['Jia-Sheng Li', 'Mi-Xiang Lan']",12.0,19.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02397,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-ray bursts (629)'],2025-01-07

VLT VIMOS Integral Field Spectroscopy of the nova remnant FH Ser,"FH Ser experienced a slow classical nova outburst in February 1970 that was the first one observed at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. Its nova remnant is elliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament along its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D spatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to assess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that reveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate ellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most prominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities of 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with respect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the ring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main ellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy of 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser with similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane, most likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of integral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to disentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical structure.","['M.A. Guerrero', 'E.

Global 21 cm signal: a promising probe of primordial features,"Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k > k^{\rm turn}$ and $k < k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} < k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] < 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.","['Suvedha Suresh Naik', 'Pravabati Chingangbam', 'Saurabh Singh', 'Andrei Mesinger', 'Kazuyuki Furuuchi']",15.0,30.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02538,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Theory'],,,[],2025-01-07
Investigating the Redshift Evolution of Lensing Galaxy Density Slopes via Model-Independent Distance Ratios,"Strong lensing systems, expected to be abundantly discovered by next-generation surveys, offer a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy evolution. The connection between galaxy structure and cosmology through distance ratios highlights the need to examine the evolution of lensing galaxy mass density profiles. We propose a novel, dark energy-model-independent method to investigate the mass density slopes of lensing galaxies and their redshift evolution using an extended power-law (EPL) model. We employ a non-parametric approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained on Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data to reconstruct distance ratios of strong lensing systems. These ratios are compared with theoretical predictions to estimate the evolution of EPL model parameters. Analyses conducted at three levels, including the combined sample, individual lenses, and binned groups, ensure robust and reliable estimates. A negative trend in the mass density slope with redshift is observed, quantified as $\partial\gamma/\partial z = -0.20 \pm 0.12$ under a triangular prior for anisotropy. This study demonstrates that the redshift evolution of density slopes in lensing galaxies can be determined independently of dark energy models. Simulations based on LSST Rubin Observatory forecasts, which anticipate 100,000 strong lenses, show that spectroscopic follow-up of just 10 percent of these systems can constrain the redshift evolution coefficient with uncertainty ($\Delta\partial\gamma/\partial z$) to 0.021. This precision distinguishes evolving and non-evolving density slopes, providing new insights into galaxy evolution and cosmology.","['Shuaibo Geng', 'Margherita Grespan', 'Hareesh Thuruthipilly', 'Sreekanth Harikumar', 'Agnieszka Pollo', 'Marek Biesiada']",16.0,16.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02577,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['galaxy evolution – strong gravitational lensing 1'],2025-01-07
Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: I. Generalized Ambartsumian (1937) approach and the family of power-law distributions of eccentricity,"The orbital parameter space of wide, weakly bound binary stars has been shaped by the still poorly known circumstances of their formation, as well as by subsequent dynamical evolution in parent clusters and in the field. The advance of the Gaia mission astrometry takes statistical studies of wide stellar systems to an unprecedented level of precision and scope. On the theoretical side of the problem, the old approach proposed by Jeans and developed by Ambartsumian is revisited here. It is shown how certain simplifying assumptions about the phase density of binary systems in the framework of general copula distributions can lead to a family of analytical representations for the marginal distribution of orbital eccentricity, including accommodating and flexible power-law models. We further demonstrate the application of these models in forward Monte Carlo simulations of the measured motion angles between the relative velocity and separation vectors on the example of 170K listed Gaia binary systems, providing inference in the intrinsic distribution of orbital eccentricity.",['Valeri V.

Parametrization Framework for the Deceleration Parameter in Scalar Field Dark Energy Model,"We propose a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with a scalar field that represents dark energy. A new parametrization of the deceleration parameter is introduced of the form $q = 1 + \eta (1 + \mu a^{\eta})$ where $\eta$ and $\mu$ are model parameters. and the compatibility of the model is constrained by recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ and Baryon Acoustic Observations. By considering a variable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the universe, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the model are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison is then made with the $\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We examine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and equation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal insights into what has been dubbed ""dynamical dark energy"" under the assumptions made above. Our method provides a framework that is independent of the model to explore dark energy, leading to a deeper and more subtle understanding of the mechanisms driving late-time cosmic acceleration.",['Aroonkumar Beesham'],9.0,19.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02592,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[': Cosmological model'],2025-01-07
Variation of global and local flows in the solar convection zone during activity cycles 24 and 25,"Convection, differential rotation, and meridional circulation of solar plasma are studied based on helioseismic data covering the period from May 2010 to August 2024, significantly prolonged compared to that previously considered. Depth variation in the spatial spectrum of convective motions indicates a superposition of differently scaled flows. The giant-cell-scale component of the velocity field demonstrates a tendency to form meridionally elongated (possibly bananashaped) structures. The integrated spectral power of the flows is anticorrelated with the solar-activity level in the near-surface layers and positively correlates with it in deeper layers. An extended 22-year cycle of zonal flows (""torsional oscillations"" of the Sun) and variations of the meridional flows are traced.

Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions,"Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.",['Anne M.

The quest for a stable disk,"The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. Toomre claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal mass halo, to be a notable counter-example, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations due to complicated non-linear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise-driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.","['J A Sellwood', 'R G Carlberg']",10.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02636,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Spiral galaxies (1560) — Galaxy structure (622) — Galaxy dynamics ( 591) — Galaxy evolution (594) 1'],2025-01-07

The outburst-fragmentation events can lead to a runaway process where the increasing spin rate, driven by outgassing torques, results in repeated mass loss, until the sublimating body completely disintegrates.","['Jane Luu', 'David Jewitt']",6.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02645,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Comets (251) — Solar system (1736) 1'],2025-01-07
Testing disc reprocessing models for AGN optical variability by comparison of X-ray and optical power spectra of NGC 4395,"It is generally thought that AGN optical variability is produced, at least in part, by reprocessing of central X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc, resulting in wavelength-dependent lags between bands. Any good model of AGN optical variability should explain not only these lags, but also the overall pattern of variability as quantified by the power spectral density (PSD). Here we present $\sim$daily g'-band monitoring of the low-mass AGN NGC\,4395 over 3 years. Together with previous TESS and GTC/HiPERCAM observations we produce an optical PSD covering an unprecedented frequency range of $\sim7$ decades allowing excellent determination of PSD parameters. The PSD is well fitted by a bending power law with low-frequency slope $\alpha_{L} = 1.0 \pm 0.2$, high-frequency slope $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$ and bend timescale $3.0^{+6.6}_{-1.7}\,$\,d. This timescale is close to that derived previously from a damped random walk (DRW) model fitted to just the TESS observations, although $\alpha_{L}$ is too steep to be consistent with a DRW. We compare the observed PSD with one made from light curves synthesized assuming reprocessing of X-rays, as observed by \xmm and Swift, in a disc defined by the observed lags. The simulated PSD is also well described by a bending power law but with a bend two decades higher in frequency. We conclude that the large-amplitude optical variations seen on long-timescales are not due to disc reprocessing but require a second source of variability whose origin is unknown but could be propagating disc accretion rate variations.","['Max Beard', 'Ian McHardy', 'Keith Horne', 'Edward Cackett', 'Federico Vincentelli', 'Juan Venancio Hernandez Santisteban', 'Jake Miller', 'Vikram Dhillon', 'Johan Knapen', 'Stuart Littlefair', 'Daniel Kynoch', 'Elmé Breedt', 'Yue Shen', 'Jonathan Gelbord']",17.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02664,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['galaxies:active – galaxies:individual:NGC 4395 – X-rays:galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have long been observed to emit X-ray continua that vary rapidly and non-periodically (e'],2025-01-07
The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits,"Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.","['Huan-rong Yuan', 'Ying Wang', 'Xin Wu', 'Ji-wei Xie', 'Hui-gen Liu', 'Ji-lin Zhou', 'Wei Sun']",17.0,20.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02717,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['Solar-planetary interactions (1472) — Hot Jupiters(753) — Exoplanet evo- lution(491) 1'],2025-01-07
Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane,"The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a non-parametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with experimental observations within the uncertainty. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.","['Jiayin He', 'Houdun Zeng', 'Yi Zhang', 'Qiang Yuan', 'Rui Zhang', 'Jun Li']",5.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02720,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,['Gamma-ray astronomy (628)'],2025-01-07
Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge,"We have detected the 10 um silicate feature and the 11.3 um crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic Bulge. The depths of the 10 um feature indicate highly-obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the Spectral Energy Distributions of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The sixteen sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relation, associated with the Long Secondary Period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially-enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g. OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1-0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially-enhanced.","['Steven R.

On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model,"The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy (Clauser, Parker) for the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the wind channel area, which is described precisely by Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models for the solar wind.",['Bhimsen Shivamoggi'],0.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02731,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,[],2025-01-07
Probing the Merger Rates of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies with Gravitational Waves,"The mergers of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key drivers of galaxy evolution, contributing to the growth of both galaxies and their central black holes. Current projects like Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and upcoming missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin are designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by SMBH binaries during their inspiral and merger phases. We investigate the capability to probe the merger rates of SMBHs and their host galaxies by combining current PTA detections and mock GW data for LISA-like detectors, while incorporating observational constraints from the $M_{\bullet}-M_*$ relationship and galaxy stellar mass functions. Our findings highlight the critical role of GW detections with LISA-like detectors in exploring the merger rates of galaxies and SMBHs and the timescale of SMBH mergers. Additionally, incorporating PTA constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background further refines model parameters and reduces uncertainties. Gravitational wave detections offer an independent method for estimating galaxy merger rates, providing a valuable consistency check against rates derived from galaxy pair observations and cosmological simulations. Furthermore, comparing SMBH mass assembly through mergers with growth via accretion provides key insights into the evolutionary history of SMBHs, with the timescale of SMBH binary mergers playing a significant role in shaping their merger rates and merger mass assembly.","['Yun Fang', 'Rong-Gen Cai']",8.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02748,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['gravitational waves – supermassive black holes – galaxies – merger rate – methods: Bayesian inference 1 INTRODUCTION Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the centers ofmassivegalaxies'],2025-01-07
A Scenario for Origin of Global 4 mHz Oscillations in Solar Corona,"We establish a spherically symmetric model of solar atmosphere, which consists of the whole chromosphere and low corona below the $1.25$ solar radius. It is a hydrodynamic model with heating in the chromosphere through an artificial energy flux. We performed a series of simulations with our model and found oscillations with a peak frequency of $\sim$4 $\rm{mHz}$ in the power spectrum. We confirmed that this resulted from the $p$-mode excited in the transition region and amplified in a resonant cavity situated in the height range $\sim$$4\times10^3$--$2\times10^4$ km. This result is consistent with global observations of Alfvénic waves in corona and can naturally explain the observational ubiquity of $4\ \rm{mHz}$ without the difficulty of the $p$-mode passing through the acoustic-damping chromosphere. We also confirmed that acoustic shock waves alone cannot heat the corona to the observed temperature, and found mass upflows in the height range $\sim$$7\times10^3$--$7\times10^4$ km in our model, which pumped the dense and cool plasma into the corona and might be the mass supplier for solar prominences.","['Li Xue', 'Cheng-Liang Jiao', 'Li-Xin Zhang']",8.0,21.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02753,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics'],2025-01-07
Polarimetric Study of GRS 1915+105: Estimation of Interstellar Polarization Component,"GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds.

Testing General Relativity using Large Scale Structures Photometric Redshift Surveys and Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing Effect,"The $E_G$ statistic provides a valuable tool for evaluating predictions of General Relativity (GR) by probing the relationship between gravitational potential and galaxy clustering on cosmological scales within the observable universe. In this study, we constrain the $E_G$ statistic using photometric redshift data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) MagLim sample in combination with the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing map. Unlike spectroscopic redshift surveys, photometric redshift measurements are subject to significant redshift uncertainties, making it challenging to constrain the redshift distortion parameter $\beta$ with high precision. We adopt a new definition for this parameter, $\beta(z) = {f\sigma_8(z)}/{b\sigma_8(z)}$. In this formulation, we reconstruct the growth rate of structure, $f\sigma_8(z)$, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) method, while simultaneously utilizing model-independent constraints on the parameter $b\sigma_8(z)$, directly obtained from the DES collaboration. After obtaining the angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$ (galaxy-galaxy) and $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$ (galaxy-CMB lensing) from the combination of DES photometric data and Planck lensing, we derive new measurements of the $E_G$ statistic: $E_G = 0.354 \pm 0.146$, $0.452 \pm 0.092$, $0.414 \pm 0.069$, and $0.296 \pm 0.069$ (68$\%$ C.L.) across four redshift bins: $z = 0.30, 0.47, 0.63$, and $0.80$, respectively, which are consistent with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we forecast the $E_G$ statistic using future photometric redshift data from the China Space Station Telescope, combined with lensing measurements from the CMB-S4 project, indicating an achievable constraint on $E_G$ of approximately 1$\%$, improving the precision of tests for GR on cosmological scales.","['Shang Li', 'Jun-Qing Xia']",6.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02852,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,ApJS,,['Large-scale structure of the universe (902)'],2025-01-07
High-temperature measurements of acetylene VUV absorption cross sections and application to warm exoplanet atmospheres,"Most observed exoplanets have high equilibrium temperatures. Understanding the chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires the use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal dependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of molecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to uncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to study experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of molecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for use in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured absorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773 K recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical model, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot Jupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of C2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115 to 185 nm and rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2 calculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of 40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at 773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher in the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase in the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the abundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4). We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV absorption cross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures. Similar studies of other major species are needed to improve our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.","['Benjamin Fleury', 'Mathilde Poveda', 'Yves Benilan', 'Roméo Veillet', 'Olivia Venot', 'Pascal Tremblin', 'Nicolas Fray', 'Marie-Claire Gazeau', 'Martin Schwell', 'Antoine Jolly', 'Nelson de Oliveira', 'Et-touhami Es-sebbar']",11.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02864,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,"A&A, 693, A82 (2025)",['Astrochemistry – Molecular data – Methods: laboratory: molecular – Techniques: spectroscopic – Planets and satellites: atmospheres 1'],2025-01-07
Revealing the internal magnetic field configuration of magnetars via their associated periodic signals,"The magnetic deformation of magnetars is affected by their internal magnetic fields, which are generally difficult to be measured directly through observations. In this work, the periodic pulse-phase modulations in the hard X-ray emissions of the magnetars 4U 0142+61, 1E 1547.0-5408, SGR 1900+14, and SGR 1806-20, and the periodicities of fast radio bursts (FRBs) 180916 and 121102 are interpreted as free precession of the (host) magnetars. Using these periodic signals, we investigate the magnetars' internal magnetic fields. In order to simultaneously account for the modulation periods and surface thermal emissions of the former four magnetars, and require that their internal poloidal fields smoothly connect with the surface dipole fields, the parameter that characterizes the distribution of toroidal field in the magnetar interior should satisfy $\beta\gtrsim1$. Moreover, their volume-averaged strengths of poloidal and toroidal fields are respectively $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\sim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\sim10^{15}$ G with the strength ratios $\bar{B}_{\rm t}/\bar{B}_{\rm p}$ generally distributing within $\sim2$--$37$. We could also constrain the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity in the neutron-star core considering that the former four magnetars are probably precessing, and the most stringent constraint is $T_{\rm c,core}<6.4\times10^8$ K. Adopting a possible critical temperature $T_{\rm c,core}=5\times10^8$ K, we could obtain $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G for the host magnetars of FRBs 180916 and 121102, which indicates that the magnetars of our interest possibly have similar poloidal and toroidal fields.","['Jie Shu', 'Quan Cheng', 'Xiao-Ping Zheng']",3.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02887,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Theory'],PRD,,[],2025-01-07
Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a non-canonical pseudo-scalar,"A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-scalar. We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the inflaton.","[""Jun'ya Kume"", 'Marco Peloso', 'Nicola Bartolo']",4.0,28.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02890,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-07
Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation,"Aims. Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically-formed - or, 'three-body' - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory.Methods. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using the 3.5PN equations of motion. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.Results. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically-active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. We obtain a local rate of GW captures of $\mathcal{R}(z\simeq0)\rm\simeq1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$, as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also find that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions are very wide and not likely to merge via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations because they quickly break up in subsequent interactions with BHs and BBHs. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs","['Daniel Marín Pina', 'Mark Gieles', 'Tomas Andrade', 'Alessandro A.

The puzzle of isolated and quenched dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids,"We report, for the first time, the detection of a sample of quenched and isolated dwarf galaxies (with 8.9 $<$ log(M$_{\rm \star}$/M$_{\rm \odot}$) $<$ 9.5) in the least dense regions of the cosmic web, including voids, filaments, and walls. These dwarfs have no neighbouring galaxy within 1.0~Mpc in projected distance. Based on the full spectral fitting of their central spectra using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, these galaxies are gas-deprived, exhibit stellar mass assembly very similar to dwarfs in the central regions of galaxy clusters, and have experienced no significant star formation in the past 2 Gyr. Additionally, analysis of r-band images from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey showed that these dwarf galaxies host a central Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC). Detecting quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids indicates that environmental factors are not the sole drivers of their quenching. Internal mechanisms, such as feedback from in-situ star formation, also contributing to the NSC formation, black holes, or variations in conditions during their formation, offer potential explanations for star formation suppression in these galaxies.

Searches for primary photons and neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory,"The Pierre Auger Observatory stands as the largest detector for ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays. The Observatory is also sensitive to UHE photons and neutrinos that can be produced along with UHE cosmic rays or in top-down processes, such as the decay of dark matter particles. The search for these neutral particles relies on the hybrid measurements of extensive air showers, combining a fluorescence detector with a surface detector array and an underground muon detector. We present an overview of the searches for UHE photons and neutrinos utilizing data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Currently, no photon or neutrino candidates have been identified. Consequently, we report on the most stringent limits to the integral UHE photon and neutrino fluxes above 50 PeV and 100 PeV, respectively, from diffuse and point-like steady sources. These limits led to strong constraints on theoretical models describing the cosmological evolution of the acceleration sites and the nature of dark-matter particles. Lastly, we briefly comment on the searches for these neutral particles in coincidence with gravitational wave events, underscoring the pivotal role of the Observatory in the context of multi-messenger astronomy at the highest energies.",['Nicolás M.

Challenges in identifying the coronal hole wind,"Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source region. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the scheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton plasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible explanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in the scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole wind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind at the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole wind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a comparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an unsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that the scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow solar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means classification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first of which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is dominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind from low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because during this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was observed. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification needs to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the phase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification of the solar wind.","['Verena Heidrich-Meisner', 'Sophie Teichmann', 'Lars Berger', 'Robert F.

Evolution of the S\'ersic Index up to z=2.5 from JWST and HST,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR Sérsic index ($n$), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range $0.5\leq z\leq2.5$. We infer rest-frame near-IR Sérsic profiles for $\approx 15.000$ galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical Sérsic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median Sérsic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies ($M_\star > 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$), which show an increase from $n\approx 2.5$ to $n\approx 4$ at $z<1$. High-mass galaxies have higher $n$ than lower-mass galaxies ($M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at $z>1$. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR $n$ at z>1 (but not at z<1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At $z>1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$ is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.","['Marco Martorano', 'Arjen van der Wel', 'Maarten Baes', 'Eric F.

Gaussian process regression of temperature-dependent radial velocities,"Gaussian processes (GPs) described by quasi-periodic covariance functions have in recent years become a widely used tool to model the impact of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements. We perform a GP regression analysis on solar RV time series measured from spectral segments formed at different temperatures within the photosphere in order to evaluate the relation between the best-fit GP kernel hyperparameters and the observed activity signal as a function of temperature. The posterior distributions of the hyperparameters show subtle differences between high- and low-activity phases and as a function of the spectral formation temperature range, which could have implications on the characteristics of the activity signal and its optimal modelling. For the temperature-dependent RVs, we find that at high and low activity alike, the minimal RV dispersion is obtained at intermediately cool temperature ranges (4000-4750 K), for both the observed and GP model-subtracted RVs. Finally, we compare and correlate our temperature-dependent RVs with RV components derived from disk-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun, for which we find a consistently strong correlation between RVs related to hotter temperature ranges and the dominant RV component due to the inhibition of convection.","['Federica Rescigno', 'Khaled Al Moulla']",5.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02959,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,MNRAS,,"['Sun: activity – techniques: radial velocities – methods: statistical 1 INTRODUCTION In the last three decades', '000 different exoplanets and have contributed to characterising the masses of thousands more', 'from gas giants to rocky planets', 'radial velocity (RV) analyses have suc- cessfully detected more than 1']",2025-01-07
Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations,"Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.","['Di Luo', 'Yan-Heng Yu', 'Jun-Peng Li', 'Sai Wang']",5.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02965,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-07
Resolving the mass transfer in the symbiotic recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis,"T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with an 80-year recurrence interval whose next eruption is imminent. We aim to resolve the accretion mechanism of the binary system governing the mass transfer during its super-active phase. Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we analyze the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity. We perform Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the system's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find evidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the super-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The accretion disc is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its maximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation energies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright spot at the stream impact on the accretion disc outer radius, the irradiation at the red-giant facing side, the stream-disc overflow, the accretion disk wind, and an expanding bipolar nebula. The bipolar jet emerged at the rise of the super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years. The temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure from quiescence started in the disc, likely triggered by a disc instability similar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass accretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further enhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase. Conclusions. Symbiotic recurrent novae, such as T CrB, are governed by similar mass-transfer mechanisms as found in cataclysmic variables despite their different orbital properties (longer orbital periods imposing larger accretion discs) and evolutionary pathways.","['L.

ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution,"A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a non-parametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage Graphics Processing Unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real-time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor for upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g. the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky-background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.","['Yashil Sukurdeep', 'Tamás Budavári', 'Andrew J.

An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline,"The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, the current Kepler catalog exhibits insufficient reliability for long-period low signal-to-noise planets due to systematic false alarms caused by correlated and non-Gaussian noise. As a result, it remains hard to measure the occurrence rate of such planets.We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small (Kepler MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve the occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. It provides a tail-less background distribution with a rate of $\sim$1 false alarm per search for MES$\sim$7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of 7.5-9 and $>$4 transits due to the background distribution control.We conducted a search on the entirety of Kepler data, applying permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of planetary origin for every candidate.

"An accurate and simple, asymptotically matched deprojection of the Sersic law","The Sersic law reproduces very well the surface brightness profile of early-type galaxies, and therefore is routinely used in observational and theoretical works. Unfortunately, its deprojection can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions for generic values of the shape parameter $n$. Over the years, different families of approximate deprojection formulae have been proposed, generally based on fits of the numerical deprojection over some radial range. We searched for a very simple, accurate, and theoretically motivated deprojection formula of the Sersic law, without free parameters, not based on fits of the numerical deprojection, and holding for generic $n > 1$. The formula has been found by requiring it to reproduce the analytical expressions for the inner and outer asymptotic expansions of the deprojected Sersic law of given $n$, and by matching the two expansions at intermediate radii with the request that the total luminosity coincides with that of the original Sersic profile of same $n$. The resulting formula is algebraically very simple, by construction its inner and outer parts are the exact (asymptotic) deprojection of the Sersic law, and it depends on two coefficients that are analytical functions of $n$ of immediate evaluation. The accuracy of the formula over the whole radial range is very good and increases for increasing $n$, with maximum relative deviations from the true numerical deprojection of $\simeq 8\,10^{-3}$ for the de Vaucouleurs profile. In the Appendix, the extension of the proposed formula to profiles with $n <1$ is also presented and discussed. The formula obtained is a useful tool of simple use in the modeling of early-type galaxies. Its ellipsoidal generalization is immediate.","['L. Ciotti', 'L. De Deo', 'S.

Shear-gravity transition determines the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in molecular clouds: confronting analytical formula with observations,"The velocity dispersion-size relation is a crucial indicator of the dynamic properties of interstellar gas. Recent observations reveal a steep velocity dispersion-size relation ($\sigma_{\rm v}\sim R^{\beta}$) with the index $\beta> 0.6$, which cannot be explained by a single mechanism with only gravity ($\beta\sim0.5$) or shear ($\beta \sim 1$). We present a two-component model $\sigma_{\rm v_{mixture}} = \lambda_1 \sigma_{\rm v_{g}} + \lambda_2 \sigma_{\rm v_{shear}} = A[(GM/R)^{\frac{1}{2}} + f(R/t_{\rm shear})]$ to explain the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in the observation from e.g. Miville et al. (2017) and Zhou et al. (2022). We find that the velocity dispersion of small clouds is mainly caused by self-gravity, while large clouds are primarily affected by shear, and these two regimes are linked by a gradual transition with a transition scale $\sim100$ pc. The variation of cloud velocity dispersion with the Galactocentric distance results from the variation of both cloud internal density structure and Galactic shear. Our two-component model captures how the dynamics of the molecular gas can be affected by both internal and external factors, and we expect it to be applied to data from galaxies with different physical conditions to reveal the physics.","['Yi-Heng Xie', 'Guang-Xing Li']",9.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03027,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,APJL,,['Milky Way Galaxy(1054) — Galaxy dynamics(591) — Interstellar medium(847) — In- terstellar dynamics(839) — Molecular clouds(1072) — Galaxy rotation(618) — Scaling relations(2031) 1'],2025-01-07
Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes,"Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a ""boom"" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n>1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}","['G.

Electrostatic instability of non-spherical dust in sub-stellar clouds,"Charged dust clouds play an important role in the evolution of sub-stellar atmospheres through electrical discharges such as lightning events or inter-grain discharges. The consequent plasma activation presents an alternative source of disequilibrium chemistry, potentially triggering a set of chemical reactions otherwise energetically unavailable. The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the electrostatic stability of charged spheroidal dust grains in sub-stellar clouds and its impact on inter-grain electrostatic discharges, the available area for atmospheric gas-phase surface chemistry, the particle eccentricity distribution function and observed polarization signatures. This paper has derived the criterion for the allowed values of dust eccentricity that are electrostatically stable as a function of grain size $a\in[0.2,1.8]~\mu$m, floating potential $\phi_{f}\in[1, 10]$~V and tensile strength $\Sigma_{s}=10^{3}$~Pa. As a consequence of electrostatic instability we also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal poles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the particle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of polarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be electrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical value will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to spheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform surface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible to electrostatic instability. In this context electrostatic erosion presents a mechanism that may produce bumpy, irregularly shaped or porous grains.","['Craig R. Stark', 'Declan A. Diver', 'Matthew I.

Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes,"Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.",['Antonio Junior Iovino'],7.0,283.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03065,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,"['Inflation', 'Primordial Black Holes', 'Cosmology', 'Gravity Waves', 'Dark Matter']",2025-01-07
Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 5 September 2022 SEP Event,"On September 5, 2022, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.","['A.

Solar variability in the Mg II h and k lines,"Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability of Mg II h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg II index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, Mg II index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg II index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover the climate relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg II index and its variability based on the well-established SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg II index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize Mg II index timeseries on climate relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the timeseries of the Mg II index spanning nearly three centuries.","['K.

A two-hump spectrum in the prompt emission of GRB 240825A,"An extra hard spectral component that extends to GeV energies, in additional to the typical sub- MeV Band component, appears in several gamma-ray burst (GRBs) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescopes (LAT). Only in one case (i.e., GRB 090926A), a spectral break feature at the high energy end is identified in the extra hard component, but the photon counts are not enough to distinguish between the cutoff model and the broken power law model for the spectral break. In this work, we report the detection of an extra hard component showing the spectral break in GRB 240825A. We find that a broken power-law model fits the spectral data of the extra component better than a single power-law with an exponential cutoff in the time resolved spectrum for the second emission pulse, with a break at about 50 MeV. This spectral feature disfavors the gamma-ray opacity to pair creation as the origin of the spectral break, but points to an intrinsic peak for the extra component. The low ratio between the peak of the extra hard component and that of the Band component challenges the synchrotron self-Compton origin for the extra component. Alternative scenarios, such as the inverse Compton scattering of the photosphere emission, are discussed. In addition, we find a clear transition from the prompt emission to afterglow emission at GeV energies in GRB 240825A, manifested by a temporal steep decay and an unique spectral evolution.","['Hai-Ming Zhang', 'Zi-Qi Wang', 'Cui-Yuan Dai', 'Yi-Yun Huang', 'Ruo-Yu Liu', 'En-Wei Liang', 'Xiang-Yu Wang']",5.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03082,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gamma-ray bursts (629) — High energy astrophysics (739)) 1'],2025-01-07
Spectra of standing kink waves in loops and the effects of the lower solar atmosphere,"Understanding the effects of the lower solar atmosphere on the spectrum of standing kink oscillations of coronal loops, in both the decaying and decayless regime, is essential for developing more advanced tools for coronal seismology. We aim to reveal the effects of the chromosphere on the spatial profiles and frequencies of the standing kink modes, create synthetic emission maps to compare with observations, and study the results using spatial and temporal coronal seismology techniques. We excited transverse oscillations in a 3D straight flux tube using (a) a broadband footpoint driver, (b) a sinusoidal velocity pulse, and (c) an off-centre Gaussian velocity pulse, using the PLUTO code. The flux tube is gravitationally stratified, with footpoints embedded in chromospheric plasma. Using the FoMo code, we created synthetic observations of our data in the Fe IX 17.1 nm line and calculated the spectra with the Auto-NUWT code. We also numerically solved the generalised eigenvalue system for the 1D wave equation to determine the effects of the stratification on the kink modes of our system. The synthetic observations of the loops perturbed by the velocity pulses show a single dominant mode that our 1D analysis reveals to be the third harmonic of the system. For the broadband driver, the synthetic emission shows multiple frequency bands, associated with both the loop and the driver. Finally, using seismological techniques, we highlight the possibility of misidentifying the observed third, sixth, and ninth harmonics with the first, second, and third harmonics of the coronal part of longer loops. Unless more advanced techniques of spatial seismology are used with many data points from observations along the entire loop length, this misidentification can result in overestimating the mean magnetic field by a factor equal to the period ratio of the fundamental over the third harmonic.","['Konstantinos Karampelas', 'Daye Lim', 'Tom Van Doorsselaere', 'Yuhang Gao']",9.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03089,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['magnetohydrodynamics - solar coronal seismology - solar coronal waves - magnetohydrodynamical simulations 1'],2025-01-07
The coronal power spectrum from MHD mode conversion above sunspots,"Sunspots are intense regions of magnetic flux that are rooted deep below the photosphere. It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic waves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic (or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition layer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate upwards into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfvénic modes in the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the resulting power spectra of coronal Alfvénic waves. A broadband wave source is used that has a 1D power spectrum which mimics aspects of the observed p-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode conversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the upwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a gravitationally stratified atmosphere, and plays a key role in shaping the power spectra of mode converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow, fast magnetoacoustic waves and Alfvén waves above the equipartition layer have similarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver spectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have a peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This matches observations of coronal Alfvénic waves and further supports the role of mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfvénic wave generation in the Sun's atmosphere.","['Hemanthi Miriyala', 'Richard J.

The NewAthena mission concept in the context of the next decade of X-ray astronomy,"Large X-ray observatories such as Chandra and XMM-Newton have been delivering scientific breakthroughs in research fields as diverse as our Solar System, the astrophysics of stars, stellar explosions and compact objects, accreting super-massive black holes, and large-scale structures traced by the hot plasma permeating and surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. The recently launched observatory XRISM is opening in earnest the new observational window of non-dispersive high-resolution spectroscopy. However, several quests are left open, such as the effect of the stellar radiation field on the habitability of nearby planets, the Equation-of-State regulating matter in neutron stars, the origin and distribution of metals in the Universe, the processes driving the cosmological evolution of the baryons locked in the gravitational potential of Dark Matter and the impact of supermassive black hole growth on galaxy evolution, just to mention a few. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is a key player in multi-messenger astrophysics. Addressing these quests experimentally requires an order-of-magnitude leap in sensitivity, spectroscopy and survey capabilities with respect to existing X-ray observatories.

Cloudy-Maraston: Integrating nebular continuum and line emission with the Maraston stellar population synthesis models,"The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H$\rm \beta$, H$\rm \alpha$, [N II]$\lambda 6583$, and [S II]$\lambda 6731$ luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II$\lambda$1640 and [O III]$\lambda 5007$, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of $\hat{Q}_{\rm [O III]\lambda 5007} = \rm 6 \times 10^9 \; s^{-1} \, M_{\odot}^{-1}$, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.","['Sophie L.

Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet,"The Beta Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We perform an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carry out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we have found that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.","['A. Lacquement', 'H. Beust', 'V. Faramaz-Gorka', 'G.

Quantifying the detection likelihood of faint peaks in interferometric data through jackknifing: Test application on finding $z>10$ galaxy candidates,"False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying $z\sim3-4$ passive galaxies as $z>10$ galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of $z>10$ galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, $jackknify$, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these $z>10$ galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.","['Joshiwa van Marrewijk', 'Melanie Kaasinen', 'Gergö Popping', 'Luca Di Mascolo', 'Tony Mroczkowski', 'Leindert Boogaard', 'Francesco Valentino', 'Tom Bakx', 'Ilsang Yoon']",10.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03150,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,"['galaxies:high-redsfhits – galaxies:individual:S5-z17-1', 'Glass-z10 – techniques:interferometric 1', 'Glass-z12']",2025-01-07
"Pseudo-Newtonian simulation of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordstr\""om naked singularity","We present the first numerical simulations of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordström (RN) naked singularity (a charged point mass). The gravity of the RN naked singularity is modeled with a pseudo-Newtonian potential that reproduces exactly the radial dependence of the RN Keplerian orbital frequency; in particular, orbital angular velocity vanishes at the zero gravity radius and has a maximum at 4/3 of that radius. Angular momentum is transported outwards by viscous stresses only outside the location of this maximum. Nonetheless, even at that radius, accretion proceeds at higher latitudes, the disk having thickened there owing to excess pressure. The accretion stops at a certain distance away from the singularity, with the material accumulating in a toroidal structure close to the zero-gravity sphere. The shape of the structure obtained in our simulations is reminiscent of fluid figures of equilibrium analytically derived in full general relativity for the RN singularity. The presence of a rotating ring, such as the one found in our simulations, could be an observational signature of a naked singularity. For charge to mass ratios close to but larger than unity, the inner edge of the quasi-toroidal inner accretion structure would be located well within the Schwarzschild marginally stable orbit (ISCO), and the maximum orbital frequency in thin accretion disks would be much higher than the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency.","['Miljenko Čemeljić', 'Włodek Kluźniak', 'Ruchi Mishra', 'Maciek Wielgus']",4.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03178,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Gravitational singularities 1'],2025-01-07
Superhabitable Planets Around Mid-Type K Dwarf Stars Enhance Simulated JWST Observability and Surface Habitability,"In our search for life beyond the Solar System, certain planetary bodies may be more conducive to life than Earth. However, the observability of these `superhabitable' planets in the habitable zones around K dwarf stars has not been fully modeled. This study addresses this gap by modeling the atmospheres of superhabitable exoplanets. We employed the 1D model $\texttt{Atmos}$ to define the superhabitable parameter space, $\texttt{POSEIDON}$ to calculate synthetic transmission spectra, and $\texttt{PandExo}$ to simulate $\text{JWST}$ observations. Our results indicate that planets orbiting mid-type K dwarfs, receiving $80\%$ of Earth's solar flux, are optimal for life. These planets sustain temperate surfaces with moderate $CO_2$ levels, unlike those receiving $60\%$ flux, where necessarily higher $CO_2$ levels could hinder biosphere development. Moreover, they are easier to observe, requiring significantly fewer transits for biosignature detection compared to Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. For instance, detecting biosignature pairs like oxygen and methane from $30$ parsecs would require $150$ transits ($43$ years) for a superhabitable planet, versus over $1700$ transits ($\sim 1700$ years) for Earth-like planets. While such observation times lie outside of $\text{JWST}$ mission timescales, our study underscores the necessity of next-generation telescopes and provides valuable targets for future observations with, for example, the $\text{ELT}$.","['Iva Vilović', 'Jayesh Goyal', 'René Heller', 'Fanny Marie von Schauenburg']",16.0,30.0,4900.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03214,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['Director ’s Discretionary Time', 'astrobiology -- methods: numerical -- stars: K dwarfs Abbr eviations: DDT']",2025-01-07
No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times,"Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as $z \simeq 14$, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. It has also been discovered that fairly massive galaxies existed at early times, a finding again viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this simple model matches the observed galaxy UV LF over the redshift range $z \simeq 6-13$ and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at $z \simeq 6-8$. When combined with new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency of early galaxies, our model also predicts the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observational constraints. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, and our model only works if the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond $z \simeq 6$. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at $z \simeq 15$. A key prediction of our model is thus that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the numbers of galaxy number density beyond $z \simeq 15$, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.","['C.

The Variable X-ray Emission of the Cataclysmic Variable V1460 Her with a Rapidly Rotating White Dwarf,"Using a recent Chandra ACIS observation of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) V1460 Her (2MASS J16211735+4412541) with a fast-rotating ($P_{\rm spin} = 38.9$~s) white dwarf, we estimated a flux $F_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}}^{\rm abs} = (1.9\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\sim7$ lower than found from previous Swift XRT observations $\approx8$ years ago, when the CV was quiescent.

Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals,"Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike ""dry EMRIs"", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.","['Zhenwei Lyu', 'Zhen Pan', 'Junjie Mao', 'Ning Jiang', 'Huan Yang']",5.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03252,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-08
Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars,"Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$.

High count rate effects in event processing for XRISM/Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter: I. Ground test,"The spectroscopic performance of an X-ray microcalorimeter is compromised at high count rates. In this study, we utilize the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the XRISM satellite to examine the effects observed during high count rate measurements and propose modeling approaches to mitigate them. We specifically address the following instrumental effects that impact performance: CPU limit, pile-up, and untriggered electrical cross talk. Experimental data at high count rates were acquired during ground testing using the flight model instrument and a calibration X-ray source. In the experiment, data processing not limited by the performance of the onboard CPU was run in parallel, which cannot be done in orbit. This makes it possible to access the data degradation caused by limited CPU performance. We use these data to develop models that allow for a more accurate estimation of the aforementioned effects. To illustrate the application of these models in observation planning, we present a simulated observation of GX 13+1.

Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories with transdimensional models,Modeling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters.

Decameter-sized Earth impactors -- I: Orbital properties,"Numerous decameter-sized asteroids have been observed impacting Earth as fireballs. These objects can have impact energies equivalent to hundreds of kilotons of TNT, posing a hazard if they impact populated areas. Previous estimates of meteoroid flux using fireball observations have shown an Earth impact rate for decameter-size objects of about once every $2$-$3$ years. In contrast, telescopic estimates of the near-Earth asteroid population predict the impact rate of such objects to be of order $20$-$40$ years, an order-of-magnitude difference. While the cause of this discrepancy remains unclear, tidal disruption of a larger near-Earth body has been proposed as an explanation for these excess decameter-sized impactors. The release in 2022 of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data for fireball events has provided a wealth of new information on many of these impacts. Using this newly available USG sensor data, we present the first population-level study characterizing the orbital and dynamical properties of 14 decameter-sized Earth impactors detected by USG sensors since 1994, with a particular focus on searching for evidence of tidal disruption as the cause of the impact rate discrepancy. We find there is no evidence for recent ($\lesssim 10^4$ years) tidal disruption and weak evidence for longer-term tidal disruption in the decameter impactor population, but that the latter conclusion is limited by small number statistics. We also investigate the origins of both the impactor and near-Earth asteroid populations of decameter-sized objects from the main asteroid belt. We find that both populations generally originate from the same source regions: primarily from the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\sim70$%) with small contributions from the Hungaria group ($\sim20$%) and the 3:1 Jupiter mean-motion resonance ($\sim10$%).","['Ian Chow', 'Peter G.

Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters,"I hypothesize a physical explanation for the ""Little Red Dots"" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.",['Jillian Bellovary'],2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03309,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['High-redshift galaxies(734) — Intermediate-mass black holes(816) — Galaxy forma- tion(595) — Tidal disruption(1696) — Active galactic nuclei(16) 1'],2025-01-08
Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient,"Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.",['Antonio C.

Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients,"Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.","['Daichi Tsuna', 'Wenbin Lu']",9.0,23.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03316,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-08
On stellar hotspots due to star-planet magnetic interactions: How much power can actually be transmitted to the chromosphere?,"Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism for generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of $10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by Alfvén waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates where and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat. The stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of cool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfvén speed over a short distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfvén waves at the transition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency of energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection of the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the stellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the frequency-dependent propagation of Alfvén waves through a realistic background stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of the wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to characterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several candidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected. Low-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency waves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies. Conversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfvén waves substantially diminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result, there exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A significant fraction of the Alfvén wave energy is reflected at the stellar transition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency to the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.","['Arghyadeep Paul', 'Antoine Strugarek', 'Victor Réville']",14.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03320,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics'],Astronomy and Astrophysics,,['1'],2025-01-08

The majority of stars formed closer to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate (z > 1.3) and a great deal of star formation presently occurs in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. These environments are unified by the presence of a high interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). Numerical studies of stellar birth typically neglect this fact, and those that do not have thus far been limited in scope. In this work we present the first comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation in extreme environments where we have increased the ISRF and CRIR to values typical of the CMZ and starburst galaxies. We note changes in the fragmentation behaviour on both the core and stellar system scale, leading to top-heavy core and stellar system mass functions in high ISRF/CRIR clouds. Clouds fragment less on the core scale, producing fewer but more massive cores. Conversely, the cores fragment more intensely and produce richer clusters of stellar systems. We present a picture where high ISRF/CRIR clouds fragment less on the scale of cores and clumps, but more on the scale of stellar systems. The change in fragmentation behaviour subsequently changes the mass function of the stellar systems that form through enhanced accretion rates.","['Matt T. Cusack', 'Paul C. Clark', 'Simon C. O.

A multi-wavelength investigation of spiral structures in $z > 1$ galaxies with JWST,"Recent JWST observations have revealed the prevalence of spiral structures at $z > 1$. Unlike in the local Universe, the origin and the consequence of spirals at this epoch remain unexplored. We use public JWST/NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey to map spiral structures in eight massive ($> 10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. We present a method for systematically quantifying spiral arms at $z>1$, enabling direct measurements of flux distributions. Using rest-frame near-IR images, we construct morphological models accurately tracing spiral arms. We detect offsets ($\sim 0.2 - 0.8\,\rm kpc$) between the rest-frame optical and near-IR flux distributions across most arms. Drawing parallels to the local Universe, we conclude that these offsets reflect the presence of density waves. For nine out of eighteen arms, the offsets indicate spiral shocks triggered by density waves. Five arms have offsets in the opposite direction and are likely associated with tidal interactions. For the remaining cases with no detected offsets, we suggest that stochastic 'clumpy' star formation is the primary driver of their formation. In conclusion, we find a multi-faceted nature of spiral arms at $z > 1$, similar to that in the local Universe.","['Boris S. Kalita', 'Si-Yue Yu', 'John D. Silverman', 'Emanuele Daddi', 'Luis C.

Clumps as multiscale structures in cosmic noon galaxies,"Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich $z>1$ galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive ($>10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) main-sequence galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\sim1.5$ with $\sim0.3\,\rm kpc$ resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is $1-30\%$ towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing $1-20\%$ to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from $0\lesssim\Delta\log\rm sSFR\lesssim 0.4$. They feature star formation surface densities of $10^{-2}-10^{2}\,\rm M_{\odot}/yr/kpc^{2}$, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes ($r_{e}\sim0.1-1\,\rm kpc$) and stellar masses ($\sim 10^{8.0-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$). We estimate a mass-size relation ($r_{e}\propto\rm M_{\star}^{\,0.52\pm0.07}$) along with a stellar mass function (slope, $\alpha=-1.85\pm 0.19$), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in $z\gtrsim1$ lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images.

Identifying Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects through Neutrinos,"Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of 1-100 MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from TŻOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from TŻO candidates (e.g. VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from TŻOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect TŻOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the TŻO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.","['Pablo Martínez-Miravé', 'Irene Tamborra', 'Alejandro Vigna-Gómez']",6.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03330,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-08
The properties of GSN 069 accretion disk from a joint X-ray and UV spectral analysis: stress-testing quasi-periodic eruption models,"We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and XMM-Newton data of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069. Using ultraviolet (UV) and optical images at HST resolution, we show that GSN 069's emission consists of a point source superimposed on a diffuse stellar component. The latter accounts for $\leq 5\%$ of the UV emission in the inner 0.5""$\times$0.5"" region, while the luminosity of the former cannot be attributed to stars. Analyzing the 2014/2018 HST UV spectra, we show that to leading order the intrinsic spectral shape is $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{4/3}$, with $\sim 10\%$ far UV flux variability between epochs. The contemporaneous X-ray and UV spectra can be modeled self-consistently in a thin disk framework. At observed epochs, the disk had an outer radius ($R_{\rm out}$) of $\mathcal{O}(10^3 R_{\rm g})$, and shows both cooling and expansion over the four years. Incorporating relativistic effects via numerical ray tracing, we constrain the disk inclination angle ($i$) to be $30^\circ \lesssim i \lesssim 65^\circ $ and identify a narrow region of spin-inclination parameter space that describes the observations. These findings confirm that GSN 069 hosts a compact, viscously expanding accretion disk likely formed after a TDE. Implications for QPE models are: (i) No published disk instability model can explain the disk's stability in 2014 (no QPEs) and its instability in 2018 (QPEs present); (ii) While the disk size in 2018 allows for orbiter/disk interactions to produce QPEs, in 2014 the disk was already sufficiently extended, yet no QPEs were present. These findings pose challenges to existing QPE models.","['M. Guolo', 'A. Mummery', 'T. Wevers', 'M. Nicholl', 'S. Gezari', 'A. Ingram', 'D. R.

Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope UV observations of an X-ray quasi-periodic eruption source,"X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} > 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).","['Thomas Wevers', 'Muryel Guolo', 'Sean Lockwood', 'Andrew Mummery', 'Dheeraj R.

Multi-Wavelength Analysis of AT 2023sva: a Luminous Orphan Afterglow With Evidence for a Structured Jet,"We present multi-wavelength analysis of ZTF23abelseb (AT 2023sva), an optically discovered fast-fading ($\Delta m_r = 2.2$ mag in $\Delta t = 0.74 $ days), luminous ($M_r \sim -30.0$ mag) and red ($g-r = 0.50$ mag) transient at $z = 2.28$ with accompanying luminous radio emission. AT 2023sva does not possess a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to an isotropic equivalent energy limit of $E_{\rm{\gamma, \, iso}} < 1.6 \times 10^{52}$ erg, determined through searching $\gamma$-ray satellite archives between the last non-detection and first detection, making it the sixth example of an optically-discovered afterglow with a redshift measurement and no detected GRB counterpart. We analyze AT 2023sva's optical, radio, and X-ray observations to characterize the source. From radio analyses, we find the clear presence of strong interstellar scintillation (ISS) 72 days after the initial explosion, allowing us to place constraints on the source's angular size and bulk Lorentz factor. When comparing the source sizes derived from ISS of orphan events to those of the classical GRB population, we find orphan events have statistically smaller source sizes. We also utilize Bayesian techniques to model the multi-wavelength afterglow. Within this framework, we find evidence that AT 2023sva possesses a shallow power-law structured jet viewed slightly off-axis ($\theta_{\rm{v}} = 0.07 \pm 0.02$) just outside of the jet's core opening angle ($\theta_{\rm{c}} = 0.06 \pm 0.02$). We determine this is likely the reason for the lack of a detected GRB counterpart, but also investigate other scenarios. AT 2023sva's evidence for possessing a structured jet stresses the importance of broadening orphan afterglow search strategies to a diverse range of GRB jet angular energy profiles, to maximize the return of future optical surveys.","['Gokul P.

HST Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS0745-191,"We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.","['Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo', 'Hyunseop Choi', 'Minghao Guo', 'Annabelle Richard-Laferrière', 'Carter Rhea', 'Marine Prunier', 'Helen Russell', 'Andy Fabian', 'Jonelle L.

Recent star formation episodes in the Galaxy: impact on its chemical properties and the evolution of its abundance gradient,"We investigate the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disc exploring various schemes of recent (last several Gyr) star formation episodes, as reported in recent observational works. We use a semi-analytical model with parametrized radial migration and we introduce gaussian star formation episodes constrained by those recent observations. We find significant impact of the star formation episodes on several observables, like the local age-metallicity and [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity relations, as well as the local stellar metallicity distribution or the existence of young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars. Moreover, we show that the recently found ""wiggly"" behaviour of the disk abundance gradient with age can be interpreted in terms of either star formation or infall episodes.","['Tianxiang Chen', 'Nikos Prantzos']",7.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03342,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Galaxy: evolution – Galaxy: disk 1'],2025-01-08
Formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes from rings of planetesimals,"The solar system planetary architecture has been proposed to be consistent with the terrestrial and giant planets forming from material rings at ~1 au and ~5 au, respectively. Here, we show that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes may share a similar formation pathway. In our simulations conducted with a disk alpha-viscosity of 4e-3, super-Earths accrete from rings of rocky material in the inner disk, growing predominantly via planetesimal accretion. Mini-Neptunes primarily originate from rings located beyond the water snowline, forming via pebble accretion. Our simulations broadly match the period-ratio distribution, the intra-system size uniformity, and the planet multiplicity distribution of exoplanets. The radius valley constrains the typical total mass available for rocky planet formation to be less than 3-6 Earth masses. Our results predict that planets at ~1 au in systems with close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are predominantly water-rich. Though relatively uncommon, at ~1% level, such systems might also host rocky Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone that underwent late giant impacts, akin to the Moon-forming event.","['Sho Shibata', 'Andre Izidoro']",16.0,22.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03345,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: formation — planets and satellites: terrestrial planets — planets and satellites: atmospheres — methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-08

Our preliminary results include: 1) the axes of MFRs in cycle 25 present a systematic northward orientation, which is the same as in cycle 23 but opposite to cycle 24; 2) the majority of the MFRs occurred near HBs (within 30 degrees) and some exceptional events occurred at non-HBs; 3) the axial fields in MCs present a similar north-south orientation, which changes from cycle to cycle.

Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL\,J2325$-$4111 and SPT-CL\,J0049$-$2440 were optimized using 9, and 8 secure multiple-imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0\farcs63 and 0\farcs73, respectively.

Bulk viscous matter in $f(T)$ gravity: A path to cosmic acceleration,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying bulk viscosity coefficients $\zeta(t)=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}H$ on cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We focus on two cases: (i) $\zeta_{1} \neq0$ and (ii) $\zeta_{1} =0$, deriving the Hubble parameter $H$ as a function of redshift $z$ using a linear $f(T)$ model ($f(T) = \alpha T$ where $\alpha \neq 0$). Using the combined $H(z)+Pantheon^{+}+BAO$ dataset, we obtain observational constraints on model parameters. For Case I ($\zeta_1 \neq 0$), best-fit values are $H_0=60.0^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=1.01^{+0.10}_{-0.098}$, $\zeta_0=40.1^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$, and $\zeta_1=0.123^{+0.093}_{-0.088}$, while for Case II ($\zeta_1 = 0$), they are $H_0=67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=0.94^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and $\zeta_0=34.7^{+2.0}_{-2.0}$. The analysis reveals a transition in the deceleration parameter, indicating a shift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe's expansion, with present-day values of $q_{0} \approx -0.49$ and $q_{0} \approx -0.32$ for the respective cases. The jerk parameter $j(z)$ and effective EoS for the cosmic viscous fluid also support the cosmic acceleration, with trajectories aligning with the quintessence scenario.

Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies,"We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($<3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($>$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.","['Thomas Donlon II', 'Sukanya Chakrabarti', 'Lawrence M.

The nature and origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous based on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio emission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars are detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores, knots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on morphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars as radio-AGN, compared to the $\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the $\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN and the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\sim$60 per cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is likely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no significant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2 quasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest jet powers of $P_\mathrm{jet} \approx \times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few targets, where these measurements were possible. These quasars share characteristics with compact radio-selected populations, and the global radio emission likely traces strong interactions between the AGN (jets/outflows) and their host galaxy ISM from 10s parsec to 10s kiloparsec scales.","['Ann Njeri', 'Chris M.

Strong evidence of low levels of solar activity during the Maunder Minimum,"The Maunder Minimum (MM) was a period of prolonged solar activity minimum between 1645 and 1715. Several works have identified a significant number of problematic spotless days in the MM included in existing databases. We have found a list of exact spotless (in the second half of 1709) and spot days (January and August 1709) provided by Johann Heinrich Muller. We computed the most probable value and upper/lower limits of the active day fraction (ADF) from Muller's data using the hypergeometrical probability distribution. Our sample is not strictly random because Muller recorded observations in consecutive days when he observed sunspots. Therefore, our result represents an upper threshold of solar activity for 1709. We compared this result with annual values of the ADF calculated for the Dalton Minimum and the most recent solar cycles. We concluded that it was less active than most years both in the Dalton Minimum and in the most recent solar cycles. Therefore, the solar activity level estimated in this work for 1709 represents robust evidence of low solar activity levels in the MM.","['V.M.S. Carrasco', 'H. Hayakawa', 'C. Kuroyanagi', 'M.C.

Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations,"We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.","['Mohammad Ali Gorji', 'Misao Sasaki', 'Teruaki Suyama']",3.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03444,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-08
Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?,"We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L>1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.","['Chan-Gyung Park', 'Bharat Ratra']",18.0,29.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03480,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-08
"The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation","We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.","['Z. Prudil', 'A. Kunder', 'L. Beraldo e Silva', 'S. Gough-Kelly', 'M.

The ubiquity of variable radio emission and spin-down rates in pulsars,"Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission stability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are identifying an increasing number that deviate from this preconceived notion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we investigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 radio pulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, over the past three decades. We found 238 pulsars display significant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit changes in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this represents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and indicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The intensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar spin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may have substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in the ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in explaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient profile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.","['M. E. Lower', 'A.

Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations,"Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple-lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple-source, and 8.8% have a multiple-lens and a multiple-source. The majority of these events have photometric lightcurves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens-binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for singles and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of singles and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE (arXiv:1707.07634) than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.","['Natasha S.

The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database,"We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys.

Real-time RFI Excision Techniques and their Limitations,"Contemporary real-time RFI mitigation is carried out at different stages primarily using regulatory and technical approaches. Regulatory approaches include spectrum management, radio quiet zones, and ensuring protection from self-generated RFI. The technical approaches include mitigation RFI in the analog and RF frontend systems, digital signal processing systems, and offline systems.As is known, the signal received by a radio telescope is a combination of the contributions from the astronomical signal and a combination of system and sky background noise. RFI has an additive effect on the signal received by the radio telescope. The key distinguishing properties of RFI are that it is generally stronger than the signal and non-Gaussian.The capability of signal processing receiver systems has grown manifold with the advent of high-speed signal processing platforms like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This has enabled the development of different signal-processing techniques for real-time RFI mitigation algorithms.

High Resolution {\it BOES} Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He~II$\lambda$6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae,"Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at $\sim$ 6545~Å. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from April 2019 to March 2020 using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph ({\it BOES}). Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered \ion{He}{2} at 6545~Å in NGC~6881 and NGC~6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC~6741 and NGC~6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the \ion{H}{1} component relative to the \ion{He}{2} emission region ranges from $26-33~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC~6881, NGC~6741, NGC~6886, and NGC~6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of \ion{H}{1} components with masses around $10^{-2}~M_\odot$, moving outward from the central \ion{He}{2} emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.","['Jin Lim', 'Seok-Jun Chang', 'Jaejin Shin', 'Hee-Won Lee', 'Jiyu Kim', 'Hak-Sub Kim', 'Bo-Eun Choi', 'Ho-Gyu Lee']",10.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03558,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['Interdisciplinary astronomy(804) 1'],2025-01-08
Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions,"Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.",['Mehdi Yousefzadeh'],6.0,8.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03559,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Plasma Physics', 'Space Physics']",,,['Solar corona (1483 )'],2025-01-08
Spectro-timing analysis of Be X-ray pulsar SMC X-2 during the 2022 outburst,"We present broadband X-ray observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) pulsar SMC X-2, using concurrent NuSTAR and NICER observations during its 2022 outburst. The source is found to be spinning with a period of 2.37281(3) s. We confirm the existence of cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at 31 keV in addition to the iron emission line in the X-ray continuum of the source. Spectral analysis performed with the physical bulk and thermal Comptonization model indicates that the bulk Comptonization dominates the thermal Comptonization. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we have investigated the variations of the spectral parameters relative to pulse phase that may be due to the complex structure of magnetic field of the pulsar or the impact of the emission geometry. It is observed that the spectral parameters exhibit significant variabilities relative to the pulsed phase. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to examine the evolution of the continuum and changes in the spectral characteristics. Measurements of luminosity along with variations in cyclotron line energy and photon index suggest that the source may be accreting in the super-critical regime.","['Mohammed Tobrej', 'Binay Rai', 'Manoj Ghising', 'Ruchi Tamang', 'Bikash Chandra Paul']",9.0,20.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03576,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['neutron-pulsars', 'accretion discs-stars', 'SMC X-2 *Corresponding author E-mail: bcpaul@associates', 'X-ray binaries']",2025-01-08
Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts,"The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.",['Xin-Ying Song'],2.0,9.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03610,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Compact objects(288)'],2025-01-08
The joint detection rate of short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers,"In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the power-law delay model marginally preferred over the Gaussian and lognormal delay models based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $1.73_{-0.45}^{+0.60}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}).

The impact of mass uncertainties on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers,"Theoretical predictions of element yields from the rapid neutron capture (r-) process are subject to large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of matter ejection. A major source of uncertainty in determining ejecta composition and radioactive decay heat is the lack of nuclear mass data for exotic neutron-rich nuclei produced during neutron irradiation.We examine both model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and their impact on r-process nucleosynthesis, and consequently, the composition of neutron star merger ejecta. To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear mass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a backward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from local variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known masses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find that uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance uncertainties of 20% up to A $\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with peaks around A $\simeq$ 140 and A $\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of 100-300%. While correlated model uncertainties generally exceed parameter uncertainties for most nuclei, both have a significant impact on heavy element production.Overall, improvements in nuclear models are essential to reducing uncertainties in r-process predictions. Both correlated model uncertainties and coherent determination of parameter uncertainties are crucial for sensitivity analysis in r-process nucleosynthesis.","['S. Martinet', 'S.

$\Lambda$CDM Model Against Gravity-Thermodynamics Conjecture: Observational Constraints After DESI 2024,"In the context of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture based on the Tsallis entropy-area relation, we investigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and examine some potential deviations from it. Utilizing recent updates from geometrical datasets, including the DESI BAO measurements (2024), Planck CMB anisotropy measurements (2018), and the Pantheon+ catalogue for SNIa (2022), we conduct a thorough analysis via the window of Tsallis cosmology. In the first step, our analysis reveals no significant deviation from the standard model when using DESI BAO data alone, Pantheon+ data alone, or a combination of both. In the next step, we incorporate all datasets by adding the CMB data to our analysis, indicating a potential deviation from the standard model within the framework of Tsallis cosmology.

The fine-scale structure of polar coronal holes,"Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.","['Richard J.

Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5 $\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.","['Muriel Zoë Stiefel', 'Matej Kuhar', 'Olivier Limousin', 'Ewan C.M.

A cosmic degeneracy story: structure formation with warm dark matter and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities,"It has been recently shown that cosmological models with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) could provide a possible path to solve current cosmic tensions. Moreover, it has been pointed out that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) for several observables at low redshift. Here, we confirm the qualitative similarity of the matter power spectrum for sPNG and WDM models, but also point out differences in the halo mass function and void size function. We then jointly simulate WDM and sPNG together. Such simulations allow us to demonstrate that the joint impact of WDM and sPNG is close to the linear superposition of their respective effects at low redshift, at the percent level. We finally propose a model with mixed hot and cold dark matter together with sPNG, that reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum at redshifts $z \leq 3$ but is still distinct in terms of halo statistics.","['Clément Stahl', 'Benoit Famaey', 'Rodrigo Ibata', 'Katarina Kraljic', 'Fabien Castillo']",7.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03672,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-08
Effects of energetic particles produced by magnetic reconnection on discs of young stars,"T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.",['Valentin Brunn'],18.0,320.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03678,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena']",,,"['acceleration of particles – accretion', 'accretion discs – magnetic reconnection – stars: ﬂare']",2025-01-08
Characterizing WASP-43b's interior structure: unveiling tidal decay and apsidal motion,"Context. Recent developments in exoplanetary research highlight the importance of Love numbers in understanding their internal dynamics, formation, migration history and their potential habitability. Love numbers represent crucial parameters that gauge how exoplanets respond to external forces such as tidal interactions and rotational effects. By measuring these responses, we can gain insights into the internal structure, composition, and density distribution of exoplanets. The rate of apsidal precession of a planetary orbit is directly linked to the second-order fluid Love number, thus we can gain valuable insights into the mass distribution of the planet. Aims. In this context, we aim to re-determine the orbital parameters of WASP-43b-in particular, orbital period, eccentricity, and argument of the periastron-and its orbital evolution. We study the outcomes of the tidal interaction with the host star:whether tidal decay and periastron precession are occurring in the system. Method. We observed the system with HARPS, whose data we present for the first time, and we also analyse the newly acquired JWST full-phase light curve. We fit jointly archival and new radial velocity and transit and occultation mid-times, including tidal decay, periastron precession and long-term acceleration in the system. Results. We detected a tidal decay rate of \dotP_a=(-1.99pm0.50) and a periastron precession rate of \dotomega=(0.1851+0.0070-0.0077)=(0.1727+0.0083-0.0089)deg/d=(621.72+29.88-32.04)arcsec/d. This is the first time that both periastron precession and tidal decay are simultaneously detected in an exoplanetary system. The observed tidal interactions can neither be explained by the tidal contribution to apsidal motion of a non-aligned stellar or planetary rotation axis nor by assuming non-synchronous rotation for the planet, and a value for the planetary Love number cannot be derived.

Continuation of an Optical Spectroscopic Campaign of Fermi Blazar Candidates with TNG: Discovery of a New Changing-Look Blazar,"Context. Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gamma-ray blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are an ongoing challenge in gamma-ray astronomy due to difficulties in classification and redshift determination. Aims. This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at identifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift estimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We conducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21 low-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the literature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL J2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of them, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite previously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look blazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum. Additionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to inconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any redshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into the classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing the need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.","['N. Álvarez Crespo', 'A.

Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars,"Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.","['J. Sanz-Forcada', 'M. López-Puertas', 'M. Lampón', 'S. Czesla', 'L. Nortmann', 'J. A. Caballero', 'M. R.

Constraints on the properties of macroscopic transport in the Sun from combined lithium and beryllium depletion,"Context. The Sun is a privileged laboratory of stellar evolution, thanks to the quality and complementary nature of available constraints. Using these observations, we are able to draw a detailed picture of its internal structure and dynamics which form the basis of the successes of solar modelling. Amongst such constraints, the depletion of lithium and beryllium are key tracers of the required efficiency and extent of macroscopic mixing just below the solar convective envelope. Thanks to revised determinations of these abundances, we may use them in conjunction with other existing spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints to study in detail the properties of macroscopic transport. Aims. We aim at constraining the efficiency of macroscopic transport at the base of the convective envelope and determining the compatibility of the observations with a suggested candidate linked with the transport of angular momentum in the solar radiative interior. Methods. We use recent spectroscopic observations of lithium and beryllium abundance and include them in solar evolutionary model calibrations. We test the agreement of such models in terms of position of the convective envelope, helium mass fraction in convective zone, sound speed profile inversions and neutrino fluxes. Results. We constrain the required efficiency and extent of the macroscopic mixing at the base of the solar convective envelope, finding that a power law of density with an index n between 3 and 6 would reproduce the data, with efficiencies at the base of the envelope of about 6000 cm2 /s, depending on the value of n. We also confirm that macroscopic mixing worsens the agreement with neutrino fluxes and that the current implementations of the magnetic Tayler instability are unable to explain the observations.","['G.

Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars,"NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a much higher abundance of Classical Be stars (CBe) than typical open clusters. We perform a membership analysis using GAIA DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be 3.6 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc. We identify 499 GAIA-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.5 M$\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.2 %. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using standard deviation, median absolute deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66 % of CBe stars are variable: 23 % show periodic signals from pulsation or rotation, 41 \% exhibit variability from disk dynamics or binarity, and 14 % have long-term variations due to disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50 \% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50 % are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.","['Arghya Chakraborty', 'Jessy Jose', 'Alex C.

Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology,"In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy has become a topic of interest in cosmology. Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to {\Lambda}CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.","['Guandi Zhao', 'Jiajun Zhang', 'Peng Wang', 'Ji Yao']",11.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03750,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-08
Conditions for radiative zones in the molecular hydrogen envelope of Jupiter and Saturn: The role of alkali metals,"Interior models of gas giants in the Solar System traditionally assume a fully convective molecular hydrogen envelope. However, recent observations from the Juno mission suggest a possible depletion of alkali metals in Jupiter's molecular hydrogen envelope, indicating that a stable radiative layer could exist at the kilobar level. Recent studies propose that deep stable layers help reconcile various Jupiter observations, including its atmospheric water and CO abundances and the depth of its zonal winds. However, opacity tables used to infer stable layers are often outdated and incomplete, leaving the precise molecular hydrogen envelope composition required for a deep radiative zone uncertain. In this paper, we determine atmospheric compositions that can lead to the formation of a radiative zone at the kilobar level in Jupiter and Saturn today. We computed radiative opacity tables covering pressures up to $10^5$ bar, including the most abundant molecules present in the gas giants of the Solar System, as well as contributions from free electrons, metal hydrides, oxides, and atomic species, using the most up-to-date line lists published in the literature. These tables were used to calculate Rosseland-mean opacities for the molecular hydrogen envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then compared to the critical mean opacity required to maintain convection. We find that the presence of a radiative zone is controlled by the existence of K, Na, and NaH in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. For Jupiter, the elemental abundance of K and Na must be less than $\sim 10^{-3}$ times solar to form a radiative zone. In contrast, for Saturn, the required abundance for K and Na is below $\sim 10^{-4}$ times solar.","['Louis Siebenaler', 'Yamila Miguel', 'Sam de Regt', 'Tristan Guillot']",10.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03756,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,A&A,,['Planets and satellites: gaseous planets – Planets and satellites: atmospheres 1'],2025-01-08
High-frequency coronal Alfv\'enic waves observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP,"The presence and nature of low-frequency (0.1-10~mHz) Alfvénic waves in the corona has been established over the last decade, with many of these results coming from coronagraphic observations of the infrared Fe XIII line. The Cryo-NIRSP instrument situated at DKIST has recently begun acquiring science quality data of the same Fe XIII line, with at least a factor of 9 improvement in spatial resolution, a factor 30 increase in temporal resolution and an increase in signal-to-noise, when compared to the majority of previously available data. Here we present an analysis of 1~s cadence sit-and-stare data from Cryo-NIRSP, examining the Doppler velocity fluctuations associated with the Fe XIII 1074~nm coronal line. We are able to confirm previous results of Alfvénic waves in the corona as well as explore a new frequency regime. The data reveals that the power law behaviour of the Doppler velocity power spectrum extends to higher frequencies. This result appears to challenge some models of photospheric-driven Alfvénic waves that predict a lack of high frequency wave power in the corona due to strong chromospheric damping. Moreover, the high-frequency waves do not transport as much energy as their low-frequency counterparts, with less time-averaged energy per frequency interval. We are also able to confirm the incompressible nature of the fluctuations with little coherence between the line amplitude and Doppler velocity time-series.","['Richard J.

Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density observed in dark matter halos,"It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.",['Jorge Sanchez Almeida'],11.0,19.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03761,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,"""Galaxies""",,['Dark matter'],2025-01-08
Eclipsing binary systems with $\beta$ Cephei components. V1216 Sco,"We present a detailed analysis of the high-mass binary system V1216 Sco, an eclipsing Algol-type binary hosting a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator, with an orbital period of 3.92 days. This system was analyzed using TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy from SALT HRS to investigate its orbital parameters, stellar properties, and evolutionary history. The TESS light curve, comprising over 12000 data points, revealed five independent pulsation frequencies within the beta Cephei range of 5 to 7 d$^{-1}$.Spectroscopic analysis provided radial velocities and disentangled atmospheric parameters, enabling precise orbital and evolutionary modeling. The system features a primary star of 11.72 M$_{\odot}$ and a secondary of 4.34 M$_{\odot}$. The secondary star has a radius near its Roche lobe, indicating recent or ongoing mass transfer. Evolutionary modeling with MESA-binary suggests that V1216 Sco underwent a case A mass transfer scenario, where mass transfer began while the donor was still on the main sequence. The system's evolutionary models indicate an age of 15 to 30 million years, highlighting the significant impact of binary interactions on stellar evolution.This study underscores the value of combining observational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex systems like V1216 Sco, emphasizing the role of mass transfer in shaping binary star evolution.","['A.

Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data,"Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z<0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s.

The occurrence of powerful flares stronger than X10 class in Solar Cycles,"Solar flares stronger than X10 (S-flares, >X10) are the highest class flares which significantly impact on the Sun's evolution and space weather. Based on observations of Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) at soft X-ray (SXR) wavelength and the daily sunspot numbers (DSNs) since 1975, we obtained some interesting and heuristic conclusions: (1) Both S-flares and the more powerful extremely strong flares (ES-flares, >X14.3) mostly occur in the late phases of solar cycles and low-latitude regions on the solar disk; (2) Similar to X-class flares, the occurrence of S-flares in each solar cycle is somewhat random, but the occurrence of ES-flares seems to be dominated by the mean DSN (Vm) and its root-mean-square deviation during the valley phase (Vd) before the cycle: the ES-flare number is strongly correlated with Vd, and the occurrence time of the first ES-flare is anti-correlated with Vd and Vm. These facts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the more the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred. We proposed that the Sun may have a low-latitude active zone (LAZ), and most ES-flares are generated from the interaction between LAZ and the newly emerging active regions. The correlations and the linear regression functions may provide an useful method to predict the occurrence of ES-flares in an upcoming solar cycle, which derives that solar cycle 25 will have about 2 ES-flares after the spring of 2027.","['Baolin Tan', 'Yin Zhang', 'Jing Huang', 'Kaifan Ji']",4.0,10.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03791,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['solar ﬂares — sunspot number — solar cycle 1'],2025-01-08
Mixing by Internal Gravity Waves in Stars: Assessing Numerical Simulations Against Theory,"Here we present a study of radial chemical mixing in non-rotating massive main-sequence stars driven by internal gravity waves (IGWs), based on multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the fully compressible code MUSIC. We examine two proposed mechanisms of material mixing in stars by IGWs that are commonly quoted, relating to thermal diffusion and sub-wavelength shearing. Thermal diffusion provides a non-restorative effect to the waves, leaving material displaced from its previous equilibrium, while shearing arising within the waves drives weak localised flows, mixing the fluid there. Using IGW spectra from the simulations, we evaluate theoretical predictions of mixing rates due to these mechanisms. We show, for $20M_\odot$ main-sequence stars, that neither of these mechanisms are likely to create mixing sufficient to correct inaccuracies in current stellar evolution models. Furthermore, we compare these predictions to results obtained from Lagrangian tracer particles, following a method recently used for global simulations of stellar interiors to measure mixing by IGWs in their radiative zones. We demonstrate that tracer particle methods face significant numerical challenges in measuring the small diffusion coefficients predicted by the aforementioned theories, for which they are prone to yielding artificially enhanced coefficients. Diffusion coefficients based on such methods are currently used with stellar evolution codes for asteroseismic studies, but should be viewed with caution. Finally, in a case where tracer particles do not suffer from numerical artefacts, we suggest that a diffusion model is not suitable for timescales typically considered by two-dimensional numerical simulations.","['Jack Morton', 'Thomas Guillet', 'Isabelle Baraffe', 'Adrien Morison', 'Arthur Le Saux', 'Dimitar Vlaykov', 'Tom Goffrey', 'Jane Pratt']",13.0,18.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03796,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['hydrodynamics – waves – stars: interiors – methods: numerical – asteroseismology – stars: evolution 1 INTRODUCTION Mixing through the stably stratified regions of stars is critical to their evolution'],2025-01-08
"TOI-5108 b and TOI 5786 b: Two transiting sub-Saturns detected and characterized with TESS, MaHPS and SOPHIE","We report the discovery and characterization of two sub-Saturns from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) using high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the MaHPS spectrograph at the Wendelstein Observatory and the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory. Combining photometry from TESS, KeplerCam, LCOGT, and MuSCAT2 with the radial velocity measurements from MaHPS and SOPHIE we measure precise radii and masses for both planets. TOI-5108 b is a sub-Saturn with a radius of $6.6 \pm 0.1$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $32 \pm 5$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-5786 b is similar to Saturn with a radius of $8.54 \pm 0.13$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $73 \pm 9$ $M_\oplus$. The host star for TOI-5108 b is a moderately bright (Vmag 9.75) G-type star. TOI-5786 is a slightly dimmer (Vmag 10.2) F-type star. Both planets are close to their host stars with periods of 6.75 days and 12.78 days respectively. This puts TOI-5108 b just inside the bounds of the Neptune desert while TOI-5786 b is right above the upper edge. We estimate hydrogen-helium envelope mass fractions of $38 \%$ for TOI-5108 b and $74 \% $ for TOI-5786 b. However, using a model for the interior structure that includes tidal effects the envelope fraction of TOI-5108 b could be much lower ($\sim 20\,\%$) depending on the obliquity. We estimate mass-loss rates between 1.0 * $10^9$ g/s and 9.8 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5108 b and between 3.6 * $10^8$ g/s and 3.5 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5786 b. Given their masses, this means that both planets are stable against photoevaporation. We also detect a transit signal for a second planet candidate in the TESS data of TOI-5786 with a period of 6.998 days and a radius of $3.83 \pm 0.16$ $R_\oplus$.

Dimming GRS 1915+105 observed with NICER and Insight--HXMT,"The black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 was bright for 26 years since its discovery and is well-known for its disk instabilities, quasi-periodic oscillations, and disk wind signatures. We report a long-term spectral-timing tracing of this source from mid-2017 until the onset of the ""obscured state"", based on the complete data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Insight--Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), whose hard coverage decisively informs the modeling at lower energies. In the soft state predating 2018, we observed highly ionized winds. However, in the hard state shortly before transitioning into the ""obscured state"" on May 14, 2019 (MJD 58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\log \xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the measurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the estimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of different spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We delve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard state. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay phase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism of those winds in both states is likely the same. The presence of the ionized winds is preferentially dependent on the periphery of the accretion disk, but not directly related to the corona activities in the center of the binary system.","['M.

High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam: New multi-band templates,"We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.","['K.

Demonstration of Ultra-Sensitive KIDs for Future THz Space Borne Polarimeters,"We present measurements and simulations of the polarization purity of leaky lens-antenna coupled microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) at 1.5 THz. We find the integrated cross-polarization level to be at -21.5 dB for 1 f\#$\lambda$ spatial sampling. The measurements agree well with the theoretical description which is based on a combination of in-transmission simulation of the antenna feed, and an in-reception analysis of the antenna-KID system.

Characterization of Markarian 421 during its most violent year: Multiwavelength variability and correlations,"Mrk 421 was in its most active state around early 2010, which led to the highest TeV gamma-ray flux ever recorded from any active galactic nuclei. We aim to characterize the multiwavelength behavior during this exceptional year for Mrk 421, and evaluate whether it is consistent with the picture derived with data from other less exceptional years. We investigated the period from November 5, 2009, (MJD 55140) until July 3, 2010, (MJD 55380) with extensive coverage from very-high-energy (VHE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$GeV) gamma rays to radio with MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, VLBA, and a variety of additional optical and radio telescopes. We investigated the variability and correlation behavior among different energy bands in great detail. We find the strongest variability in X-rays and VHE gamma rays, and PSDs compatible with power-law functions. We observe strong correlations between X-rays and VHE gamma rays. We also report a marginally significant positive correlation between high-energy (HE; E$\,>\,$100$\,$MeV) gamma rays and the ultraviolet band. We detected marginally significant correlations between the HE and VHE gamma rays, and between HE gamma rays and the X-ray, that disappear when the large flare in February 2010 is excluded from the correlation study. The activity of Mrk 421 also yielded the first ejection of features in the VLBA images of the jet of Mrk 421. Yet the large uncertainties in the ejection times of these radio features prevent us from firmly associating them to the specific flares recorded during the campaign. We also show that the collected multi-instrument data are consistent with a scenario where the emission is dominated by two regions, a compact and extended zone, which could be considered as a simplified implementation of an energy-stratified jet as suggested by recent IXPE observations.","['K.

"An absolute mass, precise age, and hints of planetary winds for WASP-121 A and b from a JWST NIRSpec phase curve","We have conducted a planetary radial velocity measurement of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b using JWST NIRSpec phase curve data. Our analysis reveals the Doppler shift of the planetary spectral lines across the full orbit, which shifts considerably across the detector ($\sim$ 10 pixels). Using cross-correlation techniques, we have determined an overall planetary velocity amplitude of $K_{\rm p}=215.7\pm1.1$ km/s, which is in good agreement with the expected value. We have also calculated the dynamical mass for both components of the system by treating it as an eclipsing double-line spectroscopic binary, with WASP-121A having a mass of M$_{\star}$=1.330 $\pm$ 0.019 M$_{\odot}$, while WASP-121b has a mass of M$_{\rm p}$= 1.170 $\pm$ 0.043 M$_{\rm Jup}$. These dynamical measurements are $\sim3\times$ more precise than previous estimates and do not rely on any stellar modeling assumptions which have a $\sim$5\% systematic floor mass uncertainty. Additionally, we used stellar evolution modeling constrained with a stellar density and parallax measurement to determine a precise age for the system, found to be 1.11 $\pm$ 0.14 Gyr. Finally, we observed potential velocity differences between the two NIRSpec detectors, with NRS1 lower by 5.5$\pm$2.2 km/s. We suggest that differences can arise from day/night asymmetries in the thermal emission, which can lead to a sensitivity bias favoring the illuminated side of the planet, with planetary rotation and winds both acting to lower a measured $K_{\rm P}$. The planet's rotation can account for 1 km/s of the observed velocity difference, with 4.5$\pm$2.2 km/s potentially attributable to vertical differences in wind speeds.","['David K. Sing', 'Thomas M.

"Computational Astrophysics, Data Science & AI/ML in Astronomy: A Perspective from Indian Community","In contemporary astronomy and astrophysics (A&A), the integration of high-performance computing (HPC), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) has become essential for advancing research across a wide range of scientific domains. These tools are playing an increasingly pivotal role in accelerating discoveries, simulating complex astrophysical phenomena, and analyzing vast amounts of observational data. For India to maintain and enhance its competitive edge in the global landscape of computational astrophysics and data science, it is crucial for the Indian A&A community to fully embrace these transformative technologies. Despite limited resources, the expanding Indian community has already made significant scientific contributions. However, to remain globally competitive in the coming years, it is vital to establish a robust national framework that provides researchers with reliable access to state-of-the-art computational resources. This system should involve the regular solicitation of computational proposals, which can be assessed by domain experts and HPC specialists, ensuring that high-impact research receives the necessary support. By building such a system, India can cultivate the talent, infrastructure, and collaborative environment necessary to foster world-class research in computational astrophysics and data science.","['Prateek Sharma', 'Bhargav Vaidya', 'Yogesh Wadadekar', 'Jasjeet Bagla', 'Piyali Chatterjee', 'Shravan Hanasoge', 'Prayush Kumar', 'Dipanjan Mukherjee', 'Ninan Sajeeth Philip', 'Nishant Singh']",14.0,21.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03876,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,The Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy,,['High Performance Computing — AI /ML in Astronomy — Indian Astronomy 1'],2025-01-08
Cosmic-ray acceleration and escape from supernova remnant W44 as probed by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,"Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W44 and its surroundings are a prime target for studying the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Several previous studies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the radio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped high-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex. Aims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the spatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the results of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the northwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to explain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We first performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at energies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while we set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a likelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial information obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive constraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the particle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data suggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We propose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect and explain the gamma-ray emission.","['S. Abe', 'J. Abhir', 'A. Abhishek', 'V.A. Acciari', 'A. Aguasca-Cabot', 'I.

Polarization aberrations in next-generation Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs). II. Influence of segment-to-segment coating variations on high-contrast imaging and polarimetry,"Direct exo-Earth imaging is a key science goal for astronomy in the next decade. This ambitious task imposes a target contrast of ~10^-7 at wavelengths from I to J-band. In our prior study, we determined that polarization aberrations can limit the achievable contrast to 10^-5 to 10^-6 in the infrared. However, these results assumed a perfect coronagraph coupled to a telescope with an ideal coating on each of the mirrors. In this study we seek to understand the influence of polarization aberrations from segment-to-segment coating variations on coronagraphy and polarimetry. We use the Poke open-source polarization ray tracing package to compute the Jones pupil of each GSMT with spatially-varying coatings applied to the segments. The influence of the resultant polarization aberrations is simulated by propagating the Jones pupil through physical optics models of coronagraphs using HCIPy. After applying wavefront control from an ideal adaptive optics system, we determine that the segment-to-segment variations applied limit the performance of coronagraphy to a raw contrast of approximately 10^-8 in I-band, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower the target performance for high-contrast imaging systems on the ground. This is a negligible addition to the nominal polarization aberrations for ground-based systems. We further observe negligible degradation in polarimetric imaging of debris disks from segment-to-segment aberrations above and beyond the impact of nominal polarization aberration.","['Jaren N.

ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk,"The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28"" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and faster acceleration going toward the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at 55, 67 and 86 au from the star, coincident with regions of enhanced gas density in the disk. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted in rings of enhanced gas density could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.","['F.

Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference,"We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.","['Nicolas Mediato-Diaz', 'Will Handley']",7.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03921,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability', 'Machine Learning']",,,"['CMB power spectrum I', 'cosmology', 'simulation-based inference', 'Bayesian data analysis']",2025-01-08
Eruptive YSOs in Cygnus-X: a mid-infrared variability study with NEOWISE and SPICY,"The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.","['C. Morris', 'Z. Guo', 'P. W. Lucas', 'N. Miller', 'C. Contreras Peña', 'M. A.

Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal,"Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.","['Ariel Scolnic', 'Ealeal Bear', 'Noam Soker']",4.0,8.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03947,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Stars: jets'],2025-01-08
A novel experimental approach to uncover the nature of cosmic-ray Deuterium,"Studying the isotopic composition of cosmic-rays (CRs) provides crucial insights into the galactic environment and helps improve existing propagation models. Special attention is given to the secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components in CRs, as these measurements can offer complementary data compared to traditional secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Recently, a precision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV rigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess of D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new measurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether there is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin. While there are theoretical models that attempt to explain this excess, the experimental uncertainties on D production cross-sections and on CR propagation models remain significant, and only new and precise measurements can dissipate existing doubts. In this work we review the current experimental scenario and we propose a dedicated experiment able to extend the D abundance measurement up to 100 GeV/nucl without the need of a magnetic spectrometer, using a multiple scattering based technique for the measurement of particle momentum. The expected performances of the proposed detector were assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, and its role in the current particle physics scenario is discussed.","['Francesco Dimiccoli', 'Francesco Maria Follega']",10.0,16.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03966,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-08
Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: II. AGN feedback,"We investigate AGN feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, our simulations focus on comparing stellar-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited non-negligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.","['R.

Tracing the Winds: A Uniform Interpretation of Helium Escape in Exoplanets from Archival Spectroscopic Observations,"Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density ($F_{\text{XUV}}/\rho_p$), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to $0.34 \pm 0.13$ and $0.75 \pm 0.21$ for hydrogen-helium fractions of $0.90$ and $0.99$, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.","['Patrick McCreery', 'Leonardo A.

Many-body atomic response functions of xenon and germanium for leading-order sub-GeV dark matter-electron interactions in effective field theory,"Direct searches of dark matter candidates with mass energies less than 1 GeV is an active research field. The energy depositions are comparable to the scale of atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems, therefore many-body physics plays an important role in understanding the detector's response in dark matter scattering. We present in this work a comprehensive data set of atomic response functions for xenon and germanium with 12.2 and 80 eV energy thresholds, respectively, using the (multiconfiguration) relativistic random phase approximation. This approach takes into account the relativistic, exchange, and correlation effects in one self-consistent framework, and is benchmarked successfully by photoabsorption data from thresholds to 30 keV with $\lesssim5\%$ errors. Comparisons with our previous and some other independent particle approaches in literature are made. It is also found that the spin-dependent (SD) response has significant difference from the spin-independent (SI) one such that the dark matter SD and SI interactions with electrons can be distinguished in unpolarized scattering, which is typical for direct search detectors. Finally, the exclusion limits set by current experiments are updated with our new results.","['C.-P. Liu', 'Mukesh K.

A trailing lognormal approximation of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations at $2.2\leq z\leq 2.7$,"Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasar spectra with upcoming surveys are expected to provide significantly larger and higher-quality datasets. To interpret these datasets, it is imperative to develop efficient simulations. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. We know from our previous work that while scaling the linear density contrast by parameter $\nu$ can recover the thermal parameters within $\sim 1-\sigma$ of best-fit values, the recovery of $\Gamma_{12}$ remains discrepant at $\gtrsim 3-\sigma$ for $z > 2.2$. Keeping this in mind, we extend our earlier work to improve the lognormal model of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, particularly the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), between $2.2 \leq z \leq 2.7$, by simulating the model spectra at a slightly lower redshift than the Sherwood smooth particle hydrodynamical simulations (SPH) data. The recovery of thermal parameters, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$) and the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$) is also alleviated. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities tend to over-predict the number of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers seen in SPH simulation. A lognormal model simulated at a lower redshift than SPH data can address this limitation to a certain extent. We show that with such a ""trailing"" model of lognormal distribution, values of $\Gamma_{12}$ are recovered at $\lesssim 1-\sigma$. We argue that this model can be useful for constraining cosmological parameters.",['Bhaskar Arya'],6.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04055,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['intergalactic media', 'power spectrumarXiv:2501', 'Lyman- αforest']",2025-01-09
Milky Way dynamics in light of Gaia,"The Gaia mission has triggered major developments in the field of Galactic dynamics in recent years, which we discuss in this review. The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components - disc, bar/bulge and halo - are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.","['Jason A.

zELDA II: reconstruction of galactic Lyman-alpha spectra attenuated by the intergalactic medium using neural networks,"The observed Lyman-Alpha (Lya) line profile is a convolution of the complex Lya radiative transfer taking place in the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, and IGM, respectively). Discerning the different components of the Lya line is crucial in order to use it as a probe of galaxy formation or the evolution of the IGM. We present the second version of zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters), an open-source Python module focused on modeling and fitting observed Lya line profiles. This new version of zELDA focuses on disentangling the galactic from the IGM effects. We build realistic Lya line profiles that include the ISM and IGM contributions, by combining the Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations for the so called ""shell model"" (ISM) and IGM transmission curves generated from IllustrisTNG100. We use these mock line profiles to train different artificial neural networks. These use as input the observed spectrum and output the outflow parameters of the best fitting ""shell model"" along with the redshift and Lya emission IGM escape fraction of the source. We measure the accuracy of zELDA on mock Lya line profiles. We find that zELDA is capable of reconstructing the ISM emerging Lya line profile with high accuracy (Kolmogorov-Smirnov<0.1) for 95% of the cases for HST COS-like observations and 80% for MUSE-WIDE-like. zELDA is able to measure the IGM transmission with the typical uncertainties below 10% for HST-COS and MUSE-WIDE data. This work represents a step forward in the high-precision reconstruction of IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. zELDA allows the disentanglement of the galactic and IGM contribution shaping the Lya line shape, and thus allows us to use Lya as a tool to study galaxy and ISM evolution.","['Siddhartha Gurung-Lopez', 'Chris Byrohl', 'Max Gronke', 'Daniele Spinoso', 'Alberto Torralba', 'Alberto Fernandez-Soto', 'Pablo Arnalte-Mur', 'Vicent J.

Structural Parameters of the Thin Disk Population from Evolved Stars in Solar Neighborhood,"This study investigates the structural parameters of the thin-disk population by analyzing the spatial distribution of evolved stars in the solar neighbourhood. From the $\it Gaia$ Data Release 3 database, about 39.1 million stars within 1 kpc and with relative parallax errors $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.10$ were selected. The photometric data was corrected for extinction using a Galactic dust map. The sample was refined by considering the color-magnitude region $M_{\rm G}\times (G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ associated with evolved stars, applying a stricter parallax error limit of $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.02$, and yielding 671,600 stars. The star sample was divided into 36 regions based on their Galactic coordinates, with evolved stars in the absolute magnitude range of $-1< M_{\rm G}~{\rm (mag)}\leq 4$ further split into five one-unit magnitude intervals. This led to 180 subgroups whose space density profiles were modelled using a single-component Galaxy model. The analysis shows that the space densities are in agreement with the literature and that the scale heights vary with $200<H~{\rm (pc)}<600$ interval to their absolute magnitudes. Red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood were also estimated to have a scale height of $295\pm10$ pc. These findings indicate that evolved stars with bright absolute magnitudes originate from the evolution of the early spectral-type stars with short scale height, while fainter ones come from the evolution of the intermediate spectral-type stars with large scale height, suggesting variations in scale height reflect the contribution of Galactic evolution processes.","['S.

Toward early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: IV. Physical properties of three detached O/B-type systems in the LMC,"We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O-C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple and, tentatively, a quadruple. A significant non-linear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M$_\odot$ to 22.1 M$_\odot$, radii from 7.0 R$_\odot$ to 14.2 R$_\odot$, and temperatures between 22500 K and 36000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M$_\odot$ to 23 M$_\odot$. A new mass-luminosity relation for O and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.","['Mónica Taormina', 'G. Pietrzyński', 'R.-P.

Galaxy cluster characterization with machine learning techniques,"We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the galaxy cluster population in the z=0 snapshot of the IllustrisTNG simulations, utilizing machine learning techniques to perform clustering and regression tasks. We examine five properties of the hot gas (the central cooling time, the central electron density, the central entropy excess, the concentration parameter, and the cuspiness) which are commonly used as classification metrics to identify cool core (CC), weak cool core (WCC) and non cool core (NCC) clusters of galaxies. Using mock Chandra X-ray images as inputs, we first explore an unsupervised clustering scheme to see how the resulting groups correlate with the CC/WCC/NCC classification based on the different criteria. We observe that the groups replicate almost exactly the separation of the galaxy cluster images when classifying them based on the concentration parameter. We then move on to a regression task, utilizing a ResNet model to predict the value of all five properties. The network is able to achieve a mean percentage error of 1.8% for the central cooling time, and a balanced accuracy of 0.83 on the concentration parameter, making them the best-performing metrics. Finally, we use simulation-based inference (SBI) to extract posterior distributions for the network predictions. Our neural network simultaneously predicts all five classification metrics using only mock Chandra X-ray images.This study demonstrates that machine learning is a viable approach for analyzing and classifying the large galaxy cluster datasets that will soon become available through current and upcoming X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA.","['Maria Sadikov', 'Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo', 'Laurence Perreault Levasseur', 'Carter Lee Rhea', 'Michael McDonald', 'Michelle Ntampaka', 'John ZuHone']",20.0,23.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04081,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,ApJ,,"['machine learning', 'simulations 1', 'X-rays', 'galaxy clusters']",2025-01-09
Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries,"Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, final rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and ""other"" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb \approx Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb \approx 7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.","['Marshall Hobson-Ritz', 'Jessica Birky', 'Leah Peterson', 'Peter Gwartney', 'Rachel Wong', 'John Delker', 'Tyler Gordon', 'Samantha Gilbert', 'James R.

Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys,"When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.","['Hao-Zhu Fu', 'Subo Dong']",9.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04083,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['planets and satellites: general — planets and satellites: detection — gravita- tional lensing: micro 1 INTRODUCTION A planet gravitationally unbound to any host stars can be detected in a short-duration ( <1d) microlens- ing event'],2025-01-09
Effects of galactic environment on size and dark matter content in low-mass galaxies,"We utilize the cosmological volume simulation, FIREbox, to investigate how a galaxy's environment influences its size and dark matter content. Our study focuses on approximately 1,200 galaxies (886 central and 332 satellite halos) in the low-mass regime, with stellar masses between $10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We analyze the size-mass relation ($r_{50} - M_{\star}$), inner dark matter mass-stellar mass ($M^{50}_{\rm DM} - M_{\star}$) relation, and the halo mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm halo} - M_{\star}$) relation. At fixed stellar mass, we find the galaxies experiencing stronger tidal influences, indicated by higher Perturbation Indices (PI $>$ 1) are generally larger and have lower masses relative to their counterparts with lower Perturbation Indices (PI $<$ 1). Applying a Random Forest regression model, we show that both the environment (PI) and halo mass ($M_{rm halo}$) are significant predictors of a galaxy's relative size and dark matter content. Notably, because $M_{\rm halo}$ is also strongly affected by the environment, our findings indicate that environmental conditions not only influence galactic sizes and relative inner dark matter content directly, but also indirectly through their impact on halo mass. Our results highlight a critical interplay between environmental factors and halo mass in shaping galaxy properties, affirming the environment as a fundamental driver in galaxy formation and evolution.","['Francisco J.

CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers ``First Light"" and ``Galaxy Assembly,"" including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z >~ 10 from ~90 arcmin^2 of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of >1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6<z<10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z>3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility.

Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp,"We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV>0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a ""bump"" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.","['Subhash Bose', 'Maximilian D.

Accretion disc winds imprint distinct signatures in the optical variability spectrum of black hole transients,"Quantifying the variability, measured as the root mean square (rms), of accreting systems as a function of energy is a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of these objects. Here, we present the first application of this method to optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries. We use high-time-resolution data of the black hole transient V404 Cygni, obtained with the \textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} during its 2015 outburst. During this event, conspicuous wind-related features, such as P-Cygni profiles, were detected in the flux spectra. We find that rms spectra are rich in spectral features, although they are typically morphologically different from their flux counterparts. Specifically, we typically observe absorption components in correspondence to the presence of emission lines in the flux spectra. Similarly, when analysing segments with significant variability in the optical flux, P-Cygni line profiles appear inverted in the rms spectra (i.e., enhanced variability in the blue-shifted region, accompanied by a decrease in that associated with the red component). We discuss the possible origin of these features, which resemble those found in other objects, such as active galactic nuclei. Finally, we highlight the potential of this technique for future searches for wind-type outflows in accreting compact objects.","['F. M. Vincentelli', 'T.

Signs of `Everything Everywhere All At Once' formation in low surface brightness globular cluster-rich dwarf galaxies,"Only two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have spatially resolved stellar population properties, both showing radially flat-to-rising metallicity profiles, indicative of a different formation pathway to most dwarf galaxies. The scarcity of other low surface brightness (LSB) dwarfs with a similar analysis prevents a deeper understanding on this behaviour. We investigate the radial profiles of the ages, metallicities and star formation histories of four globular cluster (GC) rich LSB dwarfs, newly observed within the 'Analysis of Galaxies At The Extremes' (AGATE) collaboration. DFX1 and DF07 are bona-fide UDGs, while PUDG-R27 and VCC1448 are nearly UDGs (NUDGes). Comparing their and DF44's results to simulations, we aim to reveal their formation pathways. We use pPXF to fit different spectra extracted in annular apertures to recover the stellar population properties and compute their gradients. We compare those with a sample of literature classical dwarfs and simulations, in particular with simulated UDGs. Our five LSB dwarfs present flat age and flat-to-rising metallicity profiles. The flat age gradients are compatible with those of classical dwarfs (both observed and from cosmological simulations), but the metallicity gradient diverges. All of our LSB dwarfs (except for PUDG-R27, showing a pronounced increasing metallicity profile) are compatible with being the extreme tail of the age-metallicity gradient relation, with a preference to co-eval formation forming the galaxy all at once. This sample of GC-rich LSB dwarfs with spatially resolved properties confirms that they seem to follow a different formation path than classical dwarfs. However, larger samples with higher S/N spectra and varying amounts of GC richness are required to set robust constraints on the formation pathways of LSB dwarf galaxies.","['Anna Ferré-Mateu', 'Jonah Gannon', 'Duncan A.

"Streams, Shells, and Substructures in the Accretion-Built Stellar Halo of NGC 300","We present deep optical observations of the stellar halo of NGC 300, an LMC-mass galaxy, acquired with the DEEP sub-component of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) using the 4 m Blanco Telescope. Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream ($M_{V}\sim-8.5$; [Fe/H] $= -1.4\pm0.15$) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately $1:15$. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster ($R_{\rm{proj}}=23.3$~kpc; $M_{V}=-8.99\pm0.16$; [Fe/H] $\approx-1.6\pm0.6$) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified globular cluster associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.","['Catherine E.

Dissipation and particle acceleration in astrophysical jets with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink Instabilities,"We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.","['Tsun Hin Navin Tsung', 'Gregory R.

The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: Deep Fields Data Release 2. I. The ELAIS-N1 field,"We present the final 6'' resolution data release of the ELAIS-N1 field from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields project (LoTSS Deep). The 144MHz images are the most sensitive achieved to date at this frequency and were created from 290 TB of data obtained from 505 hrs on-source observations taken over 7.5 years. The data were processed following the strategies developed for previous LoTSS and LoTSS Deep data releases. The resulting images span 24.53 square degrees and, using a refined source detection approach, we identified 154,952 radio sources formed from 182,184 Gaussian components within this area. The maps reach a noise level of 10.7 $\mu$Jy/beam at 6'' resolution where approximately half of the noise is due to source confusion. In about 7.4% of the image our limited dynamic range around bright sources results in a further > 5% increase in the noise. The images have a flux density scale accuracy of about 9% and the standard deviation of offsets between our source positions and those from Pan-STARRS is 0.2'' in RA and Dec for high significance detections. We searched individual epoch images for variable sources, identifying 39 objects with considerable variation. We also searched for circularly polarised sources achieving three detections of previously known emitters (two stars and one pulsar) whilst constraining the typical polarisation fraction plus leakage to be less than 0.045%.","['T.

The angular momentum spiral of the Milky Way disc in Gaia,"Data from the Gaia mission shows prominent phase-space spirals that are the signatures of disequilibrium in the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the phase-space spiral in angular momentum (AM) space. Using Gaia DR3, we detect a prominent AM spiral in the solar neighbourhood. We demonstrate the relation of AM to the $z-v_z$ spiral and show that we can map to this space from angular momentum through simplifying assumptions. By modelling the orbit of stars in AM, we develop a generative model for the spiral where the disc is perturbed by a bulk tilt at an earlier time. Our model successfully describes the salient features of the AM spiral in the data. Modelling the phase spiral in AM is a promising method to constrain both perturbation and MW potential parameters. Our AM framework simplifies the interpretation of the spiral and offers a robust approach to modelling disequilibrium in the MW disc using all six dimensions of phase space simultaneously.","['Rashid Yaaqib', 'Aneesh P.

Non-stop Variability of Sgr A* using JWST at 2.1 and 4.8 micron Wavelengths: Evidence for Distinct Populations of Faint and Bright Variable Emission,"We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.","['F.

Revisiting the Classics: On the Statistics of Dust Formation in Novae,"While nova eruptions produce some of the most common and dramatic dust formation episodes among astrophysical transients, the demographics of dust-forming novae remain poorly understood. Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 < 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak. The significant fraction of novae that form dust make them ideal laboratories in our Galactic backyard to tackle the puzzle of dust formation around explosive transients.","['Atticus Chong', 'Elias Aydi', 'Peter Craig', 'Laura Chomiuk', 'Ashley Stone', 'Jay Strader', 'Adam Kawash', 'Kirill V.

VLTI/GRAVITY enables the determination of the first dynamical masses of a classical Be + stripped and bloated pre-subdwarf binary,"HR~6819 is the first post-mass transfer binary system composed of a classical Be star and a bloated pre-subdwarf stripped star directly confirmed by interferometry. While the Be star is already spun up to near-critical rotation and possesses a self-ejected viscous Keplerian disk, the stripped star is found in a short-lived evolutionary stage, in which it retains the spectral appearance of a B-type main-sequence star while contracting into a faint subdwarf OB-type star. In order to understand the evolution of intermediate-mass interacting binaries, the fundamental parameters of cornerstone objects such as HR~6819 need to be known. We aim to obtain orbital parameters and model-independent dynamical masses of this binary system to quantitatively characterize this rarely observed evolutionary stage. We analyzed a time series of 12 interferometric near-IR $K$-band observations from VLTI/GRAVITY with the help of the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. We included recently published radial velocities based on FEROS high-resolution spectroscopy for the binary orbital solution. With the GRAVITY data, we obtained the astrometric orbit, relative fluxes of the components, and parameters of the circumstellar disk of the Be star; we also detected helium line signatures from the stripped star. Using the published radial velocities enabled us to obtain the dynamical masses of the components as well as the dynamical parallax. The Be star is the slightly brighter component in the $K$ band and is almost 16 times as massive as the bloated stripped star, with the individual dynamical masses being $4.24\pm0.31 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the Be star and $0.270\pm0.056 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the stripped star. The orbit is slightly eccentric, with $e=0.0289\pm0.0058$, and the semimajor axis of the orbit is $0.3800\pm0.0093$ AU. (Abstract continues but does not fit here)","['R. Klement', 'Th. Rivinius', 'D.

\texttt{Pz Cats}: Photometric redshift catalogs based on DES Y3 BAO sample,"The photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has been developed over the years with various methods. In this work, we analyse four different photo-z estimators using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample: \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF}. Unlike what is usually found in the literature, we investigate the possibility of selecting the best galaxies according to their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF). We selected 25,760 galaxies from four different spectroscopic surveys and cross-matched them with the photo-z sample. These galaxies served to understand the redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. We found that within a range of $0.79<z_p<0.85$ there is the lowest $\sigma$ for all the estimators we analysed. \texttt{DNF} has the biggest absolute value of the bias ($\sigma$), while \texttt{ENF}, \texttt{ANNz2} and \texttt{BPZ} lose precision for a redshift range below 0.7 and higher than 0.9. If one wants to pick the best galaxies by removing the bins with the worst bias, one will find that \texttt{ANNz2} is the most robust algorithm for all chosen criteria. When selecting the best PDFs, the resulting sub-samples gave \texttt{BPZ} with more selected objects. \texttt{ANNz2} shows better precision, \texttt{ENF} has the worst selection of Gaussian PDFs, with very few galaxies left for an LSS study. We also showed that even though the PDFs are smooth, there are catastrophic redshift results. Lastly, \texttt{DNF} is the worst in precision but with sufficient galaxies for cosmological analysis. We also selected galaxies whose PDFs have only secondary peaks not bigger than 30\% of the main peak height, called Small Peaks. For these sub-samples, \texttt{ANNz2} outperformed the other algorithms. We will make all catalogs publicly available through the package \texttt{Pz Cats}.","['Paula S. Ferreira', 'Ribamar R. R.

The Effects of Magneto-Convection on Short Period Cataclysmic Variables,"Many of the current problems related to the evolution of cataclysmic variables revolve around the magnetic nature of the main sequence secondary. It is known that magnetic fields alter the structure of low mass stars. In particular, they inhibit convection, leading to inflated radii. Here we present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of magneto-convection on the evolution of short period cataclysmic variables. We find that the inclusion of magneto-convection leads to larger secondaries, longer orbital periods and smaller mass-loss rates. When including magnetic effects, the minimum orbital period is increased by 14 minutes, indicating that this could help alleviate the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variable evolution. We also examine the effect of the white dwarf mass on the minimum period. While increasing the white dwarf mass does increase the minimum period, it is not substantial. Therefore it is unlikely that the period minimum problem can be solved with a larger white dwarf mass or with mass growth of white dwarf.","['Conor M.

Detecting rotation from lensing in the CMB,"An excellent estimate of the lensing signal is expected from the availability of deep and high-resolution polarization data in the near future. This is most important to allow for efficient delensing, needed to detect the primordial B-mode power and with it the famous tensor-to-scalar ratio. Here we discuss in a joint manner estimators of the rotation of polarization, of the second order lensing field rotation, and standard gradient lensing reconstruction. All are most efficient when able to probe the EB power created locally, have comparable reconstruction noise in this regime, and can benefit substantially from delensing. We discuss several ongoing and planned CMB experiments. We determine their noise for lensing field rotation and polarization rotation and discuss their prospects for measuring these effects. There is an on-going controversy on whether the lensing field rotation also rotates the polarization -- if so this will be observed at high significance soon with already on going observations of the South Pole Telescope, SPT-3G, in cross-correlation with tracers of large scale structure, as we show in this paper.","['Julien Carron', 'Enea di Dio', 'Ruth Durrer']",8.0,20.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04158,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-09
Revisiting The Cosmological Time Dilation of Distant Quasars: Influence of Source Properties and Evolution,"After decades of searching, cosmological time dilation was recently identified in the timescale of variability seen in distant quasars. Here, we expand on the previous analysis to disentangle this cosmological signal from the influence of the properties of the source population, specifically the quasar bolometric luminosity and the rest-frame emission wavelength at which the variability was observed. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence of the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time. We find that a significant intrinsic scatter of 0.288 +- 0.021 dex in the variability timescales, which was not considered in the previous analysis, is favoured by the data. This slightly increases the uncertainty in the results. However, the expected cosmological dependence of the variability timescales is confirmed to be robust to changes in the underlying assumptions. We find that the variability timescales increase smoothly with both wavelength and bolometric luminosity, and that black hole mass has no effect on the variability timescale once rest wavelength and bolometric luminosity are accounted for. Moreover, if the standard cosmological model is correct, governed by relativistic expansion, we also find very little cosmological evolution in the intrinsic variability timescales of distant quasars.","['Brendon J.

eRO-ExTra: eROSITA extragalactic non-AGN X-ray transients and variables in eRASS1 and eRASS2,"(Abridged) While previous X-ray studies showed the dominance of regular active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability, a small fraction of sources arise from more exotic phenomena such as tidal disruption events (TDEs), quasi-periodic eruptions, or other short-lived events associated with supermassive black hole accretion. This paper describes the systematic selection of X-ray extragalactic transients found in the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS) that are not associated with known AGN prior to eROSITA observations. We generated a variability sample from eRASS1 and eRASS2 (Dec. 2019-Dec. 2020), which includes sources with a variability significance and a fractional amplitude larger than four, located in the Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) footprint. The properties of LS10 counterparts were used to exclude stars and known AGN. The sample was additionally cleaned using pre-eROSITA classifications, archival optical spectra, and archival X-ray data. The final catalog eRO-ExTra includes 304 extragalactic eROSITA transients and variables not associated with known AGN. More than 90% of sources have reliable LS10 optical counterparts. For each source, we provide archival X-ray data from Swift, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton; the eROSITA long-term light curve (2-2.5 years) with a light curve classification; as well as the best power law fit spectral results at the peak eROSITA epoch. Reliable spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are provided for more than 80% of the sample. Several sources in the catalog are known TDE candidates discovered by eROSITA. In addition, 31 sources are radio detected. The eRO-ExTra transients constitute a relatively clean parent sample of non-AGN variability phenomena associated with massive black holes. More than 95% of eRO-ExTra sources were discovered in X-rays with eROSITA for the first time, which makes it a valuable resource for studying unique nuclear transients.","['Iuliia Grotova', 'Arne Rau', 'Mara Salvato', 'Johannes Buchner', 'Adelle J.

TransientVerse: A Comprehensive Real-Time Alert and Multi-Wavelength Analysis System for Transient Astronomical Events,"Transient astrophysical events are characterized by short timescales, high energy, and multi-wavelength radiation, often accompanied by violent energy releases. These phenomena are a major focus of modern astronomical research. To reveal their underlying physical mechanisms, near-real-time, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger follow-up observations are essential. However, current transient alert systems face multiple challenges, including fragmented messages, inconsistent formats, and difficulties in retrospective analysis, all of which hinder the efficiency of triggering observations. This paper presents \textbf{TransientVerse}, an innovative real-time database platform to integrate and disseminate transient alerts. The platform uses an automated pipeline to integrate real-time alerts from multiple sources (e.g., ATel, VOEvent, and GCN). It structures unstructured text data into a dual-format database for transient alerts by using open-source large language models. TransientVerse offers retrospective searches, data visualization, literature reviews, and customized subscriptions for efficient event tracking and analysis. Additionally, for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), the platform provides real-time statistics on repeat burst rates across different time intervals and alerts astronomers about high-frequency burst sources, enabling rapid follow-up observations and optimizing the use of limited observation windows. TransientVerse improves the efficiency of acquiring transient events in real time, lowers the technical barriers for simultaneous observations, and provides robust technical support for multi-wavelength, multi-messenger time-domain astronomy and astrophysics studies.","['Jian-Hua Fang', 'Di Li', 'Pei Wang', 'Hua-Xi Chen', 'Han Wang', 'Deng-Ke Zhou', 'Qin-Ping Bao', 'Hai-Yan Li', 'Jing-Jing Hu', 'Jin-Tao Xie', 'Xiao-Dong Ge', 'Yi Feng', 'Dong-Hui Quan', 'Zhi-Xuan Kang', 'Xue-Rong Guo', 'Chen-Wu Jin', 'Zhi-Lin Wang', 'Jia-Ying Xu', 'Chen-Chen Miao', 'Ru-Shuang Zhao', 'Chen-Hui Niu']",8.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04247,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,"['summarizing the key metadata of astronomical events', 'Dec', 'Transient sources', 'and Source Type are extracted from the textual messages using LLMs', 'These criteria allow astronomers to filter mes- sages and locate relevant transient source alerts', 'extracted from the alert reports', 'Source Name', 'such as RA', 'Dechms', 'The results are then sorted by relevance and citation count', 'Report Subjects', 'The bottom section displays recent alerts and a skymap showing the spatial distribution of transient sources', 'RAhms', 'Locerr', 'Tele- scope', 'showing only the top 20 papers']",2025-01-09
Constrain the GRB jet opening angle based on the very steep decay phase,"Thanks to the rapid follow-up observations by \textit{Swift}/XRT, a good part of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) high latitude emission have been observed in X-ray band. Some of them even show a dropdown decay after this period, which strongly indicates the edge of the jet is corresponding to the breaking time. This study constrains the jet opening angles of GRBs by analyzing the very steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Using data from \textit{Swift}/XRT, we identified GRBs with significant breaks in their light curves and applied a broken power-law model to describe the decay phases. Assuming a spherical and isotropic emitting surface, we set constraints on the radiation radius ($R_{\gamma}$) to estimate jet opening angles ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) from the breaking time. Our results indicate that jet opening angles can be constrained, although they are sensitive to the assumed radiation radius. This approach provides yet another method for estimating GRB jet opening angles.","['Qian Xu', 'Dong-Jie Liu', 'Yuan-Chuan Zou']",1.0,7.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04252,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['gamma-ray burst: general – stars: jets – relativistic processes 1'],2025-01-09
Research on the Interstellar Medium and Star Formation in the Galaxy: An Indian Perspective,"Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved.

LAMOST Reveals Long-lived Protoplanetary Disks,"While both observations and theories demonstrate that protoplanetary disks are not expected to live much longer than $\sim$10 Myr, several examples of prolonged disks have been observed in the past. In this work, we perform a systematic search for aged YSOs still surrounded by protoplanetary disks in the M star catalog from the LAMOST archive. We identify 14 sources older than 10 Myr, still surrounded by protoplanetary disks and with ongoing accretion activities, significantly improving the census of the category known as the Peter Pan disks. The stellar parameters, variability and accretion properties of these objects, as well as their spatial distribution, are investigated. Nearly all of these objects are distributed far away from nearby associations and star forming regions, but show evidence of being members of open clusters. Investigating the correlation between mass accretion rates and stellar masses, we find these long-lived disks accrete at systematically lower levels, compared to their younger counterparts with similar stellar masses. Studying the evolution of mass accretion rates with stellar ages, we find these aged disks follow similar trend as young ones.","['Xiao-Long Wang', 'Min Fang', 'Yao Liu', 'Miao-Miao Zhang', 'Wen-Yuan Cui']",12.0,24.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04295,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,AJ,,['Young Stellar Objects — Accretion and accretion disks — Protoplanetary disks — LAMOST — Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams Corresponding author: Min Fang xlwang@hebtu'],2025-01-09

Influence of Planetary Rotation on Supersonic Flow of Lava Planets: A Two-Dimensional Horizontal Model Analysis,"The study of lava planets has attracted significant attention recently because of their close proximity to their host stars, which enhances their detectability for atmospheric characterization. Previous studies showed that the atmospheric flow becomes supersonic if the atmosphere was dominated by rocky vapor evaporated from the magma ocean around the substellar point of small lava planets. These studies often assumed an axisymmetric flow about the axis from the substellar point to the antistellar point but ignored the effect of planetary rotation on the climate. The spin rate of lava planets can be rather fast due to their close-in orbits, which can break the aforementioned symmetry and induce the asymmetric flow component. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional framework to explore the influence of planetary rotation on the atmospheric dynamics of these lava planets for the first time, and assess the sensitivity and range of application of our model. Starting from the established one-dimensional axisymmetric atmospheric solution, we obtain the governing equation for the asymmetric flow by expanding with respect to 1/Ro (Ro denotes Rossby number and exceeds unity for typical lava planets). The asymmetric component of supersonic flow is pivotal for future research on the observation of these atmospheres, flow patterns of the magma ocean currents driven by atmospheric winds, and deformation of the planetary shape over long timescales.","['Zhuo-Yang Song', 'Feng Ding', 'Wanying Kang']",9.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04350,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-09
Confirmation of four hot Jupiters detected by TESS using follow-up spectroscopy from MaHPS at Wendelstein together with NEID and TRES,"We report the confirmation and characterization of four hot Jupiter-type exoplanets initially detected by TESS: TOI-1295 b, TOI-2580 b, TOI-6016 b, and TOI-6130 b. Using observations with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph MaHPS on the 2.1m telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, together with NEID at Kitt Peak National Observatory and TRES at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, we confirmed the planetary nature of these four planet candidates. We also performed precise mass measurements. All four planets are found to be hot Jupiters with orbital periods between 2.4 and 4.0 days. The sizes of these planets range from 1.29 to 1.64 Jupiter radii, while their masses range from 0.6 to 1.5 Jupiter masses. Additionally, we investigated whether there are signs of other planets in the systems but have found none. Lastly, we compared the radii of our four objects to the results of an empirical study of radius inflation and see that all four demonstrate a good fit with the current models. These four planets belong to the first array of planets confirmed with MaHPS data, supporting the ability of the spectrograph to detect planets around fainter stars as faint as V=12.","['Juliana Ehrhardt', 'Luis Thomas', 'Hanna Kellermann', 'Christine Freitag', 'Frank Grupp', 'Samuel W.

The evolution of the flux-size relationship in protoplanetary discs by viscous evolution and radial pebble drift,"In this paper we study the evolution of radiative fluxes, flux radii and observable dust masses in protoplanetary discs, in order to understand how these depend on the angular momentum budget and on the assumed heat sources. We use a model that includes the formation and viscous evolution of protoplanetary gas discs, together with the growth and radial drift of the dust component. We find that we are best able to match the observed fluxes and radii of class 0/I discs when we assume (i) an initial total angular momentum budget corresponding to a centrifugal radius of 40 au around solar-like stars, and (ii) inefficient viscous heating. Fluxes and radii of class II discs appear consistent with disc models with angular momentum budgets equivalent to centrifugal radii of both 40 au or 10 au for solar like stars, and with models where viscous heating occurs at either full efficiency or at reduced efficiency. During the first 0.5 Myr of their evolution discs are generally optically thick at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. However, after this discs are optically thin at mm-wavelengths, supporting standard means of dust mass estimates. Using a disc population synthesis model, we then show that the evolution of the cumulative evolution of the observable dust masses agrees well with that observed in young star forming clusters of different ages.","['Johan Appelgren', 'Anders Johansen', 'Michiel Lambrechts', 'Jes Jørgensen', 'Nienke van der Marel', 'Nagayoshi Ohashi', 'John Tobin']",12.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04411,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Protoplanetary disks – Planets and satellites: formation – Methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-09
JWST photometry and astrometry of 47 Tucanae. Discontinuity in the stellar sequence at the star/brown dwarf transition,"Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 27$. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around $\sim$ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 24$ and $m_{\rm F150W2} \sim 25$. This feature, dubbed ""kink"", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH$_4$ absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.","['M. Scalco', 'R. Gerasimov', 'L. R. Bedin', 'E. Vesperini', 'M. Correnti', 'D. Nardiello', 'A.

Rapid Automated Mapping of Clouds on Titan With Instance Segmentation,"Despite widespread adoption of deep learning models to address a variety of computer vision tasks, planetary science has yet to see extensive utilization of such tools to address its unique problems. On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.","['Zachary Yahn', 'Douglas M Trent', 'Ethan Duncan', 'Benoît Seignovert', 'John Santerre', 'Conor Nixon']",0.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04459,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Image and Video Processing']",,JGR Machine Learning and Computation (2025),[],2025-01-09
ALMA observations of CO isotopologues towards six obscured post-AGB stars,"Low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when an efficient mass-loss process removes a significant fraction of their initial mass. A substantial increase in the mass-loss rate at the end of the AGB is observed for at least some stars for unknown reasons. This creates post-AGB objects that are completely enshrouded in thick dusty envelopes and might be associated with binary interactions. We observed the $J=2-1$ line of $^{13}$CO, C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards six obscured post-AGB stars (four C-rich and two O-rich sources) to constrain the properties of their circumstellar envelopes, recent mass-loss histories, and initial mass of the central stars. Based on the inferred $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O isotopic ratios, we find all stars to have relatively low initial masses ($< 2~M_\odot$) contrary to suggestions in the literature of higher masses for some sources. We infer a mass for HD~187885 $\sim 1.15~M_\odot$, which is relatively low for a carbon star. For all but one source (GLMP~950), we observe kinematic components with velocities $\gtrsim 30$~km~s$^{-1}$, which are faster than typical AGB wind expansion velocities. For most sources, these higher-velocity outflows display point-symmetric morphologies. The case of Hen~3-1475 is particularly spectacular, with the high-velocity molecular outflow interleaved with the high-velocity outflow of ionised gas observed at optical wavelengths. Based on the size of the emission regions of the slow components of the outflows, we derive typical kinematic ages associated with the C$^{18}$O~$J=2-1$ emission $\lesssim 1500$~years and obtain relatively high associated mass-loss rates ($\gtrsim10^{-4}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The sources with known spectral types are found to have evolved faster than expected based on stellar evolutionary models.","['T. Khouri', 'D. Tafoya', 'W. H. T. Vlemmings', 'H. Olofsson', 'C.

Searching the non-accreting white dwarf population in eROSITA data,"eROSITA is the soft X-ray instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite that is most sensitive in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.3 keV. Between December 2019 and December 2021, eROSITA completed four all-sky surveys producing all-sky X-ray source lists and sky maps of unprecedented depth. In the energy range between 0.2 keV and 1 keV, we detected about 38,000 sources with a hardness ratio below -0.94, covering a small sample of known white dwarfs found with eROSITA in the dataset to which the German eROSITA consortium has rights (half sky). 264 of these soft sources have a probability of more than 90 % to be a white dwarf. This is more than the 175 white dwarfs ROSAT found in the whole sky. Here we present the results of a pilot study to increase the sensitivity of eROSITA for soft sources by extending the detection threshold down to 0.1 keV. First tests with dedicated sky regions are promising.","['S. Friedrich', 'C. Maitra', 'K. Dennerl', 'A. Schwope', 'K. Werner', 'B.

The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE. IV. Unveiling the hidden structures in DR18,"The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.","['W.-J.

"NGTS-EB, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary","Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.","['Toby Rodel', 'Christopher.

Spectral Study of Aql~X-1 during \textit{Pulse-on} and \textit{Pulse-off} Stages,"We present a detailed spectral study of an intermittent-AMXP Aql X-1 during the \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages by using the archival RXTE data. We first perform temporal analysis by using Z$_n^2$ technique in three different energy bands, 3.0 -- 13.0~keV, 13.0 -- 23.0~keV and 23.0 -- 33.0~keV, for the last 128~s time segment of the RXTE data including \textit{pulse-on} region. We show that the pulse is the most significant in the softest band. We, then, show that the spectrum is represented the best via combination of absorbed blackbody, disk blackbody and a gaussian line. We modeled the last four segments of the data 30188-03-05-00 to better compare \textit{pulse-on} and \textit{pulse-off} stages. We found a vague residual in the spectral fit of the \textit{pulse-on} segment between $\sim$3.0 -- 13.0~keV which agrees with the result of temporal analysis. We show that the residual may be represented with an extra blackbody component with the temperature of 1.75~keV and the radius of 0.75$\pm$0.49 km. For deeper analysis, we performed phase-resolved spectroscopy to the last 128~s, \textit{pulse-on}, segment. We obtain two separate spectra for the spin phase range of 0.75 -- 0.25, \textit{pulse-high} and 0.25 -- 0.75, \textit{pulse-low} and followed the same procedure. We display that the residual becomes more clear for \textit{pulse-high} compared to the \textit{pulse-low}. We report that the additional blackbody component, which models the residual, indicates a hotspot from the surface of the neutron star with the radius of 1.65$\pm$0.74 km whose temperature is 1.65 keV.","['T.

The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae,"We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to <60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20<delta<60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.","['Ido Avitan', 'Noam Soker']",6.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04549,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['outflows – planetary nebulae: general 1', 'stars: jets – stars: AGB and post-AGB – binaries: close – stars: winds']",2025-01-09
Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs,"The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.","['Pantelis Pnigouras', 'Samuel K.

MINDS. The influence of outer dust disc structure on the volatile delivery to the inner disc,"ALMA has revealed that the millimetre dust structures of protoplanetary discs are extremely diverse. It has been proposed that the strength of H$_2$O emission in the inner disc particularly depends on the influx of icy pebbles from the outer disc, a process that would correlate with the outer dust disc radius, and that could be prevented by pressure bumps. This work aims to assess the influence of pressure bumps on the inner disc's molecular reservoirs. Using JWST's MIRI/MRS, we compared the observational emission properties of H$_2$O, HCN, C$_2$H$_2$, and CO$_2$ with the outer dust disc structure from ALMA observations, in eight discs with confirmed gaps in ALMA observations, and two discs with gaps of tens of astronomical units in width, around stars with $M_\star \geq 0.45M_{\odot}$. We used new visibility plane fits of the ALMA data to determine the outer dust disc radius and identify substructures in the discs. We find that the presence of a dust gap does not necessarily result in weak H$_2$O emission. Furthermore, the relative lack of colder H$_2$O-emission seems to go hand in hand with elevated emission from carbon-bearing species. The discs with cavities and extremely wide gaps appear to behave as a somewhat separate group, with stronger cold H$_2$O emission and weak warm H$_2$O emission. We conclude that fully blocking radial dust drift from the outer disc seems difficult to achieve. However, there does seem to be a dichotomy between discs that show a strong cold H$_2$O excess and ones that show strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$. Better constraints on the influence of the outer dust disc structure and inner disc composition require more information on substructure formation timescales and disc ages, along with the importance of trapping of volatiles like CO and CO$_2$ into more strongly bound ices like H$_2$O and chemical transformation of CO into less volatile species.","['Danny Gasman', 'Milou Temmink', 'Ewine F. van Dishoeck', 'Nicolas T.

Vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc from SDSS/Gaia,"[Abbreviated] Context: Studies of the LMC's internal kinematics have provided a detailed view of its structure, largely by the exquisite proper motion data supplied by Gaia. However, LoS velocities are only available for a small subset of Gaia data, limiting studies of the kinematics perpendicular to the LMC disc plane. Aims: We synergise new SDSS-IV/V LoS velocity measurements with Gaia data, increasing the 5D phase-space sample by almost a factor of three. We interpret and model the vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc. Methods: Split our sample into different stellar types. Then examine maps of vertical velocity moments perpendicular to the LMC disc. We interpret our results within three possible scenarios: 1) time-variability in the orientation of the disc symmetry axis; 2) use of an incorrect LMC disc plane orientation; or 3) the presence of warps or twists in the LMC disc. We also present a new method to construct a continuous 3D representation of the disc from spatially-resolved measurements of its viewing angles. Results: Using young stellar populations, we identify a region in the LMC arm with highly negative v_z'; this overlaps spatially with the supershell LMC 4. Our results indicate that: 1) the LMC viewing angles may vary with time, but this cannot explain most of the structure in v_z' maps; 2) when re-deriving the LMC disc plane by minimising the RMS vertical velocity v_z' across the disc, the inclination and line-of-nodes position angle are i ~ 24 degr and \Omega ~ 327 degr, respectively; 3) we obtain different inclinations for the inner and outer disc regions, and a quadrupolar variation with azimuth in outer the disc. We provide 3D models of the LMC disc shape. Conclusions: The combination of SDSS-IV/V and Gaia data reveal that the LMC disc is not a flat plane in equilibrium, but that the central bar region is tilted relative to a warped outer disc.","['Ó.

Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations,"We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the ""hit-and-stick"" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $< 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.","['Chuchu Xiang', 'Nina Merkert', 'Lorin S.

Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law,"Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.","['Ruben Lier', 'Akash Jain', 'Jay Armas', 'Oliver Porth']",2.0,14.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04638,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-09
Effort: a fast and differentiable emulator for the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe,"We present the official release of the EFfective Field theORy surrogaTe (Effort), a novel and efficient emulator designed for the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). This tool combines state-of-the-art numerical methods and clever preprocessing strategies to achieve exceptional computational performance without sacrificing accuracy. To validate the emulator reliability, we compare Bayesian posteriors sampled using Effort via Hamiltonian MonteCarlo methods to the ones sampled using the widely-used pybird code, via the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. On a large-volume set of simulations, and on the BOSS dataset, the comparison confirms excellent agreement, with deviations compatible with MonteCarlo noise.

Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies,"Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.","['Aman Gupta', 'Pooja Bhattacharjee', 'Pratik Majumdar']",6.0,25.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04663,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,"['light-long-lived mediator', 'gamma-ray analysis', 'Sommerfeld enhancementarXiv:2501', 'indirect detection', 'Dark matter', 'dwarf spheroidal galaxy']",2025-01-09
Cosmological Perturbations from a New Approach to Inflation,"In a previous paper we proposed a new approach to the beginning of inflation -- a lingering universe. The universe begins in a lingering state with a nearly vanishing Hubble parameter. This calls into question the absolute age of the universe, as the Hubble time can be nearly infinite. It also provides promise for addressing the initial singularity of inflation and issues with quantum field theory in de Sitter space-time. Such models arise in classical cosmologies with non-vanishing spatial curvature (inspired by PLANCK 2018 data), and independently by models that arise in string cosmology. In this paper, we consider the importance of cosmological perturbations for the stability of the lingering phase and how this influences cosmological observations. Our goal is to establish observables in this new paradigm for the origin of inflation which is in contrast to eternal inflation and cyclic cosmologies. We also address questions of stability and the transition to inflation.","['Brandon Melcher', 'Arnab Pradhan', 'Scott Watson']",13.0,32.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04669,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology', 'High Energy Physics - Theory']",,,[],2025-01-09
A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters,"Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q>0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q<0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.","['R. Gratton', 'M. Bonavita', 'D. Mesa', 'S.

The Forward Physics Facility at the HL-LHC and its Synergies with Astroparticle Physics,"High-energy collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a vast flux of particles along the beam collision axis, a region not accessible by current LHC experiments. The study of multi-particle production in the far-forward region is especially important for astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays create extensive air showers (EAS) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions in the non-perturbative QCD regime. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is crucial for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for searches of astrophysical neutrinos, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC, hosting various far-forward experiments designed to detect particles outside the current LHC acceptance. We will outline the current plans for the FPF and highlight its synergies with astroparticle physics. Specifically, we will discuss how FPF measurements will enhance the modeling of high-energy interactions in the atmosphere, helping to reduce the associated uncertainties in multi-messenger astrophysics.",['Dennis Soldin'],6.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04714,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['High Energy Physics - Experiment'],,,[],2025-01-10

From proto-neutron star dynamo to low-field magnetars,"Low-field magnetars have dipolar magnetic fields that are 10-100 times weaker than the threshold, $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G, used to define classical magnetars, yet they produce similar X-ray bursts and outbursts. Using the first direct numerical simulations of magneto-thermal evolution starting from a dynamo-generated magnetic field, we show that the low-field magnetars can be produced as a result of a Tayler--Spruit dynamo inside the proto-neutron star. We find that these simulations naturally explain key characteristics of low-field magnetars: (1) weak ($\lesssim 10^{13}$ G) dipolar magnetic fields, (2) strong small-scale fields, and (3) magnetically induced crustal failures producing X-ray bursts. These findings suggest two distinct formation channels for classical and low-field magnetars, potentially linked to different dynamo mechanisms.","['Andrei Igoshev', 'Paul Barrère', 'Raphaël Raynaud', 'Jérome Guilet', 'Toby Wood', 'Rainer Hollerbach']",11.0,25.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04768,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,a journal,,"['neutron stars', 'X-ray Magnetars play a special role in modern high-energy astrophysics', 'dynamo', 'magnetars']",2025-01-10
Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory,"We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.","['Anton Chudaykin', 'Mikhail M.

Deep Photometric Observations of Ultra-Faint Milky Way Satellites Centaurus I and Eridanus IV,"We present deep Magellan$+$Megacam imaging of Centaurus I (Cen I) and Eridanus IV (Eri IV), two recently discovered Milky Way ultra-faint satellites. Our data reach $\sim2-3$ magnitudes deeper than the discovery data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey. We use these data to constrain their distances, structural properties (e.g., half-light radii, ellipticity, and position angle), and luminosities. We investigate whether these systems show signs of tidal disturbance, and identify new potential member stars using Gaia EDR3. Our deep color-magnitude diagrams show that Cen I and Eri IV are consistent with an old ($\tau\sim 13.0$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\text{[Fe/H]}\le-2.2$) stellar population. We find Cen I to have a half-light radius of $r_{h}=2.60\pm0.30'$ ($90.6\pm11$ pc), an ellipticity of $\epsilon=0.36\pm0.05$, a distance of $D=119.8\pm4.1$ kpc ($m-M=20.39\pm0.08$ mag), and an absolute magnitude of $M_{V}=-5.39\pm0.19$. Similarly, Eri IV has $r_{h}=3.24\pm0.48'$ ($65.9\pm10$ pc), $\epsilon=0.26\pm0.09$, $D=69.9\pm3.6$ kpc ($m-M=19.22\pm0.11$ mag), and $M_{V}=-3.55\pm0.24$. These systems occupy a space on the size-luminosity plane consistent with other known Milky Way dwarf galaxies which supports the findings from our previous spectroscopic follow-up. Cen I has a well-defined morphology which lacks any clear evidence of tidal disruption, whereas Eri IV hosts a significant extended feature with multiple possible interpretations.","['Quinn O.

Constraining $\gamma$-ray dissipation site in gravitationally lensed quasar -- PKS 1830$-$211,"Variable $\gamma$-ray flares upto minute timescales reflect extreme particle acceleration sites. However, for high-redshift blazars, the detection of such rapid variations remains limited by current telescope sensitivities. Gravitationally lensed blazars serve as powerful tools to probe $\gamma$-ray production zones in distant sources, with time delays between lensed signals providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of emission regions relative to the lens's mass-weighted center. We have utilized 15 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data from direction of PKS 1830$-$211 to understand the origin of flaring high-energy production zone at varying flux states. To efficiently estimate the (lensed) time delay, we used a machine learning-based tool - the Gaussian Process regression algorithm, in addition to - Autocorrelation function and Double power spectrum. We found a consistent time delay across all flaring activity states, indicating a similar location for the $\gamma$-ray emission zone, possibly within the radio core. The estimated time delay of approximately 20 days for the five flaring epochs was significantly shorter than previously estimated radio delays. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone is closer to the central engine, in contrast to the radio emission zone, which is expected to be much farther away. A linear relationship between lag and magnification has been observed in the identified source and echo flares. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission zone originates from similar regions away from the site of radio dissipation.","['Sushmita Agarwa', 'Amit Shukla', 'Pranjali Sharma']",10.0,11.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04775,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,MNRAS,,['gravitational lensing: strong - methods: statistical - galaxies: active - galaxies: high-redshift - galaxies: jets - gamma-rays: galaxies 1 INTRODUCTION TheaccretionofmatterontosupermassiveblackholespowersActive GalacticNuclei(AGN)'],2025-01-10
Impact of accretion-induced chemically homogeneous evolution on stellar and compact binary populations,"In binary star systems, mass transfer can spin up the accretor, possibly leading to efficient chemical mixing and chemically quasi-homogeneous evolution (CHE). Here, we explore the effects of accretion-induced CHE on both stellar populations and their compact binary remnants with the state-of-the-art population synthesis code SEVN. We find that CHE efficiently enhances the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) from secondary stars, which are spun-up by accretion, while simultaneously preventing their evolution into red supergiant stars (RSGs). Including CHE in our models increases the fraction of WRs in our stellar sample by nearly a factor of $\approx3$ at low metallicity ($Z=0.001$). WRs formed through CHE are, on average, more massive and luminous than those formed without CHE. Most WRs formed via CHE end their life as black holes. As a direct consequence, the CHE mechanism enhances the formation of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) systems, while simultaneously quenching the production of binary neutron stars (BNSs). However, CHE significantly quenches the merger rate of BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs at low metallicity ($Z\leq{}0.004$), because most binary compact objects formed via CHE have large orbital periods. For instance, the number of BBH and BHNS mergers decreases by one order of magnitude at $Z=0.004$ in the CHE model compared to the standard scenario. Finally, we find that secondary stars experiencing CHE frequently produce the most massive compact object in the binary system. In BHNSs, this implies that the black hole progenitor is the secondary star. Conversely, BBHs formed through accretion-induced CHE likely have asymmetric black hole components, but only a negligible fraction of these asymmetric systems ultimately merge within an Hubble time.","[""Marco Dall'Amico"", 'Michela Mapelli', 'Giuliano Iorio', 'Guglielmo Costa', 'Stéphane Charlot', 'Erika Korb', 'Cecilia Sgalletta', 'Marie Lecroq']",12.0,28.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04778,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",,,['Methods: numerical - Stars: Wolf-Rayet - Stars: black holes - Binaries: general - Gravitational waves 1'],2025-01-10

The Evolution of Half-Mass Radii and Color Gradients for Young and Old Quiescent Galaxies at $0.5 < z < 3$ with JWST/PRIMER,"We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between $0.5<z<3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$>10$, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-$M_*$/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio $r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7$\mu$m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, $10<$log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$<11$, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5<z<3$.

We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.","['Tobias Röspel', 'Adrian Schlosser', 'Björn Malte Schäfer']",7.0,9.0,7.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04791,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,"['information entropy', 'Bayesian evidence', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo', 'normalising flows', 'supernova cosmology 1', 'inference in cosmology']",2025-01-10
Effective resistivity in relativistic reconnection: a prescription based on fully kinetic simulations,"A variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena are powered by the release -- via magnetic reconnection -- of the energy stored in oppositely directed fields. Single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with uniform resistivity yield dissipation rates that are much lower (by nearly one order of magnitude) than equivalent kinetic calculations. Reconnection-driven phenomena could be accordingly modeled in resistive MHD employing a non-uniform, ``effective'' resistivity informed by kinetic calculations. In this work, we analyze a suite of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection -- where the magnetic energy is greater than the rest mass energy -- for different strengths of the guide field orthogonal to the alternating component. We extract an empirical prescription for the effective resistivity, $\eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \alpha B_0 \mathbf{|J|}^p / \left(|\mathbf{J}|^{p+1}+\left(e n_t c\right)^{p+1}\right)$, where $B_0$ is the reconnecting magnetic field strength, $\bf J$ is the current density, $n_t$ the lab-frame total number density, $e$ the elementary charge, and $c$ the speed of light. The guide field dependence is encoded in $\alpha$ and $p$, which we fit to PIC data. This resistivity formulation -- which relies only on single-fluid MHD quantities -- successfully reproduces the spatial structure and strength of nonideal electric fields, and thus provides a promising strategy for enhancing the reconnection rate in resistive MHD simulations.","['Abigail Moran', 'Lorenzo Sironi', 'Aviad Levis', 'Bart Ripperda', 'Elias R.

Mind the Gap II: the near-UV fluxes of M dwarfs,"Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf stars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of utilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two distinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the $M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number of stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\sim9.4$, coinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy transportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood stellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the effective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at $\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass, contributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two populations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and young stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with bright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.","['Wei-Chun Jao', 'Allison Youngblood']",10.0,20.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04806,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['M dwarf stars (982) — Main sequence stars(1000) — Stellar chromospheres(230) — Ultra- violet photometry(1740) 1'],2025-01-10

Structures of various types of symmetry in the solar activity cycle,"The solar cycle is a complex phenomenon. To comprehensively understand it, we have to study various tracers. The most important component of this complex is the solar dynamo, which is understood as self-excitation of the solar magnetic field in the form of traveling waves somewhere in the convection zone. Along with the solar dynamo, the formation of the solar cycle involves other processes that are associated with the dynamo but are not its necessary part. We give a review of such phenomena that have not yet been explained in terms of dynamo theory. We consider the manifestations of the solar cycle in harmonics of the solar large-scale surface magnetic field, including zonal, sectorial, and tesseral harmonics; analyze their contribution to magnetic energy; and identify phases of the activity cycle using harmonics of different types of symmetry. The universal magnetic scenario of a solar activity cycle does not depend on its number and height. At the beginning of the cycle on the photosphere, the zonal harmonics account for 37-42% of the total energy (not 100%, as assumed in simplified descriptions). Sectorial harmonics do not disappear at all but account for 5-10% of the total energy. At this stage, the greatest energy (about 40%) is contained in the tesseral harmonics. As the cycle develops, the relative energy of zonal harmonics gradually decreases, reaching a minimum of 15-18% immediately before the onset of the sunspot maximum. The relative energy of sectorial harmonics increases and reaches a maximum (60-65%) somewhat later than the calendar date of the sunspot maximum. A particular feature of the tesseral harmonics is that their relative energy index changes in a much narrower range and never falls below 40% even at the cycle minimum. This is due to active regions and nonglobal magnetic fields. It is possible that tesseral harmonics are formed in shallow subphotospheric layers.","['V.N. Obridko', 'A.S. Shibalova', 'D.D.

"Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code","Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.","['Riley Rosener', 'Michael Zhang', 'Jacob L.

Identifying Flare Locations Through Exoplanet Transit Occultations,"M dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, with long lifespans, a high occurrence rate of rocky planets, and close-in habitable zones. However, high stellar activity in the form of frequent flaring and any associated coronal mass ejections may drive atmospheric escape with the bombardment of radiation and high-energy particles, drastically impacting the habitability of these systems. The stellar latitude where flares and coronal mass ejections occur determines the space weather that exoplanets are subject to, with high-energy particle events associated with equatorial flares producing significant atmospheric erosion. However, the flaring latitudes for M dwarfs remain largely unconstrained. To aid in the effort to locate these flaring regions we explore the applicability of flare occultations using optical photometry to identify the latitudes of flares. As a planet transits in front of an ongoing flare the timing and geometry of the transit can be used to constrain the latitude and longitude of the flare. We predict the probability of detecting an occultation for known transiting planets and eclipsing binaries. From this, we estimate 3-22 detectable occultations exist within the TESS primary mission photometry, with the majority occurring in eclipsing binary observations. To demonstrate this technique, we analyze a candidate flare occultation event for the eclipsing binary CM Draconis.","['Tayt Armitage', 'David V.

Parallactic delay for geodetic VLBI and non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes,"The Gaia optical astrometric mission has measured the precise positions of millions of objects in the sky, including extragalactic sources also observed by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the recent Gaia EDR3 release, an effect of negative parallax with a magnitude of approximately -17 $\mu$as was reported, presumably due to technical reasons related to the relativistic delay model. A recent analysis of a 30-year set of geodetic VLBI data revealed a similar negative parallax with an amplitude of $-15.8 \pm 0.5$ $ \mu$as. Since both astrometric techniques, optical and radio, provide consistent estimates of this negative parallax, it is necessary to investigate the potential origin of this effect. We developed the extended group relativistic delay model to incorporate the additional parallactic effect for radio sources at distances less than 1 Mpc and found that the apparent annual signal might appear due the non-orthogonality of the fundamental axes, which are defined by the positions of the reference radio sources themselves. Unlike the conventional parallactic ellipse, the apparent annual effect in this case appears as a circular motion for all objects independently of their ecliptic latitude. The measured amplitude of this circular effect is within a range of 10-15 $\mu$as that is consistent with the ICRF3 stability of the fundamental axis. This annual circular effect could also arise if a Gödel-type cosmological metric were applied, suggesting that, in the future, this phenomenon could be used to indicate global cosmic rotation.","['Oleg Titov', 'Angelina Osetrova']",3.0,6.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04872,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Volume 41, 2024, e111",[],2025-01-10
GRB 241030A: a prompt thermal X-ray emission component and diverse origin of the very early UVOT WHITE and U band emission,"We present a detailed analysis of the long-duration GRB 241030A detected by {\it Swift}. Thanks to the rapid response of XRT and UVOT, the strongest part of the prompt emission of GRB 241030A has been well measured simultaneously from optical to hard X-ray band. The time-resolved WHITE band emission shows strong variability, largely tracing the activity of the prompt gamma-ray emission, may be produced by internal shocks too. The joint analysis of the XRT and BAT data reveals the presence of a thermal component with a temperature of a few keV, which can be interpreted as the photosphere radiation, and the upper limit of the Lorentz factor of this region is found to range between approximately 20 and 80. The time-resolved analysis of the initial U-band exposure data yields a very rapid rise ($ \sim t^{5.3}$) with a bright peak reaching 13.6 AB magnitude around 410 seconds, which is most likely attributed to the onset of the external shock emission. The richness and fineness of early observational data have made this burst a unique sample for studying the various radiation mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts.","['Qiu-Li Wang', 'Hao Zhou', 'Yun Wang', 'Jia Ren', 'Samaporn Tinyanont', 'Dong Xu', 'Ning-Chen Sun', 'Johan P.U.

Another piece to the puzzle: radio detection of a JWST discovered AGN candidate,"Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots"" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} < 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.","['Anniek J.

Peculiar radio-bright behaviour of the Galactic black hole transient 4U 1543-47 in the 2021-2023 outburst,"Correlated behaviours between the radio emission and the X-ray emission in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) in the X-ray hard state are crucial to the understanding of disc-jet coupling of accreting black holes. The BH transient 4U 1543-47 went into outburst in 2021 following ~19 years of quiescence. We followed it up with ~weekly cadence with MeerKAT for about one year and a half until it faded into quiescence. Multi-epoch quasi-simultaneous MeerKAT and X-ray observations allowed us to trace the compact jet emission and its X-ray emission. In its hard spectral state across three orders of magnitude of X-ray luminosities above ~10$^{34}$ ergs/s, we found the correlation between radio and X-ray emission had a power-law index of 0.82$\pm$0.09, steeper than the canonical value of ~0.6 for BH XRBs. In addition, the radio vs. X-ray correlation shows a large range of the power-law normalization, with the maximum significantly larger than that obtained for most BH XRBs, indicating it can be particularly radio-bright and variable in the X-ray binary sample. The radio emission is unlikely diluted by discrete jet components. The observed peculiar radio-bright and variable behaviours provide the evidence for the relativistic effects of a variable Lorentz factor in the range between 1 and ~2 of the compact jet.","['X.

To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.","['C.S.

The Catalogue of Virtual Early-Type Galaxies from IllustrisTNG: Validation and Real Observation Consistency,"Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are reference systems to understand galaxy formation and evolution processes. The physics of their collapse and internal dynamics are codified in well-known scaling relations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations play an important role, providing insights into the 3D distribution of matter and galaxy formation mechanisms, as well as validating methods to infer the properties of real objects. In this work, we present the closest-to-reality sample of ETGs from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation, dubbed ""virtual-ETGs,"" based on an observational-like algorithm that combines standard projected and three-dimensional galaxy structural parameters. We extract 2D photometric information by projecting the galaxies' light into three planes and modeling them via Sérsic profiles. Aperture velocity dispersions, corrected for softened central dynamics, are calculated along the line-of-sight orthogonal to the photometric projection plane. Central mass density profiles assume a power-law model, while 3D masses remain unmodified from the IllustrisTNG catalogue. The final catalogue includes $10121$ galaxies at redshifts $z \leq 0.1$. By comparing the virtual properties with observations, we find that the virtual-ETG scaling relations (e.g., size-mass, size-central surface brightness, and Faber-Jackson), central density slopes, and scaling relations among total density slopes and galaxy structural parameters are generally consistent with observations. We make the virtual-ETG publicly available for galaxy formation studies and plan to use this sample as a training set for machine learning tools to infer galaxy properties in future imaging and spectroscopic surveys.","['Pedro de Araujo Ferreira', 'Nicola R.

Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS): survey overview and the result of global mass-metallicity relation,"Low-mass galaxies are the building blocks of massive galaxies in the framework of hierarchical structure formation. To enable detailed studies of galactic ecosystems in dwarf galaxies by spatially resolving different galactic components, we have carried out the Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS). This survey aims to acquire observations with spatial resolutions as high as 10 to 100 pc while maintaining reasonably high signal-to-noise ratios with VLT/MUSE and ANU-2.3m/WiFeS. The whole sample will be composed of 65 dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm \ast}$ $<$ 10$^{9}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, selected from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Survey. The overall scientific goals include studying baryonic cycles in dwarf galaxies, searching for off-nuclear (intermediate)-massive black holes, and quantifying the inner density profiles of dark matter. In this work, we describe the sample selection, data reduction, and high-level data products. By integrating the spectra over the field of view for each galaxy, we obtained the integrated gas-phase metallicity and discussed its dependence on stellar mass and SFR. We find that the overall relation between metallicity and stellar mass of our DGIS nearly follows the extrapolation from the higher mass end. Its dispersion does not decrease by invoking the dependence on SFR.","['Xin Li', 'Yong Shi', 'Fuyan Bian', 'Xiaoling Yu', 'Zhiyuan Zheng', 'Songlin Li', 'Yanmei Chen', 'Qiusheng Gu', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Shude Mao', 'Xiangdong Li', 'Hongxin Zhang', 'Kai Zhu', 'Zhiyu Zhang']",24.0,40.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04943,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['surveys — galaxies: dwarf(65) — galaxies: fundamental parameters — methods: data analysis — ISM: abundances 1'],2025-01-10
Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation,"Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to use the realistic galaxies' Probability Distribution Function (PDF) that describes each galaxy redshift to select samples and include in the fitting model as the input for the redshift uncertainty. We used four different photo-z estimators \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \texttt{Pz Cats}. Furthermore, for each algorithm, we selected two different samples according to the PDFs shape, one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and the other that chooses the least noisy PDFs in which the PDFs have one pronounced peak. We computed the correlation function $\xi_\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{eff}$, We concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \texttt{ANNz2} is the best photo-z estimator for BAO analysis considering the realistic full probability distribution function of each galaxy.","['Paula S.

Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars,"$r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.","['Wenhao Dong', 'Andrew Melatos']",1.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04968,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",MNRAS,,"['whoserestoring force is the Coriolis force', 'accretion discs – asteroseismology – gravitational waves – stars: neutron – stars: oscillations – stars: rotation 1 INTRODUCTION 𝑟-modesareinertialmodesinrotatingneutronstars', 'accretion']",2025-01-10
The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) VI: The RACS-high 1655.5 MHz images and catalogue,"We have conducted a widefield, wideband, snapshot survey using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) referred to as the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). RACS covers $\approx$ 90% of the sky, with multiple observing epochs in three frequency bands sampling the ASKAP frequency range of 700 to 1800 MHz.

Multiple Populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2257: No Major Environmental Effect on the Formation of Multiple Populations of the Old Globular Clusters in Large Magellanic Cloud,"How the environment of the host galaxy affects the formation of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the outstanding questions in the near-field cosmology. To understand the true nature of the old GC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry of the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated populational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\pm$4), where the FG and SG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar cumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is dynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\pm$0.00 dex($\sigma$=0.05 dex) and our metallicity is $\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution spectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\sim$ $-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than the SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to Galactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic of GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium enhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit that the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with the GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass. We show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in the $\Delta$W$_{\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\rm FG}/N_{\rm tot}$, and $\log M/M_{\rm \odot}$ domains.

Anisotropic diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,"The origin of cosmic rays (CRs) and how they propagate remain unclear. Studying the propagation of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can help to comprehend many open issues related to CR origin and the role of turbulent magnetic fields. To comprehend the phenomenon of slow diffusion in the near-source region, we study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field to reveal their universal laws. We numerically study the interactions of CRs with the ambient turbulent magnetic field, considering pulsar wind nebula as a general research case. Taking the magnetization parameter and turbulence spectral index as free parameters, together with radiative losses, we perform three group simulations to analyze the CR spectral, spatial distributions, and possible CR diffusion types. Our studies demonstrate that (1) CR energy density decays with both its effective radius and kinetic energy in the form of power-law distributions; (2) the morphology of the CR spatial distribution strongly depends on the properties of magnetic turbulence and the viewing angle; (3) CRs suffer a slow diffusion near the source and a fast/normal diffusion away from the source; (4) the existence of a power-law relationship between the averaged CR energy density and the magnetization parameter is independent of both CR energy and radiative losses; (5) radiative losses can suppress CR anisotropic diffusion and soften the power-law distribution of CR energy density. The distribution law established between turbulent magnetic fields and CRs presents an intrinsic property, providing a convenient way to understand complex astrophysical processes related to turbulence cascades.","['Na-Na Gao', 'Jian-Fu Zhang']",8.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04986,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,A&A,,['galaxies: ISM – galaxies: magnetic fields – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – ISM: cosmic rays – ISM: di ffusion 1'],2025-01-10
ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects,"We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.","['Takashi Shimonishi', 'Takashi Onaka', 'Itsuki Sakon']",5.0,13.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05008,Astrophysics of Galaxies,"['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",ApJ,,['astrochemistry — ISM: molecules — radio lines: ISM 1'],2025-01-10
Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud II: the connection with the progenitors' properties,"The study of planetary nebulae (PNe) offers the opportunity of evaluating the efficiency of the dust production mechanism during the very late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. We study the relationship between the properties of PNe, particularly the gas and dust content, with the mass and metallicity of the progenitor stars, to understand how dust production works in the late AGB phases, and to shed new light on the physical processes occurring to the stars and the material in their surroundings since the departure from the AGB until the PN phase. We consider a sample of 9 PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 7 out of which characterized by the presence of carbonaceous dust, the remaining 2 with silicates. For these stars the masses and the metallicity of the progenitor stars were estimated. We combine results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling with those coming from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution, to find the relation between the dust and gas mass of the PNe considered and the The physical properties of carbon-rich PNe are influenced by the mass of the progenitor star. Specifically, the dust-to-gas ratio in the nebula increases from 5x10^{-4}to 6x10^{-3} as the progenitor star's mass increases from approximately 0.9Msun to 2Msun. This change is partly influenced by the effective temperature of the PNe, and it occurs because higher-mass carbon stars are more efficient at producing dust. Consequently, as the progenitor's mass increases, the gas mass of the PNe decreases, since the larger amounts of dust lead to greater effects from radiation pressure, which pushes the gas outwards. No meaningful conclusions can be drawn by the study of the PNe with silicate-type dust, because the sub-sample is made up of 2 PNe only, one of which is almost dust-free.","['P. Ventura', 'S.

Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations,"We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $>6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.","['Fupeng Zhang', 'Pau Amaro Seoane']",11.0,27.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05016,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['Black-hole physics – gravitation – gravitational waves – Galaxy: center – Galaxy: nucleus – relativistic processes – stars: kinematics and dynamics 1'],2025-01-10
Euclid: Detecting Solar System objects in Euclid images and classifying them using Kohonen self-organising maps,"The ESA Euclid mission will survey more than 14,000 deg$^2$ of the sky in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, mapping the extra-galactic sky to constrain our cosmological model of the Universe. Although the survey focusses on regions further than 15 deg from the ecliptic, it should allow for the detection of more than about $10^5$ Solar System objects (SSOs). After simulating the expected signal from SSOs in Euclid images acquired with the visible camera (VIS), we describe an automated pipeline developed to detect moving objects with an apparent velocity in the range of 0.1-10 arcsec/h, typically corresponding to sources in the outer Solar System (from Centaurs to Kuiper-belt objects). In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on Sourcextractor software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating moving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters to improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness of the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural network can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify stars, galaxies, and SSOs. By implementing an early-stopping method in the training scheme, we show that the network can be used in a predictive way, allowing one to assign the probability of each detected object being a member of each considered class.","['A.

Exploring the variation in the dynamic rotation profile of the hotter solar atmosphere using mutliwavelength data,"The global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation at different layers, although crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field, has been a subject to contradictory results throughout the past century. In this study, we thereby unify the results for different parts of the multi-thermal Solar atmosphere by utilizing 13 years of data in 7 wavelength channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) atop the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Using the method of image correlation, we find that the solar atmosphere exhibits a rotational profile that is up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster at the equator and comparatively less differential than that of the photosphere, as derived from Doppler measurements and sunspots, respectively and exhibits variation at different respective heights. Additionally, we find results suggestive of the role played by the rooting of different magnetic field structures on a comparison with helioseismology data.","['Srinjana Routh', 'Bibhuti Kumar Jha', 'Dibya Kirti Mishra', 'Tom Van Doorsselaere', 'Vaibhav Pant', 'Subhamoy Chatterjee', 'Dipankar Banerjee']",2.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05026,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['Sun: atmosphere', 'Sun: solar cycle', 'Sun:corona', 'Sun:activity 1', 'Sun: differential rotation']",2025-01-10
Observational Study of the Atmospheric Gravity Waves in the lower Solar Atmosphere,"The solar chromosphere exhibits a variety of waves originating from the photosphere and deeper layers, causing oscillations at different heights with distinct frequencies. This study identifies and analyze Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) and acoustic waves at various height pairs within the solar atmosphere utilising H$\alpha$, Ca II IR and Fe I 6173 A imaging spectroscopic observations from Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. We study and compare oscillations by analyzing power maps generated using velocities obtained from the filtergram difference and bisector methods. Our analysis shows a consistent increase in power with height in the solar chromosphere for both methods. In addition to this, our results show that AGWs are detected within or near magnetic flux concentration regions, where spicules are also predominant, exhibiting significant power in the chromosphere. These regions also feature inclined magnetic fields, which might be contributing to the propagation of these low-frequency AGWs in the chromosphere. Examining average power maps at spicule locations reveals significant power at AGWs frequency across different chromospheric heights. We speculate that these AGWs propagate upward along spicular structures and were not previously detected in the studies employing space-time map due to their limited lifetime. This study provides insights into the complex dynamics of solar chromospheric waves influenced by magnetic field, contributing to our understanding of AGWs and acoustic waves propagation across different layers of the solar atmosphere.","['Ravi Chaurasiya', 'Ankala Raja Bayanna']",14.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05042,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Sun: atmosphere – Sun: chromosphere – Sun: oscillations – Sun: magnetic fields 1 INTRODUCTION ThechromosphereisathinlayerintheSun’satmosphere'],2025-01-10
Fully comprehensive diagnostic of galaxy activity using principal components of visible spectra: implementation on nearby S0s,"We introduce a novel galaxy classification methodology based on the visible spectra of a sample of over 68,000 nearby ($z\leq 0.1$) Sloan Digital Sky Survey lenticular (S0) galaxies. Unlike traditional diagnostic diagrams, which rely on a limited set of emission lines and class dividers to identify ionizing sources, our approach provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing galaxies regardless of their activity level. By projecting galaxies into the 2D latent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their entire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from individual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density estimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in the new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance in our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert, composite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical distribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population, demonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant ionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic reflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our analysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently biased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII] emission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies excluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like characteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms unrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion. A machine-readable catalogue listing BPT-class probabilities for the galaxies analysed is available online at the CDS website.","['J. L. Tous', 'J. M. Solanes', 'J. D.

Time-Variant Vector Field Visualization for Magnetic Fields of Neutron Star Simulations,"We present a novel visualization application designed to explore the time-dependent development of magnetic fields of neutron stars. The strongest magnetic fields in the universe can be found within neutron stars, potentially playing a role in initiating astrophysical jets and facilitating the outflow of neutron-rich matter, ultimately resulting in the production of heavy elements during binary neutron star mergers. Since such effects may be dependent on the strength and configuration of the magnetic field, the formation and parameters of such fields are part of current research in astrophysics. Magnetic fields are investigated using simulations in which various initial configurations are tested. However, the long-term configuration is an open question, and current simulations do not achieve a stable magnetic field. Neutron star simulations produce data quantities in the range of several terabytes, which are both spatially in 3D and temporally resolved. Our tool enables physicists to interactively explore the generated data. We first convert the data in a pre-processing step and then we combine sparse vector field visualization using streamlines with dense vector field visualization using line integral convolution. We provide several methods to interact with the data responsively. This allows the user to intuitively investigate data-specific issues. Furthermore, diverse visualization techniques facilitate individual exploration of the data and enable real-time processing of specific domain tasks, like the investigation of the time-dependent evolution of the magnetic field. In a qualitative study, domain experts tested the tool, and the usability was queried. Experts rated the tool very positively and recommended it for their daily work.","['Simon J.

The impact of the redshift-dependent selection effect of halos on the redshift-space power spectrum,"In a wide-area spectroscopic survey of galaxies, it is nearly impossible to obtain a homogeneous sample of galaxies with respect to galaxy properties such as stellar mass and host halo mass across a range of redshifts. Despite the selection effect, theoretical templates in most analyses assume single tracers when compared with the measured clustering quantities. We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\lesssim 0.3~h{\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples. We also argue that the selection effect is unlikely to cause a significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters using the Fisher matrix method, provided that the redshift-dependent selection effect is modest.","['Kanmi Nose', 'Masahiro Takada', 'Ryo Terasawa']",7.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05086,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-10

The ESO SupJup Survey V: Exploring Atmospheric Variability and Orbit of the Super-Jupiter AB Pictoris b with CRIRES+,"A growing number of directly-imaged companions have been recently characterised, with robust constraints on carbon-to-oxygen ratios and even isotopic ratios. Many companions and isolated targets have also shown spectral variability. In this work we observed the super-Jupiter AB~Pictoris~b across four consecutive nights using VLT/CRIRES+ as part of the ESO SupJup survey, exploring how the constraints on chemical composition and temperature profile change over time using spectral line shape variations between nights. We performed atmospheric retrievals of the high-resolution observations and found broadly consistent results across all four nights, but there were differences for some parameters. We clearly detect H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO in each night, but abundances varied by $\sim2\sigma$, which was correlated to the deep atmosphere temperature profiles. We also found differences in the $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C ratios in each night by up to $\sim3\sigma$, which seemed to be correlated with the cloud deck pressure. Our combined retrieval simultaneously analysing all nights together constrained broadly the average of each night individually, with the C/O$=0.59\pm0.01$, consistent with solar composition, and $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C~$ = 102\pm8$, slightly higher than the ISM and Solar System values. We also find a low projected rotational velocity, suggesting that AB~Pictoris~b is either intrinsically a slow rotator due to its young age or that the spin axis is observed pole-on with a $\sim90^\circ$ misalignment with its orbit inclination. Future observations will be able to further explore the variability and orbit of AB~Pictoris~b as well as for other companions.","['Siddharth Gandhi', 'Sam de Regt', 'Ignas Snellen', 'Paulina Palma-Bifani', 'Idriss Abdoulwahab', 'Gaël Chauvin', 'Darío González Picos', 'Yapeng Zhang', 'Rico Landman', 'Tomas Stolker', 'Aurora Kesseli', 'Willeke Mulder', 'Antoine Chomez', 'Anne-Marie Lagrange', 'Alice Zurlo']",17.0,22.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05114,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: atmospheres – planets and satellites: gaseous planets – planets and satellites: composition – techniques: imaging spectroscopy 1 INTRODUCTION Directly-imaged companions at wide orbital separations rep- resent unique targets to characterise formation at the ex- tremes of orbital separation'],2025-01-10
On the conditioning of the solar corona due to large flaring,"Aims: We aim to better characterize the conditions of the solar corona and especially with respect to the occurrence of confined and eruptive flares. Therefore, we have modeled the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar cycle 24. Methods: Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data around each event, we employ nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to approximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source regions. Superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the time series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities is used to pin down the characteristics of the pre- and post-flare time evolution, as well as to assess flare-related changes. Results: (1) During the 24 hours leading to a major flare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux evolve closely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to confined flares the free energy evolves more similar with respect to the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying field, while it is the opposite prior to eruptive flares. (2) The flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\% of major flares when combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local stability. (3) The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels within $\approx$\,6 to 12~hours after eruptive major M-class flares while the impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. (4) Postflare replenishment times of $\gtrsim$12~hours after eruptive X-class flares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive X-class flares within a few hours.","['Julia K.

Detection of thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS) in TMC-1: sulfur-oxygen differentiation along the hydrogenation sequence,"In recent years the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium has experienced a renewed interest due to the detection of a large variety of molecules containing sulfur. Here we report the first identification in space of a new S-bearing molecule, thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS), which is the sulfur counterpart of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We detected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four most favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column density of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less abundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities of the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules increase their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less abundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be less favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources like TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented them into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of magnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde. Quantum chemical calculations carried out for one of the potential formation pathways, the S + C2H5 reaction, indicate that formation of CH3CHS is only a minor channel in this reaction.","['M.

A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope,"Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.","['Zhuowen Li', 'Xizhen Lu', 'Guoliang Lü', 'Chunhua Zhu', 'Helei Liu', 'Jinlong Yu']",4.0,12.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05139,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,,['stars: black holes-stars:evolution 1'],2025-01-10
High-resolution imaging of the radio source associated with Project Hephaistos Dyson Sphere Candidate G,"We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.","['Tongtian Ren', 'Michael A.

Detection of binary companions below the diffraction limit with lucky imaging,"We provide a technique for resolving intermediate-separation binaries stars with medium-sized telescopes (i.e. diameter less than or equal to 2.5 m) at wavelengths around 825 nm in the super-resolution range (i.e. below the limit defined by the Rayleigh criterion). We combined two well-known algorithms that have been applied to reduce the halo in lucky imaging observations: COvariancE of Lucky Images (COELI) and the Lucky Imaging Speckle Suppression Algorithm (LISSA). We reviewed the fundamentals of both algorithms and describe a new technique called Lucky Imaging Super resolution Technique (LIST), which is optimized for peak highlighting within the first ring of the Airy pattern. To validate the technique, we carried out several observing campaigns of well-known binary stars with FastCam on the 1.52 m TCS and 2.56 m NOT. The projected angular separation between objects was resolved by applying LIST with a result below 0.15"". It can go down to approximately 0.05"", given the limitations of the detector plate scale. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that binary companions with such small angular separations have been detected using only lucky imaging at optical wavelengths. The average accuracy achieved for the angular separation measurement is 16 mas with NOT and is 20 mas with TCS. The average accuracy obtained for the position angle measurement is $9.5^o$ for NOT and $11^o$ for TCS. We also made an attempt to measure the relative brightnesses of the binary components, obtaining results that are compatible with literature measurements. Lucky imaging, in combination with speckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of multiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes. However, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime are less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.","['Miguel A. Cagigas', 'R. Clavero', 'Manuel P.

Impact of photoevaporative winds in chemical models of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks,"Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.","['Luke Keyte', 'Thomas J.

Vertical Kinematics of the Young Galactic Clusters,"The young disc vertical phase is paramount in our understanding of Galaxy evolution. Analysing the vertical kinematics at different galactic regions provides important information about the space-time variations of the Galactic potential. The vertical phase snail-shell structure found after Gaia DR2 release encompasses a wide range of ages. %\citep{2018Natur.561..360A, Antoja23}. However, the structure of the $V_Z\, vs \, Z$ diagram appears linear when the analysis is limited to studying objects younger than 30 Ma. Based on the vertical velocity and height-over-disc maps obtained for a sample of young open clusters, this method also allows the matter density in the Solar neighbourhood to be estimated using a completely different approach than previously found in the literature. We use two different catalogues of star clusters to confirm the previous result and study new age ranges. The linear pattern between $V_Z$ and $Z$ shows different slopes, $\partial V_Z/\partial Z$, for various age groups. The results fit a simple model (harmonic oscillator) of in-plane decoupled vertical dynamics up to a certain age limit, corresponding to $\sim$ 30 Ma. This work also analyses the relationship between the local volumetric density of matter ($\rho_0$) and the disc vertical kinematics for different age ranges, all below 50 Ma. The best estimates of the effective volumetric mass density in the Solar neighbourhood, 0.09-0.15 M$_\odot$ pc${}^{-3}$, agree with those given by other authors, assessing the reliability of the proposed dynamical model.

Periods of outbursts and standstills and parameters variations in two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc,"We present our results on two Z Cam stars: Z Cam and AT Cnc. We apply observational data for the periods that cover the states of outbursts and standstills, which are typical for this type of objects. We report an appearance of periodic oscillations in brightness during the standstill in AT Cnc, with small amplitude variations of 0.03 - 0.04 mag and periodicity of $\approx 20-30$ min. Based on the estimated derredened color index (B - V )0, we calculate the color temperature for both states of the two objects. During the transition from the outbursts to the standstill's state Z Cam varies from bluer to redder, while AT Cnc stays redder in both states. We calculate some of the stars' parameters as: the radii of the primary and secondary components, and the orbital separation for both objects. We construct the profiles of the effective temperature in the discs of the two objects. Comparing the parameters of both systems, we see that Z Cam is definitely the hotter object and we conclude it has a more active accretion disk.","['Daniela Boneva', 'Krasimira Yankova', 'Denislav Rusev']",3.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05214,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,"Astronomy, MDPI, 2024, 3, 208-219",['binary stars'],2025-01-10
Bayesian correction of $H(z)$ cosmic chronometers data with systematic errors,"We show that the 32 $H(z)$ data from cosmic chronometers have overestimated uncertainties and make use of a Bayesian method to correct and reduce it. We then use the corrected data to constrain flat $\Lambda$CDM and O$\Lambda$CDM parameters.

Exploring the non-thermal physics behind the pulsar wind nebula PSR J2030+4415 through radio observations,"PSR J2030+4415 is a gamma-ray pulsar with an X-ray pulsar wind nebula elongated along the north-south direction. The system shows a prominent X-ray filament oriented at an angle of 130° to the nebula axis. To improve our understanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula, we attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study its morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament emission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR J2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with findings at other wavelengths. We obtained radio images at 736 and 1274 MHz that reveal a structure trailing the pulsar, with a morphology overlapping the X-ray nebula. This radio structure is the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula. The derived spectral index along this structure shows spatial variation. There are no hints of the pulsar and the filament at any of the explored radio frequencies, but we obtained restrictive upper limits. A physical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and consistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented. We propose that particle acceleration occurs in the nebula tail due to the presence of a re-collimation shock, and the highest energy particles gradually escape from it through energy-dependent diffusion. We also find a lower limit in the energy of the particles escaping along the X-ray filament of ~GeV.","['J.M. Paredes', 'P. Benaglia', 'V. Bosch-Ramon', 'A.Tej', 'A. Saha', 'J. Martí', 'P.

"Revealing the hidden cosmic feast: A z=4.3 galaxy group hosting two optically dark, efficiently star-forming galaxies","We present the confirmation of a compact galaxy group candidate, CGG-z4, at $z=4.3$ in the COSMOS field. This structure was identified by two spectroscopically confirmed $z=4.3$ $K_s$-dropout galaxies with ALMA $870\rm\, \mu m$ and 3 mm continuum detections, surrounded by an overdensity of NIR-detected galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts of $4.0<z<4.6$. The two ALMA sources, CGG-z4.a and CGG-z4.b, are detected with both CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines. [CI](1-0) is detected on CGG-z4.a, and H$_{2}$O($1_{1,0}-1_{0,1}$) absorption is detected on CGG-z4.b. We model an integrated spectral energy distribution by combining the FIR-to-radio photometry of this group and estimate a total star formation rate of $\rm\sim2000\, M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, making it one of the most star-forming groups known at $z>4$. Their high CO(5-4)/CO(4-3) ratios indicate that the inter-stellar mediums (ISMs) are close to thermalization, suggesting either high gas temperatures, densities, and/or pressure, while the low [CI](1-0)/CO(4-3) line ratios indicate high star formation efficiencies. With [CI]-derived gas masses we found the two galaxies have extremely short gas depletion times of $99$ Myr and $<63$ Myr respectively, suggesting the onset of quenching.

Vertical shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones: effects of the full Coriolis acceleration and thermal diffusion,"Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.","['Junho Park', 'Stéphane Mathis']",15.0,21.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05293,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics', 'Fluid Dynamics']",,,['Hydrodynamics – turbulence – stars: rotation – stars: evolution 1 INTRODUCTION The rotation of stars deeply modifies their evolution (e'],2025-01-10
The Role of Atmospheric Composition in Defining the Habitable Zone Limits and Supporting E. coli Growth,"Studying exoplanet atmospheres is essential for assessing their potential to host liquid water and their capacity to support life (their habitability). Each atmosphere uniquely influences the likelihood of surface liquid water, defining the habitable zone (HZ), the region around a star where liquid water can exist. However, being within the HZ does not guarantee habitability, as life requires more than just liquid water. In this study, we adopted a two-pronged approach. First, we estimated the surface conditions of planets near the HZ's inner edge under various atmospheric compositions. By utilizing a 3D climate model, we refined the inner boundaries of the HZ for planets with atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2 for the first time. Second, we investigated microbial survival in these environments, conducting laboratory experiments on the growth and survival of E. coli K-12, focusing on the impact of different gas compositions. This innovative combination of climate modeling and biological experiments bridges theoretical climate predictions with biological outcomes. Our findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.","['Asena Kuzucan', 'Emeline Bolmont', 'Guillaume Chaverot', 'Jaqueline Quirino Ferreira', 'Bastiaan Willem Ibelings', 'Siddharth Bhatnagar', 'Daniel Frank McGinnis']",6.0,21.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05297,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['exoplanets'],2025-01-10
Forecast of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae time delay measurement by Muztage-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope,"Strong lensing time delay measurement is a promising method to address the Hubble tension, offering a completely independent approach compared to both the cosmic microwave background analysis and the local distance ladder. As a third-party examination of the Hubble tension, this method provides a unique perspective. Strongly lensed quasar (glQSO) systems have demonstrated significant potential in tackling this issue, achieving an impressive \(2\%\) accuracy level. However, advancing to \(1\%\) or sub-percent accuracy is challenging due to several intrinsic limitations of glQSOs. Fortunately, strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) offer a more robust solution, thanks to their characteristic light curve, significant brightness variations, and additional advantages. The Muztagh-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope (MOST) is an exceptional instrument for monitoring strong lensing time delays. In this study, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia systems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey Space Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with \(300s \times 9\) exposures in each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images maintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for fitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a time delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below one hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance the precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward resolving the Hubble tension.","['Guanhua Rui', 'Wenwen Zheng', 'Zizhao He', 'Yiping Shu', 'Xinzhong Er', 'Guoliang Li', 'Bin Hu']",11.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05303,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-10
The CO-Fuelled Time Machine: Tracing Birth Conditions and Terrestrial Planet Formation Outcomes in HD 163296 through Pebble Drift-induced CO Enhancements,"The architecture and composition of planetary systems are thought to be strongly influenced by the transport and delivery of dust and volatiles via ices on pebbles during the planet formation phase in protoplanetary discs. Understanding these transport mechanisms is crucial in building a comprehensive picture of planet formation, including material and chemical budget; constraining the birth properties of these discs is a key step in this process. We present a novel method of retrieving such properties by studying the transport of icy pebbles in the context of an observed gas-phase CO enhancement within the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296. We combine Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to determine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare our results against observations and models in the literature; we find the birth-condition disc gas mass to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{disc}}/M_{\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the characteristic radius to be $\log_{10}(r_{\rm{c}}/\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$. We additionally determine that dust grains must be `fragile' ($v_{f}=100~\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$) to retain enough dust to match current dust mass observations, with our lowest fragmentation velocity model providing a current-age dust mass of $\rm{M_{dust}}=662^{+518}_{-278} \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ based on the retrieved birth conditions. Using our retrieved birth conditions, we extend our simulations to mass of material reaching the water snowline in the inner disc, where terrestrial and super-Earth planets may be forming, and speculate on the nature of these exoplanets.","['Joe Williams', 'Sebastiaan Krijt']",12.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05316,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['protoplanetary discs – planets and satellites: formation 1 INTRODUCTION Understanding the full process of planet formation is a challenging task', 'consideringthevastsizeandmassscalescoveredinastronom- icallyshorttimescalesofafewmillionyears']",2025-01-10
"Martian atmospheric disturbances from orbital images and surface pressure at Jezero Crater, Mars, during Martian Year 36","We present a study of atmospheric disturbances at Jezero Crater, Mars, using ground-based measurements of surface pressure by the Perseverance rover in combination with orbital images from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. The study starts at Ls $\sim$ 13.3° in MY36 (March 6th, 2021) and extends up to Ls $\sim$ 30.3° in MY37 (February 28th, 2023). We focus on the characterization of the major atmospheric phenomena at synoptic and planetary-scales. These are the thermal tides (measured up to the sixth component), long-period pressure oscillations (periods > 1 sol), the Aphelion Cloud Belt, and the occasional development of regional dust storms over Jezero. We present the seasonal evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the thermal tides and their relation with the atmospheric dust content (optical depth). Three regional dust storms and one polar storm extending over Jezero produced an increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes but resulted in inverse responses in their phases. We show that the primary regular wave activity is due to baroclinic disturbances with periods of 2-4 sols and amplitudes $\sim$ 1-15 Pa increasing with dust content, in good agreement with theoretical predictions by model calculations. The spacecraft images show a number of arc-shaped, spiral and irregular cyclonic vortices, traced by dust and clouds at the edge of the North Polar Cap, that could be behind some of the pressure oscillations measured at Jezero.","['A.

Resolving an Asteroseismic Catastrophe: Structural Diagnostics from p-mode Phase Functions off the Main Sequence,"On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation $\delta\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily interpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an interpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating $\delta\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this estimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red giants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We derive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when applied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative features of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants. This expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale primarily with their global seismic properties as $\delta\nu_{02} \propto \Delta\nu^2/\nu_\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their internal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the transition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently reported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission data. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the convective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a third of a wavelength at $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at which point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the boundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or $r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective boundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.","['J.

Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with $\texttt{FOREST}$,"We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the ""cloud-in-cloud"" effect. In the ""quantum-well"" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.","['Chiara Animali', 'Pierre Auclair', 'Baptiste Blachier', 'Vincent Vennin']",13.0,39.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05371,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-10
MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo at high Pm numbers,"To power gamma-ray bursts and other high-energy events, large-scale magnetic fields are required to extract rotational energy from compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key mechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field amplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which angular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime reveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and buoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these findings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo in stratified simulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\mathrm{Pm}$ regime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in the regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high $\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo coefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described by an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic field as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a shorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the off-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic field in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in global simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\sim 5$, which could lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in the high-Pm regime.","['Alexis Reboul-Salze', 'Loren E.

Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures,"The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS), offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrum of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation, while incorporating redshift binning. Notably, our analysis includes all Newtonian effects, leading relativistic projection effects, and general relativistic contributions, including radiation dynamics, up to second order in perturbation theory. For simplicity, however, we neglect any biasing effects. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectrum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z=0.6 \pm 0.05$, and compare our analytical results with simulations. For the contributions that already appear in a Newtonian treatment we find an interesting cancellation between the quadratic terms. At $z=2$, the projection effects and the dynamical effects have similar amplitude on large scales as we approach $k \sim \mathcal{H}$. In the squeezed limit, radiation effects are found to be the leading relativistic effects, by one order of magnitude. At $z=0.6$, we find the correct weak-field hierarchy between the terms, controlled by the ratio $\mathcal{H}/k$, but we still find that dynamical effects (from nonlinear evolution) are only a factor $2-3$ smaller than the projection effects. We compare our results with simulation measurements and find good agreement for the total bispectrum.","['Thomas Montandon', 'Enea Di Dio', 'Cornelius Rampf', 'Julian Adamek']",9.0,34.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05422,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-10

We generate 250,000 synthetic star-forming galaxies composed of up to 3000 HII regions and explore how variations in parameters affect their integrated emission-line properties. Our results highlight systematic biases in oxygen-abundance estimates derived using traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the composite nature of star-forming galaxies when interpreting integrated nebular emission.

A Disintegrating Rocky Planet with Prominent Comet-like Tails Around a Bright Star,"We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU.

Planet formation and long-term stability in a very eccentric stellar binary,"Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.","['Jakob Stegmann', 'Evgeni Grishin', 'Cole Johnston', 'Nora L.

Two light curve dips were observed; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant and the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals. Through a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included the dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization properties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes associated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%. The polarization angle showed a swing of ~70° across the dip and off-dip states, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE observation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized emission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the neutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended accretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization degrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.","['Alessandro Di Marco', 'Fabio La Monaca', 'Anna Bobrikova', 'Luigi Stella', 'Alessandro Papitto', 'Juri Poutanen', 'Maria Cristina Baglio', 'Matteo Bachetti', 'Vladislav Loktev', 'Maura Pilia', 'Daniele Rogantini']",16.0,16.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05511,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['accretion disks – polarization – stars: individual: GX 13+1 – stars: neutron – X-ray binaries 1', 'accretion']",2025-01-13
JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies,"The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z<0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.","['Sophie Lebowitz', 'Kevin Hainline', 'Stéphanie Juneau', 'Jianwei Lyu', 'Christina Williams', 'Stacey Alberts', 'Xiaohui Fan', 'Marcia Rieke']",18.0,35.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05512,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST,"Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z>3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.","['D.

"XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029","We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| < 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D ~ 0.21 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.",['XRISM Collaboration'],2.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05514,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-13
The 2D pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecular kinematics,"[Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new, unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools to study the disk pressure structure and estimate fundamental disk parameters, as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecular approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extract the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide range in the disk radial and vertical extents. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extend standard methodologies to fit multiple-component line profiles. We then sample the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtain dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$ and scale radius $ R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parametrization. Finally, we investigate the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecular approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.","['V.

A multi-frequency study of sub-parsec jets with the Event Horizon Telescope,"The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-Königl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.","['Jan Röder', 'Maciek Wielgus', 'Andrei P.

The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid,"Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions.

The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation,"State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.","['Beatriz Campos Estrada', 'David A.

Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis,"Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.","['Clelia Altomonte', 'Malcolm Fairbairn', 'Lucien Heurtier']",3.0,10.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05531,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-01-13
Space-based Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Ray Experiments,"Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon altitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the atmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers (EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for observing EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\sim 10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR} > ~\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence signal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the atmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades have sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim fluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally, the beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with $> ~\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic ray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy thresholds can be $> ~\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs). ...In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development from orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that have been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished by discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR spectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction.

Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system,"We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.","['George W. King', 'Lía R. Corrales', 'Vincent Bourrier', 'Leonardo A.

A New Approach for Constraining Large-Scale Temperature Fluctuations in the Intergalactic Medium,"The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim4$, marking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium reionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM between neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\sigma (\ln T) \sim \Delta T/T = 20-50\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for reionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective optical depths of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest towards a large number of background quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective optical depths in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature fluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured the distributions of effective Lyman-$\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$ X-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to $z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the simulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do not detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the simulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until the model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight constraints on $\sigma (\ln T) < 0.29 \ (<0.40)$ at $2 \sigma\ (3 \sigma)$ at $z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker constraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales. Our constraints are the tightest to date, and imply that either the IGM temperature contrast caused by helium reionization is less than $\sim30\%$, or that the process has not yet significantly started at $z=3.76$.","['Saba Etezad-Razavi', 'Sarah E.

"An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN REJ1034+396","We report the analysis of ~1Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396. The 0.3-9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically-blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence ($\Delta C\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity $v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous $0.5-2.5$\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log $N_\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) = $21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.","['Chloe Taylor', 'Daniel Wilkins', 'Steven Allen']",6.0,10.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05579,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-13
More than a void? The detection and characterization of cavities in a simulated galaxy's interstellar medium,"The interstellar medium of galaxies is filled with holes, bubbles, and shells, typically interpreted as remnants of stellar evolution. There is growing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and supernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and numerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases. Therefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities in particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the persistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points around each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the relationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that higher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities. By tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical properties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we detect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into supernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity based on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100 million years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work. Surprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be linked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are contracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million years. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the premise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study reveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters, larger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220 million years) compared to other cavities.","['Abolfazl Taghribi', 'Marco Canducci', 'Michele Mastropietro', 'Sven De Rijcke', 'Reynier Frans Peletier', 'Peter Tino', 'Kerstin Bunte']",6.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05581,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,,,,"['and shells withawiderangeofradiiandsizes(Westerlund&Mathewson1966', 'bubbles', 'galaxies: dwarf – supernovae: general – software: data analysis 1 INTRODUCTION It has been appreciated since the late 1960s that the interstellar medium of external galaxies is filled with holes']",2025-01-13
Mind the gaps: improved methods for the detection of periodicities in unevenly-sampled data,"The detection of periodic signals in irregularly-sampled time series is a problem commonly encountered in astronomy. Traditional tools used for periodic searches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties under irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic variability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the presence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine periodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves. Here we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period searches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these problems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer an appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known distribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood to be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical methods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional, (quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the data as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the method to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be described as a Gaussian process.

The LSPE-Strip Pointing Reconstruction and Star Tracker,"This paper aims to describe the Pointing Reconstruction Model (PRM) and the prototype Star Tracker, which will be mounted on LSPE-Strip, a microwave Q- and W-band CMB telescope planned for installation at the ""Observatorio del Teide"" in Tenerife. The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude provided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing direction and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various non-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration angles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the derivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the pointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles to validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the LSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations of the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky observations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker RMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain below 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of reconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating the Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's pointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2) observations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In the first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1 arcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration accuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.","['Michele Maris', 'Maurizio Tomasi', 'Matteo Baratto', 'Fabio Paonessa', 'Cristian Franceschet', 'Daniele Tavagnacco', 'Oscar Antonio Peverini', 'Fabrizio Villa', 'Mario Zannoni', 'Marco Bersanelli', 'Barbara Caccianiga', 'Stefano Mandelli', 'Aniello Mennella', 'Federico Nati', 'Stefano Sartor', 'Ricardo T.

Phase-resolved Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 Spectroscopy of Weakly-Irradiated Brown Dwarf GD 1400 and Energy Redistribution-Irradiation Trends in Six WD$-$BD Binaries,"Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete ""Dancing with Dwarfs"" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.","['Rachael C.

Stellar obliquities of eight close-in gas giant exoplanets,"The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows us to measure the projected stellar obliquity of exoplanets. From the spin-orbit alignment, planet formation and migration theories can be tested to improve our understanding of the currently observed exoplanetary population. Despite having the spin-orbit measurements for more than 200 planets, the stellar obliquity distribution is still not fully understood, warranting additional measurements to sample the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of eight gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and derive their projected stellar obliquity $\lambda$. We report a prograde, but misaligned orbit for HAT-P-50b ($\lambda =41^\circ\ ^{+10}_{-9}$), possibly hinting at previous high-eccentricity migration given the presence of a close stellar companion. We measured sky-projected obliquities that are consistent with aligned orbits for the rest of the planets: WASP-48b ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ \pm$ 4), WASP-59b ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ ^{+20}_{-21}$), WASP-140 Ab ($\lambda =-1^\circ\ \pm$ 3), WASP-173 Ab ($\lambda =9^\circ\ \pm$ 5), TOI-2046b ($\lambda =1^\circ\ \pm$ 6), HAT-P-41 Ab ($\lambda =-4^\circ\ ^{+5}_{-6}$), and Qatar-4b ($\lambda =-13^\circ\ ^{+15}_{-19}$). We measure the true stellar obliquity $\psi$ for four systems. We infer a prograde, but misaligned, orbit for TOI-2046b with $\psi=$42$^{+10}_{-8}$\,deg. Additionally, $\psi = 30^\circ\ ^{+18}_{-15}$ for WASP-140 Ab, $\psi = 21^\circ\ ^{+9}_{-10}$ for WASP-173 Ab, and $\psi = 32^\circ\ ^{+14}_{-13}$ for Qatar-4b. The aligned orbits are consistent with slow disk migration, ruling out violent events that would excite the orbits over the history of these systems. Finally, we provide a new age estimate for TOI-2046 of at least 700 Myr and for Qatar-4 of at least 350-500 Myr, contradicting previous results.","['J. Zak', 'H. M. J. Boffin', 'E. Sedaghati', 'A.

"OpenUniverse2024: A shared, simulated view of the sky for the next generation of cosmological surveys","The OpenUniverse2024 simulation suite is a cross-collaboration effort to produce matched simulated imaging for multiple surveys as they would observe a common simulated sky. Both the simulated data and associated tools used to produce it are intended to uniquely enable a wide range of studies to maximize the science potential of the next generation of cosmological surveys. We have produced simulated imaging for approximately 70 deg$^2$ of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep survey and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, as well as overlapping versions of the ELAIS-S1 Deep-Drilling Field for LSST and the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey for Roman. OpenUniverse2024 includes i) an early version of the updated extragalactic model called Diffsky, which substantially improves the realism of optical and infrared photometry of objects, compared to previous versions of these models; ii) updated transient models that extend through the wavelength range probed by Roman and Rubin; and iii) improved survey, telescope, and instrument realism based on up-to-date survey plans and known properties of the instruments. It is built on a new and updated suite of simulation tools that improves the ease of consistently simulating multiple observatories viewing the same sky. The approximately 400 TB of synthetic survey imaging and simulated universe catalogs are publicly available, and we preview some scientific uses of the simulations.","['OpenUniverse', 'LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration', 'Roman HLIS Project Infrastructure Team', 'Roman RAPID Project Infrastructure Team', 'Roman Supernova Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team', 'A.

The Emerging Class of Double-Faced White Dwarfs,"We report our findings on a spectroscopic survey of seven unresolved DA+DB binary white dwarf candidates. We have discovered extreme spectroscopic variations in one of these candidates, SDSS J084716.21+484220.40. Previous analysis failed to reproduce the optical spectrum using a single object with a homogeneous atmosphere. Our time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a double-faced white dwarf that switches between a DBA and DA spectral type over 6.5 or 8.9 hours due to varying surface abundances. We also provide time-series spectroscopy of the magnetic DBA, SDSS J085618.94+161103.6 (LB 8915), and confirm an inhomogeneous atmosphere. We employ an atmosphere model with hydrogen caps and a helium belt that yields excellent fits to our time-resolved spectra. We use the oblique rotator model to derive the system geometry for both targets. With the addition of these two objects, the emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs now consists of seven members. We summarize the properties of this new class of objects, and discuss how magnetism impacts the convective processes and leads to the formation of double-faced white dwarfs. We identify cooler versions of white dwarfs with inhomogeneous atmospheres among the cool magnetic DA white dwarf sample, where the H$\alpha$ line is shallower than expected based on pure hydrogen atmosphere models.","['Adam Moss', 'Mukremin Kilic', 'Pierre Bergeron', 'Gracyn Jewett', 'Warren Brown']",9.0,14.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05649,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cell-based Coadds and Metadetection Weak Lensing Shape Catalogue,"We present the Metadetection weak lensing galaxy shape catalogue from the six-year Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) imaging data. This dataset is the final release from DES, spanning 4422 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe how the catalogue was constructed, including the two new major processing steps, cell-based image coaddition and shear measurements with Metadetection. The DES Y6 Metadetection weak lensing shape catalogue consists of 151,922,791 galaxies detected over riz bands, with an effective number density of $n_{\rm eff}$ =8.22 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ and shape noise of $\sigma_e$ = 0.29. We carry out a suite of validation tests on the catalogue, including testing for PSF leakage, testing for the impact of PSF modeling errors, and testing the correlation of the shear measurements with galaxy, PSF, and survey properties. In addition to demonstrating that our catalogue is robust for weak lensing science, we use the DES Y6 image simulation suite (Mau, Becker et al. 2025) to estimate the overall multiplicative shear bias of our shear measurement pipeline. We find no detectable multiplicative bias at the roughly half-percent level, with m = (3.4 $\pm$ 6.1) x $10^{-3}$, at 3$\sigma$ uncertainty. This is the first time both cell-based coaddition and Metadetection algorithms are applied to observational data, paving the way to the Stage-IV weak lensing surveys.","['M. Yamamoto', 'M. R.

A new algorithm for detecting X-ray shots in Cyg X-1,"The short-term X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 can be interpreted as random occurrence of mini-flares known as the shots, whose physical nature is still unclear. We propose a new algorithm for shot identification in the X-ray light curve, based on baseline detection and template fitting. Compared with previous techniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and shorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after correction for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence rate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate has a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher mass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots. We also find that the abrupt hardening near the shot peak found in previous studies is attributed to different shot profiles in different energy bands; there is no need to involve a rapid physical process to suddenly harden the emitting spectrum.","['Jin Qin', 'Hua Feng', 'Lian Tao']",8.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05679,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,ApJ,,[],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog,"Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.","['D. Anbajagane', 'M. Tabbutt', 'J. Beas-Gonzalez', 'B. Yanny', 'S. Everett', 'M. R. Becker', 'M. Yamamoto', 'E. Legnani', 'J. De Vicente', 'K.

Optical frequency comb integration in radio telescopes: advancing signal generation and phase calibration,"Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.","['Minji Hyun', 'Changmin Ahn', 'Junyong Choi', 'Jihoon Baek', 'Woosong Jeong', 'Do-Heung Je', 'Do-Young Byun', 'Jan Wagner', 'Myoung-Sun Heo', 'Taehyun Jung', 'Jungwon Kim']",7.0,25.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05691,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Instrumentation and Detectors', 'Optics']",,,[],2025-01-13

Exoplanet Ephemerides Change Observations (ExoEcho). I. Transit Timing Analysis of Thirty-Seven Exoplanets using HST/WFC3 Data,"The ExoEcho project is designed to study the photodynamics of exoplanets by leveraging high-precision transit timing data from ground- and space-based telescopes. Some exoplanets are experiencing orbital decay, and transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful technique to study their orbital period variations. In this study, we have obtained transit middle-time data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for 37 short-period exoplanets, most of which are hot Jupiters. To search for potential long- and short-term orbital period variations within the sample, we conduct TTV model fitting using both linear and quadratic ephemeris models. Our analysis identifies two hot Jupiters experiencing strong periodic decays. Given the old age of the host stars of the hot Jupiter population, our findings call for a scenario where HJs are continuously being destructed and created. Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating high-precision transit timing data to TTV study in the future.","['Xinyue Ma', 'Wenqin Wang', 'Zixin Zhang', 'Cong Yu', 'Dichang Chen', 'Jiwei Xie', 'Shangfei Liu', 'Li Zhou', 'Bo Ma']",7.0,21.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05704,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Exoplanet systems — Transit photometry — Transit timing variation method 1'],2025-01-13
Expanding Molecular Shell and Possible {\gamma}-ray Source Associated with Supernova Remnant Kesteven 67,"We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.","['Yun-Zhi Shen', 'Yang Chen', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Tian-Yu Tu', 'Wen-Juan Zhong', 'Qian-Qian Zhang', 'Qian-Cheng Liu']",10.0,14.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05725,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['ISM:Individual objects: Kes 67(G18'],2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Photometric Data Set for Cosmology,"We describe the photometric data set assembled from the full six years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in support of static-sky cosmology analyses. DES Y6 Gold is a curated data set derived from DES Data Release 2 (DR2) that incorporates improved measurement, photometric calibration, object classification and value added information. Y6 Gold comprises nearly $5000~{\rm deg}^2$ of $grizY$ imaging in the south Galactic cap and includes 669 million objects with a depth of $i_{AB} \sim 23.4$ mag at S/N $\sim 10$ for extended objects and a top-of-the-atmosphere photometric uniformity $< 2~{\rm mmag}$. Y6 Gold augments DES DR2 with simultaneous fits to multi-epoch photometry for more robust galaxy shapes, colors, and photometric redshift estimates. Y6 Gold features improved morphological star-galaxy classification with efficiency $98.6\%$ and contamination $0.8\%$ for galaxies with $17.5 < i_{AB} < 22.5$. Additionally, it includes per-object quality information, and accompanying maps of the footprint coverage, masked regions, imaging depth, survey conditions, and astrophysical foregrounds that are used for cosmology analyses. After quality selections, benchmark samples contain 448 million galaxies and 120 million stars. This paper will be complemented by online data access and documentation.","['K. Bechtol', 'I.

$\Lambda$CDM model against redshift-binned data: A mock analysis based on SNIa and Cosmic Chronometers,"Despite the broad successes of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and its fitness to the various cosmological observations, it confronts challenges stemming from anomalies in the measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$).

This study pioneers a new investigation to probe this redshift dependency by generating mock data simulated from observational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and cosmic chronometers (CC), thereby increasing the data density in this field. By sorting the data into high-redshift and low-redshift bins, we aim to refine the cosmological constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model and determine whether the noted dependence on redshift is due to a lack of high-redshift observational data or if they signify intrinsic issues within the model itself. Our approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to minimize the $\chi^2$ function, thus tightening the cosmological constraints. Our findings within the mock analysis reveal discrepancies between the values of $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ derived from the mock data bins with high redshift and low redshift, indicating the potential deviation of the standard $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology from the high-redshift SNIa and CC data. If this deviation proposes a new physics beyond the standard model, then with better quality future data tracking the new physics, these discrepancies will be statistically significant.","['Saeed Pourojaghi', 'Mohammad Malekjani']",12.0,11.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05740,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,"['Dark energy', 'Cosmology', 'Cosmological parameters 1', 'standardΛCDM cosmology']",2025-01-13
Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-Spread Function Modeling,"We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C.

The elderly among the oldest: new evidence for extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars,"We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of three extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars, exploring uncharted territories at these low metallicities for this class of stars. Using high-resolution spectra acquired with HARPS-N at TNG, UVES at VLT, and PEPSI at LBT, and employing Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis calculations, we provide abundance measurements for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Sr. Our findings indicate that the stars have metallicities of [Fe/H] = -3.40 \pm 0.05, -3.28 \pm 0.02, and -2.77 \pm 0.05 for HD 331986, DO Hya, and BPS CS 30317-056, respectively. Additionally, we derived their kinematic and dynamical properties to gain insights into their origins. Interestingly, the kinematics of one star (HD 331986) is consistent with the Galactic disc, while the others exhibit Galactic halo kinematics, albeit with distinct chemical signatures. We compared the [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Mn] ratios of the current targets with recent literature estimates to determine whether these stars were either accreted or formed in situ, finding that the adopted chemical diagnostics are ineffective at low metallicities ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -$1.5). Finally, the established horizontal branch evolutionary models, indicating that these stars arrive at hotter temperatures on the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and then transition into RR Lyrae stars as they evolve, fully support the existence of such low-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. As a consequence, we can anticipate detecting more of them when larger samples of spectra become available from upcoming extensive observational campaigns.","[""Valentina D'Orazi"", 'Vittorio F.

Census of Ly$\alpha$ Emission from $\sim 600$ Galaxies at $z=5-14$: Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Luminosity Function and a Late Sharp Cosmic Reionization,"We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.","['Yuta Kageura', 'Masami Ouchi', 'Minami Nakane', 'Hiroya Umeda', 'Yuichi Harikane', 'Shintaro Yoshiura', 'Kimihiko Nakajima', 'Hidenobu Yajima', 'Tran Thi Thai']",18.0,45.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05834,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['Galaxy evolution (594)', 'Lyman-alpha galaxies (978)', 'Reion- ization (1383) 1', 'High-redshift galaxies (734)']",2025-01-13
Black hole-disc coevolution in the presence of magnetic fields: refining the Thorne limit with emission from within the plunging region,"The accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.",['Andrew Mummery'],5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05843,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,"['profoundly modify the properties of the black hole itself', 'provided a sufficiently large reservoir of material is available', 'accretion', 'accretion discs — black hole physics 1 INTRODUCTION The addition of material onto a black hole via an accretion flow will']",2025-01-13
Extreme exomoons in WASP-49 Ab: dynamics and detectability,"WASP-49Ab, a low-density, Saturn-like planet in a tight orbit around a Sun-like star within a wide binary system, is a compelling candidate for hosting a volcanic moon, as suggested by the detection of Doppler-shiftedthis http URLstudy evaluates the stability of potential satellites around WASP-49Ab under the influence of planetary oblateness, relativistic effects, and perturbations from a close companion star, focusing on their impact on light curve parameters such as transit duration and impact parameter variations, driven by the evolution of the planet's orbit in this extreme environment. Using N-body simulations and semi-analytical methods, we analysed moon's dynamics across varied initial conditions and gravitational frameworks including the potential of an oblate planet and the effects of the general relativity. We find that `selenity', a moon survival indicator, is high in close orbits with low eccentricity, near the Roche limit, especially for masses greater than Io's. Stability decreases as eccentricity or distance from the planet increases. Additionally, We observe a strong destabilising resonance near 1.4 planetary radii when planetary eccentricities are slightly greater than zero. This study confirms the potential for stable exomoons around WASP-49Ab despite its hostile environment, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse physical effects in stability analyses, aiding future detection efforts.","['Mario Sucerquia', 'Nicolás Cuello.']",2.0,7.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05866,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters,,['planets and satellites: detection – methods: numerical – planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability – stars: individual: WASP-49 1'],2025-01-13
BASSET: Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit -- Optimized Sub-Band Pulse Search Strategies for Faint Narrow-Band FRBs,"The existing single-pulse search algorithms for fast radio bursts (FRBs) do not adequately consider the frequency bandpass pattern of the pulse, rendering them incomplete for the relatively narrow-spectrum detection of pulses. We present a new search algorithm for narrow-band pulses to update the existing standard pipeline, Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit (BASSET). The BASSET employs a time-frequency correlation analysis to identify and remove the noise involved by the zero-detection frequency band, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pulses. The BASSET algorithm was implemented on the FAST real dataset of FRB 20190520B, resulting in the discovery of additional 79 pulses through reprocessing. The new detection doubles the number of pulses compared to the previously known 75 pulses, bringing the total number of pulses to 154. In conjunction with the pulse calibration and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulated injection experiments, this work updates the quantified parameter space of the detection rate. Moreover, a parallel-accelerated version of the BASSET code was provided and evaluated through simulation. BASSET has the capacity of enhancing the detection sensitivity and the SNR of the narrow-band pulses from the existing pipeline, offering high performance and flexible applicability. BASSET not only enhances the completeness of the low-energy narrow-band pulse detection in a more robust mode, but also has the potential to further elucidate the FRB luminosity function at a wider energy scale.","['J.-H.

Smuggling unnoticed: Towards a 2D view of water and dust delivery to the inner regions of protoplanetary discs,"Infrared spectroscopy, e.g., with JWST, provides a glimpse into the chemical inventory of the innermost region of protoplanetary discs, where terrestrial planets eventually form. The chemical make-up of regions inside snowlines is connected to the material drifting from the outer regions, which can be modeled with dust evolution models. However, infrared observations are limited by the high dust extinction in the inner disc, and only probes the abundances of gaseous species in the disc surface layers. As a result, the bulk mass of delivered volatiles is not directly relatable to what is measured through infrared spectra. In this paper, we investigate how the delivery of dust and ice after prolonged pebble drift affects the observable reservoir of water vapor in the inner disc. We develop a 1+1D approach based on dust evolution models to determine the delivery and distribution of vapor compared to the height of the $\tau = 1$ surface in the dust continuum. We find that the observable column density of water vapor at wavelengths probed by JWST spans many orders of magnitude over time, exhibiting different radial profiles depending on dust properties, drift rate, and local processing. In the presence of a traffic-jam effect inside the snowline, the observable vapor reservoir appears constant in time despite the ongoing delivery by pebble drift, such that water is effectively smuggled unnoticed. Differences in measured column densities then originate not only from variations in bulk vapor content, but also from differences in the properties and distribution of dust particles.","['Adrien Houge', 'Sebastiaan Krijt', 'Andrea Banzatti', 'Geoffrey A.

Characterisation of H$\beta$ spectra from EXO 051910+3737.7 X-rays binaries,"We investigate the spectral characteristics of the Be/X-ray binary system, EXO 051910+3737.7, in which Be/X-ray systems are the largest sub-class of high-mass X-ray binaries. Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai National Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES) instrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021. Our primary focus is directed towards the analysis of two Balmer lines, namely H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, given that Be stars typically exhibit emission features in at least one of these hydrogen Balmer lines during certain phases. Our observations reveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our monitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to characterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines indicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then analyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R variation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed rapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the precise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the duration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength differences ($\Delta\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters allowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\beta}$) of the H$\beta$ emitting envelope. The average value was calculated to be 2.585$r_*$, with a standard deviation of 0.050$r_*$.","['Pornisara Nuchvanichakul', 'Puji Irawati', 'Pakakaew Rittipruk', 'Poshak Gandhi', 'Christian Knigge', 'Phil Charles', 'Suwicha Wannawichian']",6.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05883,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],,"TRENDS IN SCIENCES, 2024; 21(9): 7653","['suchasaneutronstarorablackhole', 'High-mass X-ray binaries', 'Be stars', 'Spectral characteristics', 'Emission line Introduction High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are binary systems where a massive OB-star is held in orbit by acompactobject']",2025-01-13
Estimating variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series,"A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift.

Dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk,"Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets. Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is crucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so far the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of young planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8 micron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those obtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.","['Yao Liu', 'Dafa Li', 'Hongchi Wang', 'Haoran Feng', 'Min Fang', 'Fujun Du', 'Thomas Henning', 'Giulia Perotti']",5.0,12.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05913,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-13

Comparing radial migration in dark matter and MOND regimes,"Multiple studies on radial migration in disc galaxies have proven the importance of the effect of resonances with non-axisymmetric components on the evolution of galactic discs. However, the dynamical effects of classic Newtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM) differ from MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and might trigger different radial migration. A thorough analysis of radial migration considering these two gravitational regimes might shed some light on different predictions of DM and MOND theories. We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the effects of resonances and stellar radial migration (churning) in a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy in the DM and MOND regimes. We performed simulations of a MW-like galaxy to analyse the effect of non-axisymmetric structures (galactic bar and spiral arms) considering various parameters of the spiral structure. We conducted a two-dimensional numerical simulation consisting of the integration of $2 \cdot 10^6$ stars in a static rotating galactic potential for $6~\mbox{Gyr}$. We analysed the change in the star's position, the guiding radius, as well as the frequency phase space. We investigated DM and MOND approaches. The outcome of the simulation shows that the radial migration is much more pronounced in the MOND regime compared to the DM one. Compared to the DM approach, in the MOND regime, we observe up to five times as many stars with a maximum change in the guiding radius of more than $1.5~\mbox{kpc}$ during the time interval from $2-6~\mbox{Gyr}$.Analysis of the frequency phase space reveals that the most prominent resonances in all DM and MOND configurations are the co-rotation resonance with the spiral arms ($m=p=1$), outer Lindblad resonance with the galactic bar and spiral arms, and the co-rotation resonance ($m=2$, $p=1$) with the superposition of the galactic bar and spiral arms, $2 \Omega = \Omega_b + \Omega_{sp}$.","['R.

Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS 1809-193: Gamma-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?,"Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809-193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3-1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809-193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The {\gamma}-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809-193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3-1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809-193 and J1810.31925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809-193.","['Jiaxu Sun', 'Yang Chen', 'Yiwei Bao', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Xin Zhou']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05944,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['Pulsar wind nebulae', 'Gamma-ray sources', 'Supernova remnants', 'Cosmic rays 1']",2025-01-13
The CIELO Project: The Chemo-dynamical properties of gaLaxies and the cosmic web,"The CIELO project introduces a novel set of chemo-dynamical zoom-in simulations designed to simultaneously resolve galaxies and their nearby environments.

Fast Multi-tone Phase Calibration Signal Extraction,"This paper discusses a fast algorithm for analyzing the phases of a multi-tone phase calibration signal. The multi-tone method is superior to its single-tone counterpart. The PCal signal is a wide-band frequency comb derived from an ultra-stable frequency standard which is then coupled into the input stage of the radio astronomy receiver chain. The frequency comb allows to determine the signal delay, frequency response and phase shifts induced by the radio telescope instrumentation. The instrumentation delay is one of the several delay components that have to be compensated for in multi-telescope aperture synthesis. The frequency response also helps to monitor the instrumentation. To extract the information from the digitized baseband output of the receiver chain calls for fast numerical methods. A simple fast algorithm is presented in this paper. Two implementations are provided. One is based on precomputed look-up tables. The other is based on fast digital sinewave generators. Both lend themselves to parallel software processing on multi-core and SIMD-capable platforms as well as processing with FPGA gateware.

SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons,"The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available atthis https URL.","['Nikolas Frediani', 'Michael Krämer', 'Philipp Mertsch', 'Kathrin Nippel']",13.0,25.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06011,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Computational Physics']",,,[],2025-01-13
Timing and spectral studies of the Be/X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 using Insight-HXMT observations,"We report the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the high mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 during the 2021 type-II outburst based on the Insight-HXMT observations. Pulsations can be detected in the energy band of 1-150 keV. The pulse profile shows energy and luminosity dependence and variability. We observed transitions in the pulse profile shape during the rising and the decaying phase of the outburst. The pulse fraction exhibits an anti-correlation with luminosity and a non-monotonic energy dependence, with a possible dip near 30 keV during the outburst peak. The hardness-intensity diagrams (7-10 keV/4-7 keV) suggest state transitions during the early and late phases of the outburst. These transitions are consistent with the luminosity at which the pulse profile shape changes occur, revealing the source reaching the critical luminosity and transitioning between super-critical and sub-critical accretion regimes. We performed the average and phase-resolved spectral analysis, where the flux-resolved average spectra show a stable spectral evolution with luminosity. The phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the dependence of spectral parameters on the pulse phase varies with different luminosities.","['Yu-Jia Du', 'Lorenzo Ducci', 'Long Ji', 'Qing-Cui Bu', 'Ling-Da Kong', 'Peng-Ju Wang', 'Youli Tuo', 'Andrea Santangelo']",10.0,11.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06013,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['X-rays:binaries – pulsars: individual: EXO 2030 +375 1'],2025-01-13
Thermal emission from bow shocks III: Variable diffuse X-ray emission from stellar-wind bow shocks driven by dynamical instabilities,"X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and lightcurves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.","['Jonathan Mackey', 'Arun Mathew', 'Ahmad A.

Modern Bayesian Sampling Methods for Cosmological Inference: A Comparative Study,"We present a comprehensive comparison of different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, evaluating their performance on both standard test problems and cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis includes traditional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), slice sampling, nested sampling as implemented in dynesty, and PolyChord. We examine samplers through multiple metrics including runtime, memory usage, effective sample size, and parameter accuracy, testing their scaling with dimension and response to different probability distributions. While all samplers perform well with simple Gaussian distributions, we find that HMC and nested sampling show advantages for more complex distributions typical of cosmological problems. Traditional MCMC and slice sampling become less efficient in higher dimensions, while nested methods maintain accuracy but at higher computational cost. In cosmological applications using BAO data, we observe similar patterns, with particular challenges arising from parameter degeneracies and poorly constrained parameters.",['Denitsa Staicova'],5.0,20.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06022,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-01-13
Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters,"This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of ""escaper"" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.","['Grzegorz Wiktorowicz', 'Mirek Giersz', 'Abbas Askar', 'Arkadiusz Hypki', 'Lucas Helstrom']",3.0,13.0,8.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06037,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['stellar dynamics – methods: numerical – globular clusters: evolution – X-ray: binaries 1'],2025-01-13
ZF-UDS-7329: a Relic Galaxy in the Early Universe,"The formation time-scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways, by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, both methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering $\alpha$-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations that prevent us from accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analyse the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z$\sim$3.2 and show that we can achieve the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time-scales using stellar population synthesis by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare it to the well known relic galaxy NGC 1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.","['Eduardo A.

Periodic Variability of the Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae Surveyed through the Zwicky Transient Facility,"A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.","['Pinjian Chen', 'Xuan Fang', 'Xiaodian Chen', 'Jifeng Liu']",16.0,27.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06056,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],ApJ,,['Planetary nebulae (1249) — Planetary nebulae nuclei (1250) — Binary stars (154) — Close binary stars (254) — Stellar evolution (1599) 1'],2025-01-13
The ultraviolet luminosity function of star-forming galaxies between redshifts of 0.4 and 0.6,"We combine ultraviolet imaging of the 13H survey field, taken with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor telescope (XMM-OM) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) in the UVM2 band, to measure rest-frame ultraviolet 1500A luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.6. In total the UVM2 imaging covers a sky area of 641 square arcmin, and we detect 273 galaxies in the UVM2 image with 0.4<z<0.6. The luminosity function is fit by a Schechter function with best-fit values for the faint end slope alpha = -1.8 +0.4 -0.3 and characteristic absolute magnitude M* = -19.1 +0.3 -0.4. In common with XMM-OM based studies at higher redshifts, our best-fitting value for M* is fainter than previous measurements. We argue that the purging of active galactic nuclei from the sample, facilitated by the co-spatial X-ray survey carried out with XMM-Newton is important for the determination of M*. At the brightest absolute magnitudes (M1500<-18.5) the average UV colour of our galaxies is consistent with that of minimal-extinction local analogues, but the average UV colour is redder for galaxies at fainter absolute magnitudes, suggesting that higher levels of dust attenuation enter the sample at absolute magnitudes somewhat fainter than M*.","['M.

Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity,"We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.",['Matthew R.

SkyReconNet: A Deep Learning Inpainting Approach for Enhanced CMB Map Reconstruction,"We introduce a novel neural network architecture, SkyReconNet, which is tailored to reconstruct missing information in the masked regions of the full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting the CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. Our network addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of the dilated convolutional layers, with their expanded receptive fields and standard convolutional layers, to capture both the global and local features in a CMB map. This hybrid design enables our network to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions by effectively leveraging the information from the surrounding unmasked areas. The network is trained on simulated CMB maps generated using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) package. The galactic region of these simulated maps are excluded using the Planck 2018 common mask provided by the Planck CMB mission. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the full-sky CMB map, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool in CMB and other cosmological analyses.","['Reyhan D.

The GALAH survey: Improving chemical abundances using star clusters,"Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the fourth data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refitted spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, respectively, and publish a detrended catalogue. While we couldn't pinpoint the trends' origins, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the extent of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.","['Janez Kos', 'Sven Buder', 'Kevin L.

Understanding what helium absorption tells us about atmospheric escape from exoplanets,"Atmospheric escape is now considered the major contributing factor in shaping the demographic of detected exoplanets. However, inferences about the exoplanet populations strongly depend on the accuracy of the models. Direct observational tests of atmospheric models are still in their infancy. Helium escape from planetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe, already observed in $\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the basic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to predict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the atmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by implementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow. Importantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the triplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption is dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a measure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for planets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in the atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations by recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest that excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width, which is positively correlated with the mass loss rate. We also show that the helium absorption scales with incident radiation, particularly with the XEUV to FUV flux ratios.","['Giulia Ballabio', 'James E.

Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry,"The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.","['Rachel E.

Using a minimally parametrised SHAM to constrain the link between dark matter and galaxies,"Models of the galaxy-halo connection are needed to understand both galaxy clusters and large scale structure. To make said models, we need a robust method that assigns galaxies to halos and matches the observed and simulated stellar-halo mass relation. We employ an empirical Subhalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) model implemented in the halos module of SkyPy which assigns blue and red galaxies based on the Peng et al. (2010) (arXiv:1003.4747v2) model containing three parameters: $M_\mu$ (halo mass where half the galaxies assigned should be quenched), $\sigma$ (transition width from star forming to quenched) and $b$ (baseline quenched fraction at low mass). We test two sets of galaxy stellar mass functions for four populations of galaxies (central/satellite, blue/red) and run parameter estimation using Approximate Bayesian Computation over each model when compared to a set of applicable literature models. For the Weigel et al. (2016) (arXiv:1604.00008v1) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.94^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma = 0.49^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.31^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. For the Birrer et al. (2014) (arXiv:1401.3162v2) galaxies we find best fit values of log $M_\mu = 11.93^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, $\sigma = 0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ and $b = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Overall, we demonstrate that these constraints produce a model that is consistent with literature models for the central galaxies.

QPEs as Lense-Thirring precession of super-Eddington flows,"Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.","['M. Middleton', 'A. Gurpide', 'T. M. Kwan', 'L. Dai', 'R. Arcodia', 'J.

The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity${-}$Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus${-}$Auriga YSOs,"We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.","['Ramisa Akther Rahman', 'Joshua Bennett Lovell', 'Eric W.

"A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud","We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 x 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2-1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density ({\Sigma}dust) from far-IR emission, the H I column density (N(HI)) from the 21cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V )) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with {\Sigma}dust and I(CO), and less so with N(HI) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 Å bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ~200 lines of sight that are 2175 Å bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction-distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.","['Petia Yanchulova Merica-Jones', 'Karl Gordon', 'Karin Sandstrom', 'Claire E.

LensNet: Enhancing Real-time Microlensing Event Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks in the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network,"Traditional microlensing event vetting methods require highly trained human experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.","['Javier Viaña', 'Kyu-Ha Hwang', 'Zoë de Beurs', 'Jennifer C.

VIRAC2: NIR Astrometry and Time Series Photometry for 500M+ Stars from the VVV and VVVX Surveys,"We present VIRAC2, a catalogue of positions, proper motions, parallaxes and $Z$, $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ near-infrared photometric time series of 545 346 537 unique stars. The catalogue is based on a point spread function fitting reduction of nearly a decade of VISTA VVV and VVVX images, which cover $560~{\rm deg}^2$ of the Southern Galactic plane and bulge. The catalogue is complete at the $>90$ per cent level for $11<K_s~{\rm mag}<16$ sources, but extends to $K_s\approx{}17.5$ mag in most fields. Astrometric performance for $11<K_s~{\rm mag}<14$ sources is typically $\approx{}0.37~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ per dimension for proper motion, and $1~{\rm mas}$ for parallax. At $K_s=16$ the equivalent values are around $1.5~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ and $5~{\rm mas}$. These uncertainties are validated against Gaia DR3 and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. The complete catalogues are available via the ESO archive. We perform an initial search of the catalogue for nearby ultracool dwarf candidates. In total we find 26 new sources whose parallaxes place them within 50 parsecs of the Sun. Among them we find two high-confidence T dwarfs and a number of other sources that appear to lie close to the L/T transition.","['Leigh C. Smith', 'Philip W. Lucas', 'Sergey E.

Goku: A 10-Parameter Simulation Suite for Cosmological Emulation,"We present Goku, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the corresponding 10-dimensional emulator, GokuEmu, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. The simulations span the base parameters of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and its extensions, including dynamical dark energy ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Designed within the MF-Box framework, which integrates multi-scale and multi-fidelity simulations, the suite includes high-fidelity simulations evolving $3000^3$ particles in $1\,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$ volumes and low-fidelity simulations with $750^3$ particles across varying box sizes. This approach achieves percent-level accuracy in high-likelihood regions and 5% accuracy across broader parameter ranges, while reducing computational costs by over 90% compared to single-fidelity methods.The simulations adopt an accurate treatment of massive neutrinos, enhancing predictions of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales. Key innovations include an adaptive sampling strategy and the use of beam search to optimize generalization accuracy. The emulator is valid for redshifts $z \leq 3$ and scales $0.01 \lesssim k / (h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}) \lesssim 10$. Beyond the matter power spectrum, the simulations also support analyses of other statistical measures, such as the halo mass function. The emulator and its training data are publicly available atthis https URL, providing a valuable resource for cosmological parameter inference and model testing.","['Yanhui Yang', 'Simeon Bird', 'Ming-Feng Ho']",20.0,29.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06296,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-01-14
Improved SED-Fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-Out Quenching at $z\sim0.5$ and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at $z\sim1$,"Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star-formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multi-band flux profiles measured from Hubble images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4<z<1.5$ of stellar masses $10^{10}-10^{11.5}\ M_{\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. This results in SFR and $A_V$ profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and $A_V$ profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at $z\sim1.3$ are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.9$, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 - 0.08~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at $z\sim0.9$ and quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. The former are shallower at all masses by $\sim0.1~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at $z\sim1$ quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ quench from the inside-out.","['Alexander de la Vega', 'Susan A.

Constraints on Primordial Magnetic Fields from the Lyman-{\alpha} forest,"We present the first constraints on primordial magnetic fields from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest using full cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. At the scales and redshifts probed by the data, the flux power spectrum is extremely sensitive to the extra power induced by primordial magnetic fields in the linear matter power spectrum, at a scale that we parametrize with $k_{\rm peak}$. We rely on a set of more than a quarter million flux models obtained by varying thermal, reionization histories and cosmological parameters. We find a hint of extra power that is well fitted by the PMF model with $B\sim 0.2$ nG, corresponding to $k_{\rm peak}\sim 20$ Mpc$^{-1}$. However, when applying very conservative assumptions on the modelling of the noise, we obtain a 3$\sigma$ C.L. lower limit $k_{\rm peak}> 30$ Mpc$^{-1}$ which translates into the tightest bounds on the strength of primordial intergalactic magnetic fields: $B < 0.30$ nG (for fixed, nearly scale-invariant $n_{\rm B}=-2.9$).","['Mak Pavičević', 'Vid Iršič', 'Matteo Viel', 'James Bolton', 'Martin G.

"Deep radio interferometric search for decametre radio emission from the exoplanet Tau Bo\""otis b","Detection of electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission from exoplanets in the 10-40 MHz radio band is likely the only way to measure an exoplanet's magnetic field directly. However, no definitive detection of exoplanetary ECM emission has been made to date. A detection of the hot Jupiter Tau Boötis b was reported but with an observing mode that is not immune to confusion from off-axis interference, making the detection tentative. We searched for radio emissions from Tau Boötis b using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in interferometric mode, which employs direction-of-arrival information to discriminate genuine signals from interference. Our aim was to confirm the previous tentative detection or establish an upper limit in the case of a non-detection. We conducted observations using LOFAR's Low Band Antenna in interferometric mode, which totalled 64, hours spread over 8, nights. We created a custom data-processing pipeline to mitigate common challenges in decametric radio astronomy, including radio frequency interference, ionospheric distortions, and sidelobe noise from nearby bright radio sources. We used this pipeline to image the field around Tau Boötis b, searching for both quiescent and bursting emission from the direction of Tau Boötis b. Despite the high sensitivity of the interferometric observations and extensive data processing, no significant emission was detected from Tau Boötis b in Stokes V. We establish an upper limit of 2 sigma at 24 mJy for any continuous emission from the exoplanet. The previous tentative detection of 400 mJy is thus not confirmed by the interferometric observations. The previous tentative detection is unlikely to be a bona fide astrophysical signal. Our upper limit is lower than the flux density predicted by scaling laws, meaning either the scaling laws need to be revised or the emission from this particular system is beamed away from Earth.","['C.M.

WISDOM Project -- XXII. A 5% precision CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 383,"We present a measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of the nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 383, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with an angular resolution of $0.''050\times0.''024$ ($\approx16\times8$ pc$^2$). These observations spatially resolve the nuclear molecular gas disc down to $\approx41,300$ Schwarzschild radii and the SMBH sphere of influence by a factor of $\approx24$ radially, better than any other SMBH mass measurement using molecular gas to date. The high resolution enables us to probe material with a maximum circular velocity of $\approx1040$ km/s, even higher than those of the highest-resolution SMBH mass measurements using megamasers. We detect a clear Keplerian increase (from the outside in) of the line-of-sight rotation velocities, a slight offset between the gas disc kinematic (i.e. the position of the SMBH) and morphological (i.e. the centre of the molecular gas emission) centres, an asymmetry of the innermost rotation velocity peaks and evidence for a mild position angle warp and/or non-circular motions within the central $\approx0.''3$. By forward modelling the mass distribution and ALMA data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(3.58\pm0.19)\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), more precise ($5\%$) but consistent within $\approx1.4\sigma$ with the previous measurement using lower-resolution molecular gas data. Our measurement emphasises the importance of high spatial resolution observations for precise SMBH mass determinations.","['Hengyue Zhang', 'Martin Bureau', 'Ilaria Ruffa', 'Michele Cappellari', 'Timothy A.

Continuum Reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks Only With Sufficient X-ray Luminosity and Low Albedo,"Disk continuum reverberation mapping is one of the primary ways we learn about active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Reverberation mapping assumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive variability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags between X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent reverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as weakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and evidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how X-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform 3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray reprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated opacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation. We find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray irradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the reprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed, although linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray reprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock lags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing. Finally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by a factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the discrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.","['Amy Secunda', 'Yan-Fei Jiang', 'Jenny E.

VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts,"The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG).

Morphological Classification of Galaxies Through Structural and Star Formation Parameters Using Machine Learning,"We employ the XGBoost machine learning (ML) method for the morphological classification of galaxies into two (early-type, late-type) and five (E, S0--S0a, Sa--Sb, Sbc--Scd, Sd--Irr) classes, using a combination of non-parametric ($C,\,A,\,S,\,A_S,\,\mathrm{Gini},\,M_{20},\,c_{5090}$), parametric (Sérsic index, $n$), geometric (axial ratio, $BA$), global colour ($g-i,\,u-r,\,u-i$), colour gradient ($\Delta (g - i)$), and asymmetry gradient ($\Delta A_{9050}$) information, all estimated for a local galaxy sample ($z<0.15$) compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. We train the XGBoost model and evaluate its performance through multiple standard metrics. Our findings reveal better performance when utilizing all fourteen parameters, achieving accuracies of 88\% and 65\% for the two-class and five-class classification tasks, respectively. In addition, we investigate a hierarchical classification approach for the five-class scenario, combining three XGBoost classifiers. We observe comparable performance to the ``direct'' five-class classification, with discrepancies of only up to 3\%. Using SHAP (an advanced interpretation tool), we analyse how galaxy parameters impact the model's classifications, providing valuable insights into the influence of these features on classification outcomes.

The TESS-Keck Survey XXIV: Outer Giants may be More Prevalent in the Presence of Inner Small Planets,"We present the results of the Distant Giants Survey, a three-year radial velocity (RV) campaign to search for wide-separation giant planets orbiting Sun-like stars known to host an inner transiting planet. We defined a distant giant to have $a$ = 1--10 AU and $M_{p} \sin i = 70-4000$ \mearth~ = 0.2-12.5 \mj, and required transiting planets to have $a<1$ AU and $R_{p} = 1-4$ \rearth. We assembled our sample of 47 stars using a single selection function, and observed each star at monthly intervals to obtain $\approx$30 RV observations per target. The final catalog includes a total of twelve distant companions: four giant planets detected during our survey, two previously known giant planets, and six objects of uncertain disposition identified through RV/astrometric accelerations. Statistically, half of the uncertain objects are planets and the remainder are stars/brown dwarfs. We calculated target-by-target completeness maps to account for missed planets. We found evidence for a moderate enhancement of distant giants (DG) in the presence of close-in small planets (CS), P(DG|CS) = $30^{+14}_{-12}\%$, over the field rate of P(DG) = $16^{+2}_{-2}\%$. No enhancement is disfavored ($p \sim$ 8%). In contrast to a previous study, we found no evidence that stellar metallicity enhances P(DG|CS). We found evidence that distant giant companions are preferentially found in systems with multiple transiting planets and have lower eccentricities than randomly selected giant planets. This points toward dynamically cool formation pathways for the giants that do not disturb the inner systems.","['Judah Van Zandt', 'Erik A. Petigura', 'Jack Lubin', 'Lauren M. Weiss', 'Emma V.

From Stability to Instability: Characterizing the Eccentricities of Multi-planet Systems in the California Kepler Survey as a Means of Studying Stability,"Understanding the stability of exoplanet systems is crucial for constraining planetary formation and evolution theories. We use the machine-learning stability indicator, SPOCK, to characterize the stability of 126 high-multiplicity systems from the California Kepler Survey (CKS). We constrain the range of stable eccentricities for each system, adopting the value associated with a 50% chance of stability as the characteristic eccentricity. We confirm characteristic eccentricities via a small suite of N-body integrations. In studying correlations between characteristic eccentricity and various planet-pair and system-level metrics we find that minimum period ratio correlates most strongly with characteristic eccentricity. These characteristic eccentricities are approximately 20% of the eccentricities necessary for two-body mean-motion resonance overlap, suggesting three-body dynamics are needed to drive future instabilities. Systems in which the eccentricities would need to be high (> 0.15) to drive instability are likely dynamically relaxed and might be the fossils of a previous epoch of giant impacts that increased the typical planet-planet spacing.","['Matthew J.

Open-source Flux Transport (OFT). I. HipFT -- High-performance Flux Transport,"Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (this http URL). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.","['Ronald M.

A Predicted Great Dimming of T Tauri: Has it Begun?,"The optical star in the T Tauri triple system is the prototype of young sun-like stars in our galaxy. This complex and dynamic system has evidence for misaligned disks and outflows, and molecular material in a circumbinary ring that obscures the southern infrared binary, T Tau South. Observations by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) show that T Tau North, the optical star, has dimmed by up to ~2 magnitudes in the visual over the course of the past decade. The dimming across the B, V, R and I bands has a color character typical of changes in ISM extinction, suggesting an increase in obscuration along the line of sight to T Tau North. Material associated with the circumbinary ring around T Tau South has been predicted to occult the optical star via wide-scale orbital motion of the system. Through analysis of the geometrical configuration and motion of dust structures in the system, it seems that a great dimming of T Tau North by line-of-sight material associated with the T Tau South binary has, in fact, begun. Based on the extent and motion of the circumbinary ring material associated with the southern binary, T Tau North will likely experience dimming events for decades to come and may disappear entirely from the optical sky as the densest mid-plane region of the ring traverses our line of sight.",['Tracy L.

The heating efficiency of hot Jupiters from a data-driven perspective,"The inflated radii of hot Jupiters have been explored by various theoretical mechanisms. By connecting planetary thermal evolution models with the observed properties of hot Jupiters using hierarchical Bayesian models, a theoretical parameter called the heating efficiency has been introduced to describe the heating of the interiors of these planets. Previous studies have shown that the marginal distribution of this heating efficiency parameter has a single-peak distribution along the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq). Since the foundation of these Bayesian inference models are the observed properties of hot Jupiters, there must be a corresponding feature in the observed data that leads to the inferred single-peak distribution of the heating efficiency. This study aims to find the underlying cause of the single-peak heating efficiency distribution without relying on specific theoretical models. By analyzing the relationship between different observed physical properties, we obtained a similar single-peak distribution of the radius expansion efficiency of hot Jupiters along Teq, which can be explained by the correlation with the stellar effective temperature. However, a detailed investigation suggests that this single-peak distribution is actually the result of straightforward physical processes. Specifically, the increase in heating efficiency can be attributed to the increase in incident stellar flux, while the decrease in heating efficiency can be attributed to the rise in gravitational binding energy associated with the increase in planetary mass.","['Sheng Jin', 'Dong-Hong Wu', 'Yi-Xuan Cao', 'Zi-Yi Guo']",7.0,15.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06395,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Planet-star interactions – Planets and satellites: gaseous planets – Methods: data analysis – Methods: statistical 1'],2025-01-14
Multi-episodes of remote brightenings driven by a coronal EUV jet on the Sun,"Remote brightening (RB) is compact brightening at footpoints of magnetic loops, which are remotely-connecting to and confining an eruption in the solar atmosphere. Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet with a speed of about 90\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The loops connecting the RB and the jet have an apparent length of about 59\,Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least two episodes of brightenings, as characterised by two peaks in its lightcurve. The energies, which sustain the first and second peaks of the RB, are $6.3\times10^{26}$\,erg and $8.4\times10^{26}$\,erg, respectively, and take a significant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB brightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 seconds, while the second peak lags behind by 108 seconds. Besides the flows of the ejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption site. One is relatively cool with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=5.8-6.1$ and has a speed of about $275\pm15$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The other is hot with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=7.0-7.3$ and travels much faster with a speed of about 750$\pm$\,70\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We attribute the second peak of RB directly to this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a slow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of RB and the eruption, we infer this first episode is due to heating by nonthermal electrons. Our research demonstrates that the dynamics in an RB can offer vital insights into the nature of the corresponding eruption and help understand how the energy is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere.","['Chao Zhang', 'Zhenghua Huang', 'Hengyuan Wei', 'Youqian Qi', 'Mijie Shi', 'Hui Fu', 'Xiuhui Zuo', 'Weixin Liu', 'Mingzhe Sun', 'Ming Xiong', 'Lidong Xia']",4.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06403,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Plasma jets (1263)'],2025-01-14
Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in \textsc{Hi}-Rich Galaxies,"We analyze rotation curves of five \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.","['Demao Kong', 'Hai-Bo Yu']",5.0,8.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06413,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],Physics of the Dark Universe,,[': Galaxies Dark matter Galaxy dark matter halosABSTRACT WeanalyzerotationcurvesoffiveH I-richgalaxiesrecentlydiscoveredwithMeerKAT'],2025-01-14
Optimization of x-ray event screening using ground and in-orbit data for the Resolve instrument onboard the XRISM satellite,"The XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) satellite was successfully launched and put into a low-Earth orbit on September 6, 2023 (UT). The Resolve instrument onboard XRISM hosts an x-ray microcalorimeter detector, which was designed to achieve a high-resolution ($\leq$7 eV FWHM at 6 keV), high-throughput, and non-dispersive spectroscopy over a wide energy range. It also excels in a low background with a requirement of $< 2 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ (0.3--12.0 keV), which is equivalent to only one background event per spectral bin per 100 ks exposure. Event screening to discriminate x-ray events from background is a key to meeting the requirement. We present the result of the Resolve event screening using data sets recorded on the ground and in orbit based on the heritage of the preceding x-ray microcalorimeter missions, in particular, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard ASTRO-H. We optimize and evaluate 19 screening items of three types based on (1) the event pulse shape, (2) relative arrival times among multiple events, and (3) good time intervals. We show that the initial screening, which is applied for science data products in the performance verification phase, reduces the background rate to $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ meeting the requirement. We further evaluate the additional screening utilizing the correlation among some pulse shape properties of x-ray events and show that it further reduces the background rate particularly in the $<$2 keV band. Over 0.3--12 keV, the background rate becomes $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$.","['Yuto Mochizuki', 'Masahiro Tsujimoto', 'Caroline A. Kilbourne', 'Megan E.

Comparison of Equations of State for Neutron Stars with First-Order Phase Transitions: A Qualitative Study,"The equation of state is fundamental in describing matter under the extreme conditions characteristic of neutron stars and is central to advancing our understanding of dense matter physics. A critical challenge, however, lies in accurately modelling first-order phase transitions while ensuring thermodynamic consistency and aligning with astrophysical observations. This study explores two frameworks for constructing EoSs with first-order phase transitions: the polytropic interpolation method and the randomized speed-of-sound interpolation approach. It is found that the mass-radius relation and pressure vs. energy density relation are blind towards the thermodynamic consistency check. The polytropic interpolation method can exhibit discontinuities in the chemical potential for first-order phase transition, raising concerns regarding potential causality violations and thermodynamic inconsistencies. In contrast, the speed of sound interpolation approach ensures continuity in the chemical potential, offering a more thermodynamically consistent and reliable framework. Moreover, the sound speed method effectively captures the softer segment of the mass-radius spectrum, a capability not achieved by the consistent piecewise-polytropic approach due to its monotonic stiffness constraints. The speed of sound definition involving number density and chemical potential reveals the thermodynamic inconsistency, making it a more consistent and robust definition. These findings underscore the importance of thermodynamic consistency in EoS construction and highlight the advantages of the randomized speed-of-sound method for modelling phase transitions in dense matter.","['Anshuman Verma', 'Asim Kumar Saha', 'Ritam Mallick']",5.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06453,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,[],2025-01-14
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an Extraterrestrial Atmospheric Technosignature,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are prevalent in the universe and interstellar medium but are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources on Earth, such as fossil fuel combustion and firewood burning. Drawing upon the idea of PAHs as suitable candidates for technosignatures, we investigate the detectability of those PAHs that have available absorption cross-sections in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets (orbiting G-type stars at a distance of 10 parsecs) with an 8m mirror of Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Specifically, we focus on Naphthalene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, and Pyrene. Our simulations indicate that under current Earth-like conditions, detecting PAH signatures between 0.2-0.515 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ is infeasible. To account for the historical decline in PAH production post-industrial revolution, we explore varying PAH concentrations to assess instrumental capabilities to detect civilizations resembling modern Earth. We also evaluate telescope architectures (6m, 8m, and 10m mirror diameters) to put our results into the context of the future HWO mission. With these four molecules, PAH detection remains infeasible, even at concentrations ten times higher than current levels. While larger mirrors provide some advantages, they fail to resolve the spectral signatures of these molecules with significant signal-to-noise ratios. The UV absorption features of PAHs, caused by $\mathrm{\pi}$-orbital $\rightarrow$ $\mathrm{\pi^*}$-orbital electronic transitions, serve as valuable markers due to their distinct and detectable nature, preserved by the aromatic stability of PAHs. Additional lab measurements are necessary to gather absorption cross-section data beyond UV for more abundant PAHs. This may help further in improving the detectability of these molecules.","['Dwaipayan Dubey', 'Ravi Kopparapu', 'Barbara Ercolano', 'Karan Molaverdikhani']",5.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06462,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['Exoplanet atmospheres (487)'],2025-01-14
Study Self-lensing/Eclipsing Signals in Edge-on Double White-Dwarf Systems,"Stellar lightcurves from edge-on double white dwarf systems(DWDs) have periodic lensing/eclipsing signals at times of alignment between two components as seen by the observer. Here, we study the characterization and detection of these signals. In common DWDs, the Einstein radii have similar orders of magnitude with WDs' radii, and the projected source and lens radii normalized to the Einstein radius ($\rho_{\star}$, and $\rho_{\rm l}$) are $\sim 1$. Both of them are reduced with the orbital period and the lens mass. If $\rho_{\rm l}\simeq 1$ the lensing-induced minor image is always blocked by the lens which results lower magnification factors. If $\rho_{\rm l}\lesssim 1$ and in transit events the finite-lens effects decrease the lightcurves' width. When $\rho_{\rm l}\gtrsim1$ (happens for close DWDs including one low-mass and one massive WD) deep or complete eclipses dominate to lensing effects. The self-lensing signals maximize for massive DWDs in wide orbits. We study the detect-ability of lensing/eclipsing signals in edge-on DWDs in observations by The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS), The Vera Rubin Observatory(LSST) and The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We simulate stellar lightcurves due to edge-on DWDs and generate synthetic data points based on their observing strategies. Detection efficiency maximizes for extremely low-mass WDs in close orbits, and the numbers of DWDs within 100 pc and an observing cone with detectable lensing/eclipsing signals in one $27.4$-day TESS and $62$-day Roman observing window are $\sim1$ and $<1$, respectively.

New look at old friends: EVN imaging of prominent radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical positional offsets,"When comparing modern fundamental reference frames in the radio (International Celestial Reference Frame) and optical (Gaia), a couple of bright radio reference sources appear to have very large radio-optical offsets, from tens up to hundreds of milliarcseconds (mas). The amount of these positional misalignments exceeds the uncertainty of each individual technique by at least an order of magnitude. In most cases, complex and extended radio structure and its time variability, and thus the difficulty in pinpointing the true location of the central engine, is responsible for the large apparent offsets. Sometimes distant parts of the radio structure are not properly detected due to a lack of shorter interferometer baselines. For our 5-GHz very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment using antennas of the European VLBI Network and the enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network, we selected 10 bright radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical offsets. Sensitive imaging involving a wide range of projected baseline lengths, as well as phase-referencing to nearby sources shed light on the possible causes of positional inconsistencies. Here we show results for 3 selected sources from this project.","['S. Frey', 'O. Titov', 'A. Melnikov', 'S. Lambert']",3.0,4.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06513,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs),"Accurate and reliable photometric redshifts determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are determined. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). Proposed CGAN implementation, approaches photometric redshift determination as a probabilistic regression, where instead of determining a single value for the estimated redshift of the galaxy, a full probability density is computed.

FOGGIE X: Characterizing the Small-Scale Structure of the CGM and its Imprint on Observables,"One of the main unknowns in galaxy evolution is how gas flows into and out of galaxies in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studies observing the CGM in absorption using multiple or extended background objects suggest a high degree of variation on relatively small ($\lesssim 1$ kpc) spatial scales. Similarly, high-resolution simulations generally exhibit small-scale substructure in the gas around galaxies. We examine the small-scale structure of the $z = 1$ CGM using simulations from the FOGGIE (Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo) project. We select gaseous substructures (""clumps"") by their local overdensity and investigate their physical properties, including temperature, metallicity, and kinematics with respect to the galaxy and the nearby surroundings. FOGGIE resolves clumps down to sphericalized radii $R \sim 0.25$ kpc at $z = 1$. The distribution of clumps peaks at $\sim 10^5$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{4}$ K, consistent with relatively condensed, cool gas with a slight preference for inflow-like velocities. Many clumps show internal temperature and density variations, and thus internally varying ionization levels for key diagnostic ions such as HI, MgII, and OVI. The average metallicity in clumps is about a factor 1.5--2$\times$ lower in metallicity than nearby gas, suggesting that the metals are not well-mixed between structured and diffuse CGM, which may have implications for observational metallicity estimations of dense CGM clouds. We estimate the survivability of CGM clumps and find that structures larger than 0.5 kpc are generally long-lived. Finally, we qualitatively compare the simulated cloud properties to Milky Way high-velocity clouds.","['Ramona Augustin', 'Jason Tumlinson', 'Molly S. Peeples', ""Brian W. O'Shea"", 'Britton D.

Mission Analysis for the First-Ever Saturn Trojan 2019 UO$_{14}$,"In mid-2024, asteroid 2019 UO$_{14}$ was identified as the first-ever Saturn Trojan through ground-based archival observations and numerical simulations. Trojans, including those associated with Jupiter and other planets, raise important questions about the formation processes of our solar system. Exploring this Trojan object with spacecraft may provide direct answers and definitive evidence regarding these questions. This paper thoroughly investigates potential mission scenarios to the first Saturn Trojan, 2019 UO$_{14}$, to determine the necessary launch window and spacecraft specifications. First, by assuming a ballistic flight using chemical engines, optimal sequences of events, including (powered) gravity-assist maneuvers and deep-space maneuvers, are identified through a meta-heuristic global trajectory optimization algorithm. The analysis indicates that flyby exploration is feasible with a launch window around 2034 and a $\Delta V$ ranging from 92 m/s to 1041 m/s within an 11-year mission duration, while a rendezvous can be achieved with a departure around 2035 and a $\Delta V$ of 2-3 km/s. Specifically, the itinerary via Saturn requires a $\Delta V$ of 2 km/s and a flight time of 24.6 years, while the route via Jupiter results in a $\Delta V$ of 3 km/s and a flight time of 13.4 years. Given that the orbital motion of outer solar system objects is relatively slow, low-thrust propulsion, which gradually accelerates the spacecraft, proves to be effective. Consequently, low-thrust trajectories to 2019 UO$_{14}$ were examined. The results demonstrate that a rendezvous can be accomplished with nearly the same departure epoch, time of flight, and $\Delta V$ as in the ballistic flight, suggesting that low-thrust propulsion is highly compatible with the rendezvous scenario, as it significantly reduces the propellant mass fraction.",['Yuki Takao'],14.0,21.0,13.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06586,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,Asteroids ·Trojans ·Saturn ·Exploration ·Trajectory ·Optimization ,2025-01-14
Barrow Interacting holographic dark energy cosmology with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff: A model can Alleviating the Hubble and $S_{8}$ Tension,"In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) and matter clustering (\(S_8\)) tensions within the framework of non-interacting and interacting Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) models. Utilizing a combination of observational datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and lensing data, we assess the degree of tension relative to the Planck 2018 results and recent measurements such as the Riess et al. 2022 (R22) value for \(H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}\) in 68\% C.L and KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 for \(S_8\). Our findings show that both BHDE models mitigate the \(H_0\) and \(S_8\) tensions compared to the standard \(\Lambda\) Cold Dark Matter (\(\Lambda\)CDM) model. The non-interacting BHDE model achieves a moderate reduction in the \(H_0\) tension, while the interacting BHDE model offers a better fit for both parameters, suggesting it is more effective in addressing the tensions. Additionally, the quantum-gravitational deformation parameter \(\Delta\), constrained using the CMB+All dataset, indicates significant quantum effects in both models. The interacting scenario provides tighter constraints on \(\Delta\) and total neutrino mass \(\sum m_{\nu}\), offering a more precise representation of these effects.

Long-lived Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs undergoing Neon-22 Distillation,"White dwarf stars have attracted considerable attention in the past 15 years as hosts for potentially habitable planets, but their low luminosity and continuous cooling are major challenges for habitability. Recently, astronomers have found that about 6% of massive white dwarfs seem to have ""paused"" their cooling for up to ~10 Gyr. The leading explanation for this cooling delay is the distillation of neutron-rich isotopes such as $^{22}$Ne in the white dwarf's interior, which releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy as the star's internal structure rearranges. Here, we consider the impact of $^{22}$Ne distillation on the evolution of white dwarf habitable zones. We find that $^{22}$Ne distillation in the white dwarf host dramatically increases the time that a planet can continuously reside within the habitable zone (giving more time for life to arise) and that long-lasting habitable zones are located farther from the star (decreasing the impact of tidal forces). These properties may make white dwarfs undergoing $^{22}$Ne distillation more promising locations for habitability than white dwarfs undergoing standard cooling.","['Andrew Vanderburg', 'Antoine Bédard', 'Juliette C.

Determining the nature of IC 10 X-2: A comprehensive study of the Optical/Infrared emission from an extragalactic BeHMXB,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a super-giant HMXB and super-fast X-ray transient (SFXT) by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Factory and Las Cumbres Observatory over a ~5 year period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a $\sim26.5$~d period -- likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the Hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the neutron star. Lastly, the numerous, short duration, episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly ``redder'' or ``bluer'' than normal likely result from from clumps within this system -- which can accrete onto the neutron star (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer), or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respect to those thought to be common in the early Universe.","['Jwaher Alnaqbi', 'Joseph D.

"Comparing the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ SN cosmology analyses: Investigation based on ""Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae systematics?""","Recent cosmological analyses measuring distances of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) have all given similar hints at time-evolving dark energy. To examine whether underestimated SN Ia systematics might be driving these results, Efstathiou (2024) compared overlapping SN events between Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR (20% SNe are in common), and reported evidence for a $\sim$0.04 mag offset between the low and high-redshift distance measurements of this subsample of events. If these offsets are arbitrarily subtracted from the entire DES-SN5YR sample, the preference for evolving dark energy is reduced. In this paper, we reproduce this offset and show that it has two sources. First, 43% of the offset is due to DES-SN5YR improvements in the modelling of supernova intrinsic scatter and host galaxy properties. These are scientifically-motivated modelling updates implemented in DES-SN5YR and their associated uncertainties are captured within the DES-SN5YR systematic error budget. Even if the less accurate scatter model and host properties from Pantheon+ are used instead, the DES-SN5YR evidence for evolving dark energy is only reduced from 3.9$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. Second, 38% of the offset is due to a misleading comparison because different selection functions characterize the DES subsets included in Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR and therefore individual SN distance measurements are expected to be different because of different bias corrections. In conclusion, we confirm the validity of the published DES-SN5YR results.","['M. Vincenzi', 'R. Kessler', 'P. Shah', 'J. Lee', 'T. M. Davis', 'D. Scolnic', 'P. Armstrong', 'D. Brout', 'R.

Origin likelihood functions for extreme-energy cosmic rays,"Unlike neutrinos and photons arriving from extra-galactic sources, ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) do not trace back to their origins due to propagation effects such as magnetic deflections and energy losses. For ankle energies, UHECRs can propagate for hundreds of megaparsecs with negligible energy losses but the directional information is lost after a few megaparsecs. On the other hand, at the highest energies the directions are kept for larger distances due to the increased rigidity but the interaction rates with the cosmic microwave background strongly suppress the cosmic rays within a few to tens of megaparsecs. Therefore, UHECRs with energies $E > 10^{20}$ eV (extreme-energy cosmic rays (ExECRs)) such as the Amaterasu event recently reported by Telescope Array, are of particular interest to identify the sources within our galactic neighborhood. However, photonuclear interactions are stochastic in nature and produce changes in the nuclear species emitted, which makes it difficult the task of estimating the likelihood distribution of its origin. This work discusses a novel procedure to estimate the likelihood of the origin for extreme-energy cosmic rays based on probability distributions for UHECR stochastic interactions. The method is applied to the Amaterasu event and compared to recently published works which employ Monte Carlo codes (e.g. CRPropa) in their analysis. The advantages of the method presented here are demonstrated by the increased resolution and the ease of computation unlike other approaches employed so far. The results presented indicate that the localization of the origin of extreme energy cosmic rays could be possible in some cases without knowledge of the original composition.",['Leonel Morejon'],5.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06677,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,proceedings of the ECRS 2024,,[],2025-01-14
Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers,"The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.","['Sharan Banagiri', 'Thomas A.

BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code,"BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD ""Rome"" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.","['Yifu An', 'Yuxi Chen', 'Hongyang Zhou', 'Alexander Gaenko', 'Gábor Tóth']",5.0,17.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06717,Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'Computational Physics', 'Space Physics']",the Astrophysical Journal,,[],2025-01-14
Tracking Outflow using Line-Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-Locking Web identified in Quasar J151352+085555,"Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line-locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming 'line-locking web'. In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present discovery of one of the largest 'line-locking web' known to date from the VLT/UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C IV, N V, Si IV, O VI, and multiple Lyman lines (Ly${\alpha}$ to Ly${\epsilon}$), and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests the absorbers likely have sub-solar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states comparing to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows, and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.","['Chen Chen', 'Zhicheng He', 'Weimin Yi', 'Tuo Ji', 'Marie Wingyee Lau', 'Bo Ma']",12.0,17.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06734,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Impact of Coulomb Correction Factor on Rate of Change of Lepton Fraction during Presupernova Evolution,"We reexamine the weak interaction nuclei having largest contribution to the lepton to baryon fraction Ye by coupling the stellar weak rates and mass abundances for post silicon burning conditions during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The stellar weak rates were recently calculated by Nabi et al. 2021 employing the fully microscopic pnQRPA model without invoking the Brink Axel hypothesis. We compute the mass abundances for a total of 728 nuclei, with A equal 1to 100, using Sahas equation and assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium with the incorporation of Coulomb correction factor to the chemical potential. We compile a list of top 50 electron capture ec and \b{eta} decay bd nuclei on the basis of largest contribution to Ye forpost silicon burning conditions where 11 percent ec and 6percent bd nuclei debuted dueto Coulomb corrections. The calculated mass abundances and corresponding Ye values are enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude for heavier nuclei once Coulomb corrections were incorporated. This enhancement led to anincrement in total Y bde and Yece values, at Ye equal to 0.425 (\r{ho} equal 2.20 multiply 109 g/cm3 of 80percent and 91percent respectively. After incorporating the Coulomb corrections we propose a revised interval of Ye equal 0.423 0.455 where bd rates surpass thecompeting ec rates and is 3.2 percent bigger than the one suggested by Nabi et al.

Optical appearance of the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk,"In this study, we analyze the observational images of a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, wherein a thin accretion disk, serving as the sole background light source, is situated on the equatorial plane of the black hole. The inner boundary of the thin accretion disk extends to the event horizon, and the accretion material in the disk exhibits two different motion behaviors, that is, it moves along the critical plunging orbit inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and follows the Keplerian orbit outside the ISCO. The shadow image is captured on the imaging plane of a zero angular momentum observer utilizing advanced fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques. The results demonstrate that an image consistently reveals a dark region encircled by a narrow photon ring, which is called the inner shadow. At low observation inclination angles, the observation intensity is highly concentrated, with the lensed image of accretion disk being superimposed on the direct image. As observation inclination angle increases, the direct and lensed images gradually separate, becoming distinctly distinguishable and forming a hat-like structure. Furthermore, variations in the parameter space and observation angle will influence pertinent image characteristics, including image symmetry, the range or deformation degree of the inner shadow. We further examined the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Subsequently, we also examined the redshift distribution on the disk. The findings indicate that while variations in relevant parameters do influence the redshift distribution, the primary factor is the change in observational inclination. The observer can detect both redshift and blueshift phenomena on the screen when viewed at a higher observation angle.","['Ke-Jian He', 'Chen-Yu Yang', 'Xiao-Xiong Zeng']",13.0,32.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06778,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-14
"Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars","Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.","['Luca Boccioli', 'David Vartanyan', ""Evan P.

A comparative study of galaxy evolution with four different active galactic nucleus torus models and two different host geometries,"Estimating physical quantities such as the star formation rate, stellar mass and active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction of galaxies is a key step in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In order to estimate the uncertainties in the predicted values for these quantities, in this paper we explore the impact of adopting four different AGN torus models in fitting the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SED) of galaxies. We also explore the impact of adopting two different geometries for the host, a spheroidal geometry, more appropriate for late-stage mergers, and a disc geometry, more appropriate for galaxies forming stars with secular processes. We use optical to submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) and utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo SED-fitting code. We use exclusively radiative transfer models for the AGN torus as well as for the starburst and host galaxy. We concentrate on a sample of 200 galaxies at z~2, selected in the ELAIS-N1 field. All galaxies have a detection at 250um which ensures the presence of a starburst. We find that the stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies can be robustly estimated by the SED fitting but the AGN fraction depends very much on the adopted torus model. We also find that the vast majority of the galaxies in our sample are better fitted by a spheroidal geometry and lie above the main sequence. Our method predicts systematically higher SFR and lower stellar mass than the popular energy balance method CIGALE.","['Michail Papadopoulos', 'Vicky Papadopoulou Lesta', 'Ioannis Michos', 'Duncan Farrah', 'Andreas Efstathiou']",6.0,16.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06870,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,,['radiative transfer – galaxies: active – galaxies: interactions –quasars: general – infrared: galaxies – submillimetre: galaxies'],2025-01-14
Measurements of the Temperature and E-mode Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background from the Full 500-square-degree SPTpol Dataset,"Using the full four-year SPTpol 500 deg$^2$ dataset in both the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, we present measurements of the temperature and $E$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as well as the $E$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum ($EE$) and temperature-$E$-mode cross-power spectrum ($TE$) in the angular multipole range $50<\ell<8000$. We find the SPTpol dataset to be self-consistent, passing several internal consistency tests based on maps, frequency bands, bandpowers, and cosmological parameters. The full SPTpol dataset is well-fit by the $\Lambda CDM$ model, for which we find $H_0=70.48\pm2.16$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.271\pm0.026$, when using only the SPTpol data and a Planck-based prior on the optical depth to reionization. The $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are consistent across the 95 GHz-only, 150 GHz-only, $TE$-only, and $EE$-only data splits. Between the $\ell<1000$ and $\ell>1000$ data splits, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are borderline consistent at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. This consistency improves when including a parameter $A_L$, the degree of lensing of the CMB inferred from the smearing of acoustic peaks. When marginalized over $A_L$, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints from SPTpol are consistent with those from Planck. The power spectra presented here are the most sensitive measurements of the lensed CMB damping tail to date for roughly $\ell > 1700$ in $TE$ and $\ell > 2000$ in $EE$.","['T.-L. Chou', 'P. A. R.

Oscillations of Solitonic Galactic Cores in Ultralight Dark Matter,"A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.","['L.

Solar Particle Acceleration,"High-energy particles may be accelerated widely in stellar coronae; probably by the same processes we find in the Sun. Here, we have learned of two physical mechanisms that dominate the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs). The highest energies and intensities are produced in ""gradual"" events at shock waves driven from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Smaller, but more numerous, ""impulsive"" events with unusual particle composition are produced during magnetic reconnection in solar jets and flares. Jets provide open magnetic field lines where SEPs escape; closed magnetic loops contain this energy to produce bright, hot flares, perhaps even contributing to heating the low corona in profuse nanoflares. Streaming protons amplify Alfven waves upstream of the shocks. These waves scatter and trap SEPs and, in large events, modify the element abundances and flatten the low-energy spectra upstream. Shocks also reaccelerate residual ions from earlier impulsive events, when available, that characteristically dominate the energetic heavy-ion abundances. The large CME-driven shock waves develop an extremely wide longitude span, filling much of the inner heliosphere with energetic particles.",['Donald V.

Impact of Weak Lensing Mass Mapping Algorithms on Cosmology Inference,"Weak lensing mass mapping algorithms, which reconstruct the convergence field from galaxy shear measurements, are crucial for extracting higher-order statistics to constrain cosmological parameters. However, only limited research has explored whether the choice of mass mapping algorithm affects the inference of cosmological parameters from weak lensing higher-order statistics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different mass mapping algorithms on the inference of cosmological parameters measured with weak lensing peak counts. We employ Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass mapping algorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak lensing data. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as data vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that the choice of mass mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on cosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to 157$\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises from MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast, inpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires, indicating limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter estimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass mapping algorithms is thus critical for cosmological inference from weak lensing data. Advanced algorithms like MCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can substantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate mass mapping techniques in weak lensing studies to fully exploit the potential of higher-order statistics for cosmological research.","['Andreas Tersenov', 'Lucie Baumont', 'Jean-Luc Starck', 'Martin Kilbinger']",9.0,14.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06961,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['statistical – gravitational lensing: weak – cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe 1'],2025-01-14
AAS2RTO: Automated Alert Streams to Real-Time Observations: Preparing for rapid follow-up of transient objects in the era of LSST,"The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover tens of thousands of astrophysical transients per night, far outpacing available spectroscopic follow-up capabilities. Carefully prioritising candidates for follow-up observations will maximise the scientific return from small telescopes with a single-object spectrograph. We introduce AAS2RTO, an astrophysical transient candidate prioritisation tool written in Python. AAS2RTO is flexible in that any number of criteria that consider observed properties of transients can be implemented. The visibility of candidates from a given observing site is also considered. The prioritised list of candidates provided by AAS2RTO is continually updated when new transient data are made available. Therefore, it can be applied to observing campaigns with a wide variety of scientific motivations. AAS2RTO uses a greedy algorithm to prioritise candidates. Candidates are represented by a single numerical value, or `score'. Scores are computed by constructing simple numerical factors which individually consider the competing facets of a candidate which make it suitable for follow-up observation. AAS2RTO is currently configured to work primarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), distributed by certified LSST community brokers. We provide an example of how AAS2RTO can be used by defining a set of criteria to prioritise observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) close to peak brightness, in preparation for observations with the spectrograph at the Danish-1.54m telescope. Using a sample of archival alerts from ZTF, we evaluate the criteria we have designed to estimate the number of SNe Ia that we will be able to observe with a 1.5m telescope. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our criteria when applied to mock LSST observations of SNe Ia.","['Aidan Sedgewick', 'Christa Gall', 'Luca Izzo', 'Adriano Agnello', 'Charlotte R.

Stellar Population and Metal Production in AGN Disks,"As gravitational wave detections increase the number of observed compact binaries (consisting of neutron stars or blacks), we begin to probe the different conditions producing these binaries. Most studies of compact remnant formation focus either on stellar collapse from the evolution of field binary stars in gas-free environments or the formation of stars in clusters where dynamical interactions capture the compact objects, forming binaries. But a third scenario exists. In this paper, we study the fate of massive stars formed, accrete gas, and evolve in the dense disks surrounding supermassive black holes. We calculate the explosions produced and compact objects formed by the collapse of these massive stars. Nucleosynthetic yields may provide an ideal, directly observable, diagnostic of the formation and fate of these stars in active galactic nuclei. We present a first study of the explosive yields from these stars, comparing these yields with the observed nucleosynthetic signatures in the disks around supermassive stars with quasars. We show that, even though these stars tend to form black holes, their rapid rotation leads to disks that can eject a considerable amount of iron during the collapse of the star. The nucleosynthetic yields from these stars can produce constraints on the number of systems formed in this manner, but further work is needed to exploit variations from the initial models presented in this paper.","['Chris L.

A Spectroscopic and Interferometric Study of W Serpentis Stars. I. Circumbinary Outflow in the Interacting Binary W Serpentis,"W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid class of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense mass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both stars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here we present an observational analysis of high quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope and ARCES spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline interferometric observations obtained with the CHARA Array. We present examples of the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components: prominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption lines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with the cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the donor star. The donor's absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we derive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 +/- 0.09 based on the assumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously with the orbit. We use a fit of the ASAS light curve to determine the orbital inclination and mass estimates of 2.0 and 5.7 solar masses for the donor and gainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of orbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the distance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is enshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an outflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.","['Katherine Shepard', 'Douglas R.

State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background,"The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy.

Dark matter halo dynamics in 2D Vlasov Simulations: a self-similar approach,"Understanding dark matter halo dynamics can be pivotal in unravelling the nature of dark matter particles. Analytical treatment of the multistream flows inside the turnaround region of a collapsed cold dark matter (CDM) halo using various self-similar approaches already exist. In this work, we aim to determine the extent of self-similarity in 2D halo dynamics and the factors leading to deviations from it by studying numerical simulations of monolithically growing CDM halos. We have adapted the Fillmore and Goldreich (FG) self-similar solutions assuming cylindrical symmetry to data from 2D Vlasov-Poisson (ColDICE package) simulations of CDM halos seeded by sine wave initial conditions. We measured trajectories in position and phase-space, mass and density profiles and compared these to predictions from the FG model. We find that after turn-around and subsequent shell crossing, particles undergo a period of relaxation, typically about 1-2 oscillations about the center before they start to trace the self-similar fits and continue to do so as long as their orbits are predominantly radial. Overplotting the trajectories from different snapshots in scale-free position-time and phase spaces shows strikingly good superposition, a defining feature of self-similarity. The radial density profiles measured from simulations: $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}, \alpha = 0.9 - 1.0$ are consistent with FG's prediction $\alpha=1$ for 2D halos. Deviations from the model, on the other hand, are evidently linked to relaxation, inhibited motion due to periodic boundaries, transverse motion in the halo interior, and deficit of infalling mass in limited simulation volume. It could not be conclusively established if the halos tend to grow circular over time. Extension of this work to actual 3D CDM cosmologies necessitates further detailed study of self-similar solutions with ellipsoidal collapse and transverse motion.","['Abineet Parichha', 'Stephane Colombi', 'Shohei Saga', 'Atsushi Taruya']",13.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07001,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Dark Matter halo dynamics– Vlasov-Poisson simulations – Self-similarity 1'],2025-01-14
Verifying the Australian MWA EoR pipeline II: fundamental limits of the AusEoRPipe and the impact of instrumental effects,"Detection of the weak cosmological signal from high-redshift hydrogen demands careful data analysis and an understanding of the full instrument signal chain. Here we use the WODEN simulation pipeline to produce realistic data from the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionisation experiment, and test the effects of different instrumental systematics through the AusEoRPipe analysis pipeline. The simulations include a realistic full sky model, direction-independent calibration, and both random and systematic instrumental effects. Results are compared to matched real observations. We find that, (i) with a sky-based calibration and power spectrum approach we have need to subtract more than 90% of all unresolved point source flux (10mJy apparent) to recover 21-cm signal in the absence of instrumental effects; (ii) when including diffuse emission in simulations, some k-modes cannot be accessed, leading to a need for some diffuse emission removal; (iii) the single greatest cause of leakage is an incomplete sky model; (iv) other sources of errors, such as cable reflections, flagged channels and gain errors, impart comparable systematic power to one another, and less power than the incomplete skymodel.","['J.

The timing and spectral properties of the 2022 outburst of SGR J1935+2154 observed with NICER,"The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a new active episode on October 10, 2022, with X-ray bursts and enhanced persistent emission. At the tail of high burst rate interval, lasting several hours, radio bursts were detected, revealing the connection between the X-ray activities and radio emissions. We analyzed observations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly three months, using data from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We report the timing and spectral results following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the persistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light curve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of this flare. We found a phase jump of pulse profile, with a deviation of $0.16\pm0.03$ phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit with the combination of a blackbody and a power law model. The decay of the outburst is dominated by the drop of the non-thermal component, which also leads to the increase of thermal proportion.

Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties,"We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.","['Ankit Kumar', 'Hajime Sotani']",12.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07052,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['High Energy Physics - Theory', 'Nuclear Theory']",,,[],2025-01-14
Exploring mass transfer mechanisms in symbiotic systems,"We define two regimes of the parameter space of symbiotic systems based on the dominant mass transfer mechanism. A wide range of white dwarf (WD) mass, donor mass, and donor radius combinations are explored to determine the separation, for each parameter combination, below which wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) will be the dominant mass transfer mechanism. The underlying concept is the premise that the wind accelerates. If it reaches the Roche-lobe before attaining sufficient velocity to escape, it will be trapped, and gravitationally focused through the inner Lagrangian point towards the accreting WD. However, if the wind succeeds in attaining the required velocity to escape from the donor's Roche-lobe, it will disperse isotropically, and the dominant mass transfer mechanism will be the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescription in which only a fraction of the wind will be accreted onto the WD. We present, these two regimes of the four dimensional parameter space, covering 375 different parameter combinations.","['Irin Babu Vathachira', 'Yael Hillman', 'Amit Kashi']",4.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07067,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena'],ApJ,,"['novae—stars: AGB and post-AGB 1', 'accretion', 'accretion disks— binaries: close — binaries: symbiotic— cataclysmic variables']",2025-01-14
Neutrino-dominated relativistic viscous accretion flows around rotating black holes with shocks,"We investigate the relativistic, viscous, advective, neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar mass black holes, incorporating neutrino cooling. By adopting an effective potential to describe the spacetime geometry around the rotating black holes, we self-consistently solve the governing NDAF equations to obtain global transonic accretion solutions. Our findings indicate that, depending on the model parameters, namely energy ($\varepsilon$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}$), viscosity ($\alpha$) and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$), NDAFs may harbor standing shocks where the Rankine-Hugoniot shock conditions (RHCs) are satisfied. Utilizing these shock-induced NDAF solutions, we compute the neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$) across a wide range of model parameters. We further calculate maximum neutrino luminosity ($L_{\nu}^{\rm max}$) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ($L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max}$) resulting in $L_{\nu}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{51-53}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{48-51}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and $L_{\nu \bar{\nu}}^{\rm max} \sim 10^{48-52}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($10^{42-49}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for $a_{\rm k}=0.99$ (0.0). These findings suggest that shocked NDAF solutions are potentially promising to explain the energy output of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We employ our NDAF model formalism to elucidate $L^{\rm obs}_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$ for five GRBs with known redshifts and estimate their accretion rate (${\dot m}$) based on the spin ($a_{\rm k}$) of the central source of GRBs under consideration.","['Amit Kumar', 'Sayan Chakrabarti', 'Santabrata Das']",7.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07080,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['Accretion (14)'],2025-01-14
A Deep Search for a Strong Diffuse Interstellar Band in the Circumgalactic Medium,"We investigate the absorption signals of a strong diffuse interstellar band, DIB$\lambda4430$, in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) traced by MgII absorption lines. To this end, we make use of approximately 60,000 MgII absorption line spectra within $0.4<z<1.0$ compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys and obtain composite spectra with uncertainties for absorption line measurements being a few m$Å$. By using MgII absorption strength and dust reddening relation from the literature, we measure the DIB$\lambda4430$ absorption strength as a function of $\rm E(B-V)$ in the CGM, and compare the Milky Way DIB$\lambda4430$ - $\rm E(B-V)$ relation extrapolated down to the CGM $\rm E(B-V)$ region. Our results show no detectable signals of DIB$\lambda4430$ across the entire $\rm E(B-V)$ range in the CGM traced by MgII absorption lines. This lack of detection of DIB$\lambda4430$ in the CGM is inconsistent with the Milky Way signals by $\sim 5 \, \sigma$, indicating that the factors associated with different environments affect the abundance of the DIB$\lambda4430$ carrier.","['Chih-Yuan Chang', 'Ting-Wen Lan']",2.0,7.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07082,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,"['Diffuse interstellar bands (379)', 'and Intergalactic dust clouds (810) 1', 'Circumgalactic medium (1879)']",2025-01-14
On the origin of compressive turbulence in protoclumps in high redshift disks,"The giant, star forming clumps in gas-rich, high redshift disks are commonly assumed to form due to gravitational instabilities, in which protoclumps have a Toomre-$Q$ parameter less than unity. However, some cosmological simulations show that clumps can form in regions where $Q\gg1$. In these simulations, there is an excess of compressive modes of turbulence that lead to gravitational collapse of regions that were not supposed to gravitationally collapse, according to linear theory. In contrast, sites of clump formation in isolated simulations do not show this excess, hinting that the origin may be external. We explore two external mechanisms that can induce compressive modes of disk turbulence in protoclumps, namely, compressive tides exerted by the cosmological environment and the direct driving by inflowing streams. We correlate the local strength of compressive tides and the amount of fresh stream material with protoclump regions in zoom-in cosmological simulations. The local strength of compressive tides is derived from the tidal tensor. The local strength of incoming streams is derived from the fractional presence of the stream compared to the average. We find that the tidal field in protoclumps tends to be over-compressive while random patches in the disk show diverging tides. In particular, in $25\%$ of the protoclumps, the tidal field is fully compressive, while no random patch resides in regions of fully compressive tides. In addition, protoclumps tend to reside in regions where the fraction of incoming stream mass is 2-10 times larger than the average at the same galactocentric radius. Both compressive tides and inflowing streams are correlated with the protoclumps and can thus serve as the drivers of excessive compressive turbulence that can initiate clump formation. This constitutes a new, non-linear mode of violent disk instabilities in high-$z$ galaxies.","['Omry Ginzburg', 'Avishai Dekel', 'Nir Mandelker', 'Frederic Bournaud', 'Daniel Ceverino', 'Joel Primack']",13.0,15.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07097,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['ISM: Kinematics and dynamics – ISM: Structure – Galaxies: formation – Galaxies: high-redshift 1'],2025-01-14
Constraints on $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology using Cosmic Chronometers and Supernova data,"In this manuscript, we investigate the constraints on dynamical vacuum models within the framework of $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology by assuming a parameterization of the vacuum energy density as $\rho_{\Lambda}(t)=\rho_{\Lambda 0} \left[1 + \alpha (1 - a)\right]$, where $\rho_{\Lambda 0}$ is the present vacuum density and $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We use 31 cosmic chronometer data points and 1048 Pantheon type Ia supernova samples to constrain the model parameters. Our statistical analysis employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We have found that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion, transitioning from a decelerating phase. The transition redshift $z_t=0.65^{+0.03}_{-0.19}$ obtained from the combined CC+SNe dataset is consistent with recent constraints. The total EoS indicates an accelerating phase, with density parameters for matter and vacuum energy exhibiting expected behaviors. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows distinct behaviors for different datasets, and the present value of the jerk parameter deviates slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM model but remains consistent within uncertainties. These findings support the dynamic nature of dark energy and provide valuable constraints on the evolution of the universe.","['Yerlan Myrzakulov', 'M. Koussour', 'M. Bulanbay', 'S. Muminov', 'J.

Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.","['Lei Lei', 'Yi-Ying Wang', 'Guan-Wen Yuan', 'Tong-Lin Wang', 'Martin A.

Study of Migration of Giant Planets and Formation of Populations of Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Nice Model,"Numerical modeling of the interaction of giant planets and the planetesimal disk was carried out for the Nice model, in which the initial orbits of the planets are in resonant configurations. In addition to the standard Nice model, planetesimals in the planetary region were considered and the self-gravity of the planetesimal disk was taken into account. The dynamical evolution of planetary systems has been studied for time intervals on the order of the lifetime of the Solar System.

The diverse physical origins of stars in the dynamically hot bulge: CALIFA vs. IllustrisTNG,"We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.","['Le Zhang', 'Ling Zhu', 'Annalisa Pillepich', 'Min Du', 'Fangzhou Jiang', 'Jesús Falcón-Barroso']",15.0,18.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07151,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['methods: numerical – galaxies: kinematics – galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: star formation 1'],2025-01-14
"Observation and modeling of complex transient structure in heliosphere followed by geomagnetic storm on May 10-11, 2024","Complex CME/ICME structures in the solar wind often arising in the heliosphere as a result of interaction between two or more CMEs are very important due to their enhanced geoefficiency, but their modeling is difficult due to lack of observational data outside the solar corona. The outstanding evidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the strongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged from the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the series triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to consider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at three stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle heliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS observations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables to build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with enhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the heliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone base were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of 20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position corresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the modeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric distance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may characterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME interaction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1 position agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed expansion model.","['Denis Rodkin', 'Vladislav Lukmanov', 'Vladimir Slemzin', 'Igor Chashei']",5.0,26.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07160,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Space Physics'],,,"['Solar wind', 'Interplanetary Scintillations 1', 'Coronal Mass Ejection', 'Observation and Modeling']",2025-01-14
Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars,"In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.","['Hao Sun', 'Jia-Xing Niu', 'Hong-Bo Li', 'Cheng-Jun Xia', 'Enping Zhou', 'Yiqiu Ma', 'Ying-Xun Zhang']",9.0,12.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07188,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Nuclear Theory'],,,[],2025-01-14
Rotation periods of asteroids from light curves of TESS data,"Understanding the dynamical evolution of asteroids through the secular Yarkovsky effect requires the determination of many physical properties, including the rotation period. We propose a method aimed at obtaining a robust determination of the rotation period of asteroids, while avoiding the pitfalls of aliases. We applied this approach to thousands of asteroid light curves measured by the NASA TESS mission. We developed a robust period-analysis algorithm based on a Fourier series. Our approach includes a comparison of the results from multiple orders and tests on the number of extremes to identify and reject potential aliases. We also provide the uncertainty interval for the result as well as additional periods that may be plausible. We report the rotation period for 4521 asteroids within a precision of 10%. A comparison with the literature (whenever available) reveals a very good agreement and validates the approach presented here. Our approach also highlights cases for which the determination of the period should be considered invalid. The dataset presented here confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50 and 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is found to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less spherical. Finally, there is a systematic difference between the broad C and S complex in the amplitude-period, revealing the statistically lower density of C-types compared to S-type asteroids. Conclusions. Our approach to the determination of asteroid rotation period is based on simple concepts, yet it is nonetheless robust. It can be applied to large corpora of time series photometry, such as those extracted from exoplanet transit surveys.","['D. E. Vavilov', 'B.

Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU,"A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($<0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux.

Markarian 590: The AGN Awakens,"Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) Mkn 590 recently underwent a sudden \lq re-ignition\rq, marked by substantial increases in optical/UV and X-ray continuum flux since last year. \textit{Swift}-XRT observations revealed the re-emergence of a soft X-ray excess (SXE) as the source transitioned from a low-flux state in July 2023 to a significantly higher flux state in October 2024.

Follow-up optical spectra from the Las Cumbres Observatory confirmed the presence of dynamically broadened Balmer lines, He II emission, and the emergence of the Fe II complex. As the Eddington fraction increased by 10\% over the last 15 months, we found clear evidence of formation of a warm corona, strongly linked to the cold accretion disc underneath.

Comparison of Global HI and H$\alpha$ Line Profiles in MaNGA Galaxy Pairs with FAST,"We present case studies comparing the global HI and H$\alpha$ emission line profiles of six galaxy pairs. The six pairs are selected to have different nuclear activities, with two hosting an active galactic nucleus, and in different merging stages (two of each from pre-merging, merging, and post-merger stages). We observe their global HI spectra with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), achieving a noise level of about 0.5 mJy. Five out of the six pair systems have secure detections of HI emissions (signal-to-noise ratio > 10). The HI fraction and star formation efficiency of the six pairs do not deviate from isolated galaxies. For the HI line profiles, common unique asymmetry is observed, indicating disturbances on the atomic gas from the galaxy interaction. The global H$\alpha$ spectra of the merger systems are constructed from the optical integral field spectroscopic observations, by integrating the flux in corresponding line-of-sight velocity bins. The H$\alpha$ spectra tend to show multiple components in the pre-merger phase, and single component line profiles in the post-merger systems, while all HI spectra show single component line profiles regardless of merger stages. The HI and H$\alpha$ spectra show offsets in the central velocities, which appear to decrease from >100 km/s in the pre-merger pair to <10 km/s in post-merger pairs. This trend is consistent with the scenario that, despite the significantly different distribution and kinematics of the atomic and ionized gases, the merging process may contribute to the mixing and eventually align various gas contents.","['Gaoxiang Jin', 'Y.

"Optical and NIR spectral analysis of a post-starburst galaxy at $z \sim 2$ : probing the stellar population properties, gas content, and contribution of TP-AGB stars","We present the spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy observed at $z=1.8845$ with JWST, for which we estimate a stellar mass M$_* = 3.5\pm0.2\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_* = 198\pm10$ km/s. From the fits of the NIRspec low-resolution prism and medium resolution grating spectra, we estimate an age of $\sim0.9$ Gyr, a metallicity of $\sim -0.3$ dex, and a dust attenuation A$_{\rm V} \sim 0.7$ mag. From the H$\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines we derive a star-formation rate (SFR)$\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a specific SFR$\sim 4 \times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$. By reconstructing its SFH, we find that this galaxy formed most of its stellar mass quickly ($0.4-0.8$ Gyr) and then rapidly quenched about 0.4 Gyr lookback time. The analysis of the emission lines ([OII], [NeIII], [OIII], H$\alpha$, and [NII]) indicates a low-level residual star formation or a weak AGN as the ionization source. Further, the lack of evidence for ongoing outflows in both the absorption and emission lines tracing the neutral and ionized gas argues against the presence of strong AGN feedback. Thanks to the high quality of the data, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the NIR spectral indices. This is the first time NIR spectral indices have been investigated at such a high redshift. We find that the observed CO and CN indices are generally weak and in better agreement with models with a lower contribution from thermally pulsating (TP-)AGB stars, indicating that either TP-AGB stars do not contribute significantly to the spectrum of J-138717 or the prescriptions in the models for these evolved phases should be substantially improved. In general, we find that all models struggle to reproduce the NIR indices consistently, pointing to the importance of improving state-of-the-art stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages.","['Davide Bevacqua', 'Paolo Saracco', 'Francesco La Barbera', 'Guido De Marchi', 'Roberto De Propris', 'Fabio Ditrani', 'Anna R.

"X-ray activity of nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars and implications for planet habitability around M stars","Context. The intense X-ray and UV emission of some active M stars has raised questions about the habitability of planets around M-type stars. Aims. We aim to determine the unbiased distribution of X-ray luminosities in complete, volume-limited samples of nearby M dwarfs, and compare them to those of K and G dwarfs. Methods. We constructed volume-complete samples of 205 M stars with a spectral type $\leq$ M6 within 10 pc of the Sun, 129 K stars within 16 pc, and 107 G stars within 20 pc. We used X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ROSAT to obtain the X-ray luminosities of the stars. Results. Our samples reach an X-ray detection completeness of 85%, 86%, and 80% for M, K, and G stars, respectively. The fractional X-ray luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities, $\log(L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol})$, of the M stars show a bimodal distribution, with one peak at around -5, mostly contributed by early M stars (M0--M4), and another peak around -3.5, contributed mainly by M4--M6 stars. The comparison of the different spectral classes shows that 63% of all M stars in our sample (80% of the M stars with a spectral type $<$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ values that are within the central 80% quantile of the distribution function for G stars. In addition, 55% of all M stars in our sample (and 72% of the M stars with a spectral type $<$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ less than 10 times the solar value. Conclusions. The X-ray activity levels of the majority ($\ge 60\%$) of nearby M dwarfs no later than M6 are actually not higher than the typical (80% quantile) levels for G-type stars. The X-ray irradiation of habitable-zone planets around these stars should therefore not present a specific problem for their habitability.","['E. Zhu', 'T.

Galaxy mass-size segregation in the cosmic web from the CAVITY parent sample,"The mass-size relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law closely tied to galaxy formation and evolution. Using added-value products of the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) and SDSS DR16 images, we examine the effect of large-scale environments on the stellar mass-size relation. We analyse the Petrosian R50 and R90 radii of approximately 140000 galaxies in voids, filaments, and clusters, with a mass range of $10^{8.5} - 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We explore the relation in terms of galaxy morphology and star formation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type void galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser environments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the mass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope compared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in filaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type cluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$ are smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density environments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale environments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to grow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size growth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced minor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter slope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a trend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\approx 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, where minor mergers contribute to size growth. Conversely, late-type quenched cluster galaxies are smaller due to environmental interactions, with early infallers being most affected.","['I. Perez', 'L. Gil', 'A. Ferre-Mateu', 'G.

A multi-wavelength view of the isolated neutron star eRASSU J065715.3+260428,"The X-ray source eRASSU J065715.3+260428 was identified as a likely thermally emitting isolated neutron star in a search in the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. We investigated the nature and evolutionary state of the source through a dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaign with XMM-Newton, NICER, FAST, and ESO-VLT, complemented by the analysis of archival Fermi-LAT observations. The X-ray observations unveiled the rotation period, $P=261.085400(4)$ ms, and spin-down rate, $\dot{P}=6^{+11}_{-4}\times10^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$, of the source. No optical counterparts are detected down to 27.3 mag ($5\sigma$, R band), implying a large X-ray-to-optical flux ratio above 5200. The X-ray spectrum of the source is best described by a composite phenomenological model consisting of two thermal components, either a double blackbody continuum with temperatures 90 eV and 220 eV or a hydrogen neutron star atmosphere of temperature $\log(T/\mathrm{K})\sim 5.8$ combined with a hot blackbody of 250 eV, in both cases modified by an absorption feature at low energies ($\sim0.3$ keV). The presence of faint non-thermal hard X-ray tails is ruled out above $(2.1\pm1.8)$% of the source unabsorbed flux. Radio searches at $1-1.5$ GHz with FAST yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed flux of 1.4 $\mu$Jy ($10\sigma$). Similarly, no significant spatial or pulsed signals were detected in sixteen years of Fermi-LAT observations. The source is most likely a middle-aged spin-powered pulsar and can also be identified as PSR J0657+2604. The absence of non-thermal X-ray, radio, or gamma-ray emission within current limits suggests either an unfavourable viewing geometry or unusual magnetospheric properties. Additional observations are needed to check for faint hard X-ray tails, investigate the presence of diffuse emission from a pulsar-wind nebula, and obtain a more accurately sampled timing solution.","['J.

Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data,"There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) > 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) < 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.","['Tian-Nuo Li', 'Guo-Hong Du', 'Yun-He Li', 'Peng-Ju Wu', 'Shang-Jie Jin', 'Jing-Fei Zhang', 'Xin Zhang']",3.0,10.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07361,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-01-14
Science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission,"The Einstein Probe (EP) is an interdisciplinary mission of time-domain and X-ray astronomy. Equipped with a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray focusing imager, EP will discover cosmic X-ray transients and monitor the X-ray variability of known sources in 0.5-4 keV, at a combination of detecting sensitivity and cadence that is not accessible to the previous and current wide-field monitoring missions. EP can perform quick characterisation of transients or outbursts with a Wolter-I X-ray telescope onboard. In this paper, the science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission are presented. EP is expected to enlarge the sample of previously known or predicted but rare types of transients with a wide range of timescales. Among them, fast extragalactic transients will be surveyed systematically in soft X-rays, which include {\gamma}-ray bursts and their variants, supernova shock breakouts, and the predicted X-ray transients associated with binary neutron star mergers. EP will detect X-ray tidal disruption events and outbursts from active galactic nuclei, possibly at an early phase of the flares for some. EP will monitor the variability and outbursts of X-rays from white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in our and neighbouring galaxies at flux levels fainter than those detectable by the current instruments, and is expected to discover new objects. A large sample of stellar X-ray flares will also be detected and characterised. In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, EP has the potential of detecting the possible X-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, neutrino sources, and ultra-high energy {\gamma}-ray and cosmic ray sources. EP is expected to help advance the studies of extreme objects/phenomena and their underlying physical processes revealed in the dynamic X-ray universe, as well as studies in other areas of X-ray astronomy.","['Weimin Yuan', 'Lixin Dai', 'Hua Feng', 'Chichuan Jin', 'Peter Jonker', 'Erik Kuulkers', 'Yuan Liu', 'Kirpal Nandra', ""Paul O'Brien"", 'Luigi Piro', 'Arne Rau', 'Nanda Rea', 'Jeremy Sanders', 'Lian Tao', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Xuefeng Wu', 'Bing Zhang', 'Shuangnan Zhang', 'Shunke Ai', 'Johannes Buchner', 'Esra Bulbul', 'Hechao Chen', 'Minghua Chen', 'Yong Chen', 'Yu-Peng Chen', 'Alexis Coleiro', 'Francesco Coti Zelati', 'Zigao Dai', 'Xilong Fan', 'Zhou Fan', 'Susanne Friedrich', 'He Gao', 'Chong Ge', 'Mingyu Ge', 'Jinjun Geng', 'Giancarlo Ghirlanda', 'Giulia Gianfagna', 'Lijun Gou', 'Sébastien Guillot', 'Xian Hou', 'Jingwei Hu', 'Yongfeng Huang', 'Long Ji', 'Shumei Jia', 'S.

Unlocking ultra-deep wide-field imaging with sidereal visibility averaging,"Producing ultra-deep high-angular-resolution images with current and next-generation radio interferometers introduces significant computational challenges. In particular, the imaging is so demanding that processing large datasets, accumulated over hundreds of hours on the same pointing, is likely infeasible in the current data reduction schemes. In this paper, we revisit a solution to this problem that was considered in the past but is not being used in modern software: sidereal visibility averaging (SVA). This technique combines individual observations taken at different sidereal days into one much smaller dataset by averaging visibilities at similar baseline coordinates. We present our method and validated it using four separate 8-hour observations of the ELAIS-N1 deep field, taken with the International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) at 140~MHz. Additionally, we assessed the accuracy constraints imposed by Earth's orbital motion relative to the observed pointing when combining multiple datasets. We find, with four observations, data volume reductions of a factor of 1.8 and computational time improvements of a factor of 1.6 compared to standard imaging. These factors will increase when more observations are combined with SVA. For instance, with 3000~hours of LOFAR data aimed at achieving sensitivities of the order of {\mu}Jy/beam at sub-arcsecond resolutions, we estimate data volume reductions of up to a factor of 169 and a 14-fold decrease in computing time using our current algorithm. This advancement for imaging large deep interferometric datasets will benefit current generation instruments, such as LOFAR, and upcoming instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), provided the calibrated visibility data of the individual observations are retained.","['J.M.G.H.J. de Jong', 'R.J. van Weeren', 'T.J.

Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments,"Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for computing the afterglow emission. Our procedure is general and applicable to any jet simulation of the same kind.","['Emma Dreas', 'Andrea Pavan', 'Riccardo Ciolfi', 'Annalisa Celotti']",15.0,13.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07385,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,['magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – gamma-ray burst: general – stars: jets – relativistic processes – methods: numerical 1'],2025-01-14
Is planetary inward migration responsible for GJ 504's fast rotation and bright X-ray luminosity? New constraints from eROSITA,"The discovery of an increasing variety of exoplanets in very close orbits around their host stars raised many questions about how stars and planets interact, and to which extent host stars' properties may be influenced by the presence of close-by companions. Understanding how the evolution of stars is impacted by the interactions with their planets is fundamental to disentangle their intrinsic evolution from Star-Planet Interactions (SPI)-induced phenomena. GJ 504 is a promising candidate for a star that underwent strong SPI. Its unusually short rotational period (3.4 days), while being in contrast with what is expected by single-star models, could result from the inward migration of a close-by, massive companion, pushed starward by tides. Moreover, its brighter X-ray luminosity may hint at a rejuvenation of the dynamo process sustaining the stellar magnetic field, consequent to the SPI-induced spin-up. We aim to study the evolution of GJ 504 and establish whether by invoking the engulfment of a planetary companion we can better reproduce its rotational period and X-ray luminosity. We simulate the past evolution assuming two different scenarios: 'Star without close-by planet', 'Star with close-by planet'. In the second scenario, we investigate how inward migration and planetary engulfment driven by tides spin up the stellar surface and rejuvenate its dynamo. We compare our tracks with rotational period and X-ray data collected from the all-sky surveys of the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). Despite the very uncertain stellar age, we found that the second evolutionary scenario is in better agreement with the short rotational period and the bright X-ray luminosity of GJ 504, thus strongly favouring the inward migration scenario over the one in which close-by planets have no tidal impact on the star.","['C.

Dusty disk as a safe haven for terrestrial planets: Effect of back-reaction of solid material on gas,"Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We perform locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations are compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component is assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St<=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2<=St<=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.","['Zs.

A Study of thin relativistic magnetic accretion disk around a distorted black hole,"Accretion disks, swirling structures of matter spiraling into black holes, play a pivotal role in our understanding of binary star systems and their intricate evolutionary processes. While current models often simplify these complex phenomena by neglecting the influence of powerful magnetic fields, particularly within warped or distorted black hole geometries, this study delves into the crucial impact of such fields. Focusing on a thin accretion disk encircling a Schwarzschild black hole, we meticulously investigate how the presence of a quadrupole moment, an inherent distortion in the black hole's shape, affects its spectral characteristics. By analyzing key parameters like total pressure, magnetic pressure, temperature, height scale, surface density, and radiative flux (the energy emitted by the disk) we reveal significant alterations induced by incorporating both magnetic fields and a quadrupole moment. Notably, our findings demonstrate that negative quadrupoles exert a more pronounced influence on these disk properties, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors. This comprehensive study provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of accretion disks surrounding distorted black holes with magnetic fields, paving the way for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of these fascinating astrophysical systems.","['Seyyed Masoud Hoseyni', 'Jamshid Ghanbari', 'Mahboobe Moeen Moghaddas']",8.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07407,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,quadrupole accretion disk predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity has spurred extensive theoretical investigation distorted schwarzschild black hole ,2025-01-14
First mid-infrared detection and modeling of a flare from Sgr A*,"The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths $\sim$40--70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at $1.3~\mathrm{mm}$ with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by $\approx$10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.","['Sebastiano D. von Fellenberg', 'Tamojeet Roychowdhury', 'Joseph M.

The GRACE project: Hard X-ray giant radio galaxies and their duty cycle,"The advent of new generation radio telescopes is opening new possibilities on the classification and study of extragalactic high-energy sources, specially the underrepresented ones like radio galaxies. Among these, Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG, larger than 0.7 Mpc) are among the most extreme manifestations of the accretion/ejection processes on supermassive black holes. Our recent studies have shown that GRG can be up to four times more abundant in hard X-ray selected (i.e. from INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT at $>$20 keV) samples and, most interestingly, the majority of them present signs of restarted radio activity. This makes them the ideal test-bed to study the so far unknown duty cycle of jets in active galactic nuclei. Open questions in the field include: How and when jets are restarted? How jets evolve and what's their dynamic? What is the jet's duty cycle and what triggers them? Our group has recently collected a wealth of radio data on these high-energy selected GRGs, allowing us to study their jet formation and evolution from the pc to kpc scales, across different activity epochs. In particular, thanks to our EVN large programme, we were able to probe the new radio phase in the core of these giants. Furthermore, we are devoting an effort to the exploitation of new radio surveys data for the discovery of new classes of counterparts of Fermi/LAT catalogues.

MeerKAT HI imaging of the jellyfish galaxy ESO 137-001,"We present MeerKAT HI observations of ESO 137-001, a quintessential jellyfish galaxy with long multi-phase tails formed due to the interaction with the intra-cluster medium of its host galaxy cluster, ACO 3627. Our observations reveal the presence of HI in both the disc and outer regions of the galaxy for the first time, with a total HI mass of ($3.5 \pm\ 0.4) \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. ESO 137-001 is at an advanced stage of gas stripping; it is extremely HI deficient and seems to have lost 90% of its initial HI mass; about 2/3 of the surviving HI is found at a larger radius than expected for a normal HI disc and forms a $\sim40$ kpc tail coincident with the tail detected at other wavelengths. Only $\sim10$% of the surviving HI is still found within the stellar disc, consistent with the expectation of an outside-in truncation due to ram pressure. Similarly to other jellyfish galaxies, ESO137-001 has a high star formation rate for the low amount of HI detected. We measure an HI depletion time of 0.29 Gyr. However, when taking into account the total gas (HI + H$_2$) content, the depletion time is consistent with typical values measured in nearby spiral galaxies. This suggests that ESO 137-001 is at its current stage of ram pressure interaction characterised by an efficient HI stripping, rather than an enhanced conversion of HI to H$_2$, which was recently observed in some other jellyfish galaxies.","['M.

A flux-limited sample of dusty star-forming galaxies from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope: physical properties and the case for multiplicity,"We report the modeling of the millimeter and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of 71 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with a lower flux-density limit of 8 mJy at 220 GHz (1.4 mm). All sources were cross-identified with Herschel surveys at 500, 350, and 250 {\mu}m, and nineteen of our sources were observed at with the Submillimeter Array. A probabilistic cataloging algorithm, PCAT, favors multiple unresolved flux components in the Herschel data for the majority of ACT-selected DSFGs. We compare the derived physical properties of the DSFGs obtained from modeling the flux densities with those from similar studies of both lensed and unlensed DSFG populations. We find the median, 16th and 84th percentiles for the following model parameters: redshift zphot=3.3(+0.7)(-0.6), apparent size {\mu}d=5.2(+0.9)(-2.4) kpc, apparent dust mass log10({\mu}Md/Msun)=9.14(+0.12)(-0.04) and cutoff temperature Tc=35.6(+4.8)(-1.6) K, and the corresponding apparent far-infrared luminosity log10({\mu}LIR/Lsun)=13.6(+0.2)(-0.3), where {\mu} is lensing magnification. While many of the properties broadly agree with those of samples of primarily lensed DSFGs, we exercise caution in interpreting them. ACT's lower flux limit, the PCAT decomposition, and the higher-resolution SMA observations all suggest that some fraction of these DSFGs are likely to be unlensed and possibly multiples. The SMA data indicate that at least fourteen out of nineteen sources are such, either via ""missing"" flux in comparison to the ensemble model or detection of additional sources in the fields. Additional high-resolution follow-up and targeted redshift observations are needed to better understand this flux-limited sample of DSFGs.","['Kirsten R. Hall', 'Jake Hassan', 'Richard M.

Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?,"Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.","['Pierre Dumond', 'Gilles Chabrier']",6.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07436,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],A&A,,"['Methods: analytical — Stars: formation', 'mass function — Turbulence 1', 'luminosity function']",2025-01-14
Metal-THINGS: The Milky Way twin candidate NGC 3521,"The 3D spectrophotometry measurements of the galaxy NGC~3521, a structural Milky Way analogue (sMWA), were carried out within the Metal-THINGS project. We found that the oxygen abundance in the inner part of NGC~3521 is at a nearly constant level and the O/H gradient is negative at larger radii. The change in the N/H with radius is similar to that for O/H. The radial distributions of the O/H, the gas mass fraction, and the effective oxygen yield in NGC~3521 are compared to that of the Milky Way (MW), with the aim of examining the similarity in their chemical evolutions. The O/H of two HII regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned O/H in NGC~3521 at the same galactocentric distances. The O/H in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC~3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC~3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Yeff, in NGC~3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Yo. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Yeff in the MW were determined using two variants of the distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Yeff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Yo. The Yeff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Yo at radii between 6 and 10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.","['L.S.

Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole,"We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., O, A, and I-types), including the shock solutions, are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the accretion solutions are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the BH horizon. In this context, we also observe that various shock properties, such as the shock radius, flow density compression, and temperature compression across the shock fronts, are potentially affected by the dark halo. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow angular momentum and energy, is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. Furthermore, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED), slope of the SED, and bolometric luminosity, are found to exhibit strong deviations from the known results in the usual Schwarzschild BH model. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic BH.","['Subhankar Patra', 'Bibhas Ranjan Majhi']",7.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07456,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,['accretion'],2025-01-14
Deep Needlet: A CNN based full sky component separation method in Needlet space,"One of the most important steps of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is component separation to recover CMB map by combining the observations contaminated by foregrounds. Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum variance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to recover CMB. This work develops a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recover CMB map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over the full sky. The model allows to perform component separation with a multi-resolution representation of spherical data localized on both pixel space and harmonic space with rotational invariant features of CMB. The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit different foreground complexities. The model achieves precise recovery of the CMB temperature map and the TT power spectrum exhibits excellent agreement with true value up to $\ell\sim$1100. The residual leakage to the recovered CMB is reduced significantly compared to the CMB map recovered using NILC pipeline. Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3 data to recover CMB. The recovered CMB map shows excellent agreement with CMB maps of Planck legacy products using NILC and SMICA pipelines.

Model-independent forecasts for the cosmological anisotropic stress,"The effective anisotropic stress $\eta$ is a key variable in the characterization of many classes of modified gravity theories, as it allows the testing for a long-range force additional to gravity. In this paper we forecast the precision with which future large surveys can determine $\eta$ in a way that only relies on directly observable quantities obtained from the spectroscopic measurements of the clustering of galaxies and the photometric based observation of the projected lensing and galaxy clustering correlations and their cross signal. Our method does not require further assumptions about the initial power spectrum, the modified gravity model, the expansion rate, or the bias. We consider various cases: $\eta$ free to vary in space and time, or with only redshift dependence, or constant. We take as a reference specifications that approximate a Euclid-like photometric or a combined one with a DESI-like spectroscopic survey. Among our results, we find that a future large-scale lensing and clustering survey can constrain $\eta$ to at least 30\% if $z$, $k$ independent, and to less than 10\% on average for the $z$ dependence only, to finally reach 5\% values in the constant case.","['Ziad Sakr', 'Ziyang Zheng', 'Santiago Casas']",7.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07477,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,['Cosmology: observations – Gravity – dark matter – dark energy 1 INTRODUCTION Withthelatestconstraintsonthecosmologicalparametersfromthecosmicmicrowavebackground(CMB)correlationmeasurementsfromthe Planck satellite (Aghanim et al'],2025-01-14
Exploring Temperature Influences on Gravitational Wave Production in Binary White Dwarfs,"This study investigates the conditions under which gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted during the merger of hot white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary system. Traditionally, these systems consist of two low-mass stars or a more massive WD paired with a less massive companion. In addition, recent work has investigated the possibility that double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic WDs , particularly SDSS J221141.80 + 113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9 + 145808.7 (hereafter J1901 + 14588). Motivated by these findings and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) prospects, this study aims to calculate the tidal Love number, the dimensionless tidal deformability, as well as the frequency and amplitude of GWs of hot WDs. The results indicate that the tidal deformability is more pronounced in stars with higher central temperatures and lower masses, which would lead to reduced emission of GWs. In contrast, more massive stars exhibit less deformability, making them prime candidates for generating stronger GWs. Additionally, the analysis of frequency and amplitude reveals that the frequencies of high-mass binaries are smaller and evolve more rapidly, reaching a limit that aligns with the operational detection capabilities of LISA during its initial phase.","['Sílvia P.

A critical evaluation of the elemental abundances and evolutionary status of 15 Vul (HD 189849): The first identification of an evolved Am star,"Understanding the evolution of metallic-line (Am) stars requires well determined atmospheric parameters and abundance patterns of the selected candidates. In this study, we presented a detailed abundance analysis of 15 Vul (HD 189849), identified as a marginal Am star, using a combination of equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques, under the LTE assumption. We compared our findings to previous analyses of the star, providing critique on both their results and our own. Our results suggest that although 15 Vul exhibits some underabundances of calcium and scandium, which are typically associated with Am stars, it might be more accurately identified as a normal A star in terms of its abundance pattern of all other elements and microturbulence velocity. The star's position on the HR diagram, along with our findings, may indicate that it is potentially a classical Am star that has evolved into the subgiant phase as a ""quasi-normal"" star. This may be the first identification of an evolved Am star.","['M. Taşkın Çay', 'İpek H.

Deriving the abundance distribution of HII galaxies using sulphur as tracer: Exploring the high-metallicity end,"The main objective of this work is to derive the distribution of the the metal content of HII galaxies using sulphur as an abundance tracer. This increases the metallicity range that can safely be reached. We selected a sample of emission-line galaxies that we extracted from the SDSS-DR16. These objects have a redshift of z less than 0.04 so that the [SIII] 9069 A emission line and H beta equivalent widths that are higher than 10 A in emission were included, and they are compact in appearance. We used the so-called direct method for objects with the electron-temperature-sensitive [SIII] 6312 A emission line, and an empirical method based on the S23 parameter. The last provided an abundance calibration that monotonically increased up to at least the solar value, and can be applied based on the spectral range from 6000 to 9500 A alone. We show that the bias that is introduced when the [OIII] 4363 A line is required restricts the sample to objects with an [OIII] electron temperature higher than 10,000K, and their temperature distribution is then rather narrow. For objects with determinations of te [SIII], the distribution is flatter and wider, which fits a more realistic scenario better. For the objects in the sample that required the detection of the [OIII] 4363 A line and [SIII] 6312 A, the distribution abundances as traced directly by oxygen and sulphur appear to be very similar to each other. However, when the restriction for weak temperature-sensitive lines is relaxed, the abundance distribution is wider . In summary, the abundance distributions traced by sulphur can reach reliable abundances up to the solar value at least and provide a more complete picture of the metallicity distribution of HII galaxies.","['Marta Gavilán', 'Ángeles I.

Three-dimensional transport of solids in a protoplanetary disk containing a growing giant planet,"We present the results of combined hydrodynamic and particle tracking post-processing modeling to study the transport of small dust in a protoplanetary disk containing an embedded embryo in 3D. We use a suite of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations of disks containing a planetary embryo varying in mass up to 300 $M_\oplus$ on a fixed orbit in both high and low viscosity disks. We then simulate solid particles through the disk as a post-processing step using a Monte Carlo integration, allowing us to track the trajectories of individual particles as they travel throughout the disk. We find that gas advection onto the planet can carry small, well-coupled solids across the gap opened in the disk by the embedded planet for planetary masses above the pebble isolation mass. This mixing between the inner and outer disk can occur in both directions, with solids in the inner disk mixing to the outer disk as well. Additionally, in low viscosity disks, multiple pile-ups in the outer disk may preserve isotopic heterogeneities, possibly providing an outermost tertiary isotopic reservoir. Throughout Jupiter's growth, the extent of mixing between isotopic reservoirs varied depending on dust size, gas turbulence, and the Jovian embryo mass.","['Eric Van Clepper', 'Ellen M.

Magnetically arrested disk flux eruption events to describe SgrA* flares,"Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots, formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light. Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ, 180^\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise naturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for reproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.","['Eleni Antonopoulou', 'Argyrios Loules', 'Antonios Nathanail']",7.0,10.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07521,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,['black hole physics – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – radiative transfer – Galaxy:center – relativistic processes 1'],2025-01-14
Testing $\gamma\delta$CDM Model in the Redshift Bins,"The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe, being of the order 5$\sigma$. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current cosmological model, indicating unknown new physics, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations. In this work, we investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble constant in the $\gamma\delta$CDM cosmological model, which is a new cosmological model based on $f(R)$ gravity in an anisotropic background. Through data analysis with the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, the cosmic chronometers Hubble, and both the old and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation data, we establish that the Hubble constant in our model does not evolve with redshift. We also confirm that our model fits the aforementioned data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model by checking various information criteria. The value of the Hubble constant obtained in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is in the 1$\sigma$ bound of the late Universe observations.","['Furkan Şakir Dilsiz', 'Cemsinan Deliduman', 'Selinay Sude Binici']",14.0,26.0,6.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07538,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-01-14
Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport,"Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.","['Evan Grohs', 'Sherwood Richers', 'Julien Froustey', 'Francois Foucart', 'James P.

"Compact Size, High $\Sigma$SFR: Defining Morphological Features of Ly$\alpha$-Emitters","The mechanisms of Ly$\alpha$ photon escape are key to understanding galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization, yet remain poorly understood. We investigate the UV-continuum sizes of 23 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at Cosmic Noon ($1.7 < z < 3.3$), extending previous size analyses to include fainter galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -14$) using gravitational lensing. Our results show that these LAEs are unusually small for their luminosity, with a mean effective radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of $170 \pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct size-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$ approximately three times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar redshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift Green Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across redshifts. We also find that Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)) increases with decreasing $r_{\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The small sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR $= 1-600 M_{\sun} \ \rm{yr}^{-1} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), clearly separating them from typical SFGs in the $\Sigma$SFR vs. $r_{\rm eff}$ space. Given that high $\Sigma$SFR is linked to strong galactic outflows, our findings imply that compact morphology plays a key role in Ly$\alpha$ escape, likely facilitated by outflows that clear under-dense channels in the ISM. Thus, these results demonstrate that compact size and high $\Sigma$SFR can help identify Ly$\alpha$-emitters.","['Keunho Kim', 'Anahita Alavi', 'Christopher Snapp-Kolas', 'Brian Siana', 'Johan Richard', 'Harry Teplitz', 'James Colbert', 'Vihang Mehta', 'Ana Paulino-Afonso', 'Eros Vanzella']",5.0,11.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07548,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,[],2025-01-14
Euclid: Optimising tomographic redshift binning for 3$\times$2pt power spectrum constraints on dark energy,"We present a simulation-based method to explore the optimum tomographic redshift binning strategy for 3x2pt analyses with Euclid, focusing on the expected configuration of its first major data release (DR1). To do this, we 1) simulate a Euclid-like observation and generate mock shear catalogues from multiple realisations of the 3x2pt fields on the sky, and 2) measure the 3x2pt Pseudo-Cl power spectra for a given tomographic configuration and derive the constraints that they place on the standard dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). For a simulation including Gaussian-distributed photometric redshift uncertainty and shape noise under a LambdaCDM cosmology, we find that bins equipopulated with galaxies yield the best constraints on (w0, wa) for an analysis of the full 3x2pt signal, or the angular clustering component only. For the cosmic shear component, the optimum (w0, wa) constraints are achieved by bins equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance. However, the advantage with respect to alternative binning choices is only a few percent in the size of the $1\,\sigma\,$(w0, wa) contour, and we conclude that the cosmic shear is relatively insensitive to the binning methodology. We find that the information gain extracted on (w0, wa) for any 3x2pt component starts to saturate at $\gtrsim$ 7-8 bins. Any marginal gains resulting from a greater number of bins is likely to be limited by additional uncertainties present in a real measurement, and the increasing demand for accuracy of the covariance matrix. Finally, we consider a 5% contamination from catastrophic photometric redshift outliers and find that, if these errors are not mitigated in the analysis, the bias induced in the 3x2pt signal for 10 equipopulated bins results in dark energy constraints that are inconsistent with the fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology at $>5\,\sigma$.","['J.

A reference framework for extremely metal-poor OB star studies: calibrations for stellar parameters and intrinsic colours,"We provide the first reference framework for extremely metal-poor (XMP) OB-type stars. We parsed a grid of 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ FASTWIND models, covering the parameter space of O stars and early-B supergiants, through contemporary spectral classification criteria to deliver a calibration of key stellar properties as a function of spectral type, and tabulated colours for the most common photometric systems. By using an extensive grid of models, we account for the different combinations of stellar parameters that result in the same spectral morphology and provide a range of parameters and colours compatible with each spectral subtype and luminosity class. We supply updated photometric criteria to optimize candidate selection of OB stars in XMP environments. We find 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ OB stars are 1-6 kK hotter and produce higher ionizing fluxes than their Galactic analogues. In addition, we find a bimodal distribution of the HeII-ionizing flux with spectral type; because of its known dependence on effective temperature and the wind, $\log~q_{HeII}$ for individual XMP late-O type stars could be underestimated by up to 4 orders of magnitude by other calibrations, some of them used by population synthesis codes. Finally, we used our calibrated colours to map the extinction of the 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ galaxy Sextans A finding that reddening is non-negligible and uneven.","['Marta Lorenzo', 'Miriam Garcia', 'Norberto Castro', 'Francisco Najarro', 'Miguel Cerviño', 'Artemio Herrero', 'Sergio Simón-Díaz']",23.0,26.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07569,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,"['stars:massive–stars:early-type–stars:evolution–stars:fundamentalparameters–stars:PopulationIII–galaxies: individual: Sextans A 1 INTRODUCTION In a Universe whose average metal content has been ever-growing sincetheBigBang', 'defined as≤0', 'thestudyofextremelymetal-poor(XMP']",2025-01-14
The Guitar's Magnetic Field Revealed by Starlight Polarization,The Guitar nebula surrounding PSR B2224+65 boasts a pulsar X-ray filament likely aligned with the local magnetic field. We present new RoboPol stellar polarization data distributed along the line-of-sight to the pulsar. The polarizing effect of intervening magnetized dust allows us to extract a model for the dust-weighted magnetic field. We detect a magnetic field angle consistent with the filament if the pulsar is located in the more distant zone of its parallax-estimated distance range.,"['Jack T. Dinsmore', 'Roger W.

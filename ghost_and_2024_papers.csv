Neutron star evolution by combining discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume methods,"We present here a new hybrid scheme that combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.","['Ananya Adhikari', 'Wolfgang Tichy', 'Liwei Ji', 'Amit Poudel']",20.0,34.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07204,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,[],2025-02-12,Ghost/Extra (Not in Pure List)
The Luminosity of the Darkness: Schechter function in dark sirens,"Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a novel avenue for probing the Universe. One of their exciting applications is the independent measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, using dark standard sirens, which combine GW signals with galaxy catalogues considering that GW events are hosted by galaxies. However, due to the limited reach of telescopes, galaxy catalogues are incomplete at high redshifts. The commonly used GLADE+ is complete only up to redshift $z=0.1$, necessitating a model accounting for the galaxy luminosity distribution accounting for the selection function of galaxies, typically described by the Schechter function. In this paper, we examine the influence of the Schechter function model on dark sirens, focusing on its redshift evolution and its impact on $H_0$ and rate parameters measurements. We find that neglecting the evolution of the Schechter function can influence the prior in redshift on GWs, which has particularly high impact for distant GW events with limited galaxy catalogue support. Moreover, conducting a joint estimation of $H_0$ and the rate parameters, we find that allowing them to vary fixes the bias in $H_0$ but the rate parameter $\gamma$ depends on the evolving Schechter function. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolving Schechter function to account for changes in galaxy populations over cosmic time, as this impacts rate parameters to which $H_0$ is sensitive.","['Cezary Turski', 'Maria Lisa Brozzetti', 'Gergely Dálya', 'Michele Punturo', 'Archisman Ghosh']",9.0,8.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13568,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology'],,,"['gravitational waves – cosmological parameters – galaxies: luminosity function', 'mass function 1 INTRODUCTION Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is a novel way of probing the Universe']",2025-05-21,Duplicate
Forward vs Backward: Improving BAO Constraints with Field-Level Inference,"We present results of field-level inference of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale $r_s$ on rest-frame dark matter halo catalogs. Our field-level constraint on $r_s$ is obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with the bias and noise parameters via the LEFTfield EFT-based forward model. Comparing with a standard reconstruction pipeline applied to the same data and over the same scales, the field-level constraint on the BAO scale improves by a factor of $\sim 1.2-1.4$ over standard BAO reconstruction. We point to a surprisingly simple source of the additional information.","['Ivana Babić', 'Fabian Schmidt', 'Beatriz Tucci']",8.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13588,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Distinguishing the origin of eccentric black-hole mergers with gravitational-wave spin measurements,"It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim40\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim80\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.","['Jakob Stegmann', 'Davide Gerosa', 'Isobel Romero-Shaw', 'Giulia Fumagalli', 'Hiromichi Tagawa', 'Lorenz Zwick']",7.0,11.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13589,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics', 'General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']",,,[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Formation and evolution of boxy/peanut bulges in the Auriga cosmological simulations,"Boxy/peanut (b/p) or X-shaped bulges have been extensively explored with theory and numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. However, it is only recently that advances in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have made it possible to explore b/p bulges in a cosmological setting, with much remaining to be understood about their formation and evolution. By using the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we characterise the structural parameters of b/p bulges and how they form and evolve throughout cosmic history. We develop a method for estimating the b/p strength that allows us to identify the formation time and size of these structures. We find that b/p bulges in Auriga form between $\sim 1.1-1.6\, \mathrm Gyr$ after bar formation, following a `buckling' episode; some galaxies undergo multiple bucklings and events of b/p growth, with some b/p structures `dissolving' between buckling events. We find that at $z=0$, the b/p bulges have an extent of almost half the bar length. Finally, we analyse the evolution of the b/p fraction over redshift, finding that at $z=0$, two thirds of galaxies host a bar, and of these, $45$ per cent have a b/p. This b/p fraction is within the observed range at $z=0$, although on the low end as compared to some observational studies. The b/p fraction decreases to $20$ per cent at $z=0.5$, and falls to zero at $z \sim 1$; this is in line with the observed trend of declining b/p fraction with redshift. We discuss possible culprits for the apparent mismatch in b/p occurrence between observations and cosmological simulations, what causes them to form (or not) in these simulations, and what this might reveal about models of galaxy formation and evolution.","['Paula D.

Modeling Galaxy Surveys with Hybrid SBI,"Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the computational cost of running simulations that can describe the increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory (PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses, thus demonstrating the efficacy of this approach to maximally extract information from upcoming spectroscopic datasets.","['Gemma Zhang', 'Chirag Modi', 'Oliver H.

The High-redshift Blazar MG3 J163554+3629: Physical Properties and the Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth,"There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter. Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3 J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1) x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid growth.","['Jose Maria Sanchez Zaballa', 'Eugenio Bottacini', 'Andrea Tramacere']",4.0,13.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13593,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['Flat-spectrum radio quasars: individual: MG3 J163554 +3629 – Active galactic nuclei – High- redshift galaxies – Supermassive black holes 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2255. I. Insights from deep LOFAR-VLBI sub-arcsecond resolution images,"High sensitivity of modern interferometers is revealing a plethora of filaments surrounding radio galaxies, especially in galaxy cluster environments. The morphology and spectral characteristics of these thin structures require the combination of high-resolution and low frequency observations, which is best obtained using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) international stations. In this paper, we aim to detect and characterize non-thermal filaments observed close or as part of the radio galaxies in Abell 2255 using deep, LOFAR-VLBI observations at 144 MHz. These structures can be used to disentangle possible scenarios for the origin of the non-thermal filaments and connection to the motion of the host galaxy within the dense and turbulent intracluster medium (ICM), and consequent interaction between the ICM and radio jets. Combining multiple observations, we produced the deepest images ever obtained with LOFAR-VLBI targeting a galaxy cluster, using 56 hours of observations, reaching $0.3-0.5""$ resolution. We detailed throughout the paper the calibration and imaging strategy for the different targets, as well as the multitude of morphological features discovered. Thanks to the high-sensitivity of LOFAR-VLBI, we revealed unprecedented details for the main cluster radio galaxies, recovering in most cases also their more extended structure observed only at such low frequencies. In particular, we focused on the Original Tailed Radio Galaxy (Original TRG) where we distinguished many filaments constituting its tail with varying lengths ($80-110$ kpc) and widths ($3-10$ kpc). The final radio images showcase the potential of deep, high-resolution observations for galaxy clusters. With such approach, we enabled the study of these thin, elongated radio filaments: after being discovered, these filaments now require spectral studies to determine their formation mechanisms.","['E.

FAUST XXIV. Large dust grains in the protostellar outflow cavity walls of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5,"Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.","['G. Sabatini', 'E. Bianchi', 'C. J. Chandler', 'L. Cacciapuoti', 'L. Podio', 'M. J.

Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium properties and observables,"Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc) CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering, motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant and could be used as a framework for future studies.","['Yue Samuel Lu', 'Dušan Kereš', 'Philip F.

"A Panchromatic Characterization of the Evening and Morning Atmosphere of WASP-107 b: Composition and Cloud Variations, and Insight into the Effect of Stellar Contamination","Limb-resolved transmission spectroscopy has the potential to transform our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres. By separately measuring the transmission spectra of the evening and morning limbs, these atmospheric regions can be individually characterized, shedding light into the global distribution and transport of key atmospheric properties from transit observations alone. In this work, we follow up the recent detection of limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107 b (Murphy et al. 2024) by reanalyzing literature observations of WASP-107 b using all of JWST's science intruments (NIRISS, NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI) to measure its limb transmission spectra from $\sim$1-12 $\mu$m. We confirm the evening--morning temperature difference inferred previously and find that it is qualitatively consistent with predictions from global circulation models. We find evidence for evening--morning variation in SO$_2$ and CO$_2$ abundance, and significant cloud coverage only on WASP-107 b's morning limb. We find that the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations are potentially contaminated by occulted starspots, which we leverage to investigate stellar contamination's impact on limb asymmetry measurements. We find that starspot crossings can significantly bias the inferred evening and morning transmission spectra depending on when they occur during the transit, and develop a simple correction model which successfully brings these instruments' spectra into agreement with the uncontaminated observations.","['Matthew M.

Determining the origin of the X-ray emission in blazars through multiwavelength polarization,"The origin of the high-energy emission in astrophysical jets from black holes is a highly debated issue. This is particularly true for jets from supermassive black holes that are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. So far, the addition of new observations and new messengers have only managed to create more questions than answers. However, the newly available X-ray polarization observations promise to finally distinguish between emission models. We use extensive multiwavelength and polarization campaigns as well as state-of-the-art polarized spectral energy distribution models to attack this problem by focusing on two X-ray polarization observations of blazar BL Lacertae in flaring and quiescent $\gamma$-ray states. We find that regardless of the jet composition and underlying emission model, inverse-Compton scattering from relativistic electrons dominates at X-ray energies.","['Ioannis Liodakis', 'Haocheng Zhang', 'Stella Boula', 'Riccardo Middei', 'Jorge Otero-Santos', 'Dmitry Blinov', 'Iván Agudo', 'Markus Böttcher', 'Chien-Ting Chen', 'Steven R.

Deep galaxy stellar mass functions as a function of star formation rate in the Virgo cluster environment,"We analyze deep ($M_*\gtrsim10^7~{M}_{\odot}$) galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) of the Virgo cluster using stellar masses derived as part of the Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS). The total SMF has a slope of $\alpha=-1.35^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ which is similar to or steeper than typical field values. Using deep \ha{} data from the Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) we separate out star-forming galaxies, quiescent galaxies with no ongoing star formation, and low-SFR galaxies that are intermediate between these two populations. For each of these populations, the shape of the SMF is found to be universal throughout the cluster, from the core to the outskirts. The star-forming and quiescent SMFs show stark differences with values seen in field galaxies. The relative fraction of quiescent galaxies is highest in the core of the cluster, with low-SFR and star-forming galaxies more significant in the outer regions of the cluster. At low stellar masses ($M_*\lesssim10^9~{M}_{\odot}$), the quiescent fraction in the main cluster is significantly higher than that of the field and even satellites of massive groups. At high stellar masses, the quiescent fraction is similar to other studies of cluster galaxies. We model the quiescent population in the infall region of the cluster as a combination of backsplash and field quiescent galaxies, and find that the backsplash fractions needed to explain the observed population are unrealistically high. This suggests the existence of a third population of low-mass galaxies that are pre-processed outside the virial radius of the cluster, possibly in groups prior to infall.","['Cameron R.

Large databases of metal-poor stars corrected for three-dimensional and/or non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects,"Early chemical enrichment processes can be revealed by the careful study of metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances. Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]<-3.5, models are unable to reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous environments at higher redshift.","['I.

INSPIRE: INvestigating Stellar Populations In RElics. IX. KiDS J0842+0059: the first fully confirmed relic beyond the local Universe,"Relics are massive, compact and quiescent galaxies that assembled the majority of their stars in the early Universe and lived untouched until today, completely missing any subsequent size-growth caused by mergers and interactions. They provide the unique opportunity to put constraints on the first phase of mass assembly in the Universe with the ease of being nearby. While only a few relics have been found in the local Universe, the {\tt INSPIRE} project has confirmed 38 relics at higher redshifts ($z \sim 0.2-0.4$), fully characterising their integrated kinematics and stellar populations. However, given the very small sizes of these objects and the limitations imposed by the atmosphere, structural parameters inferred from ground-based optical imaging are possibly affected by systematic effects that are difficult to quantify. In this paper, we present the first high-resolution image obtained with Adaptive Optics Ks-band observations on SOUL-LUCI@LBT of one of the most extreme {\tt INSPIRE} relics, KiDS~J0842+0059 at $z \sim 0.3$. We confirm the disky morphology of this galaxy (axis ratio of $0.24$) and its compact nature (circularized effective radius of $\sim 1$ kpc) by modelling its 2D surface brightness profile with a PSF-convolved Sérsic model. We demonstrate that the surface mass density profile of KiDS~J0842+0059 closely resembles that of the most extreme local relic, NGC~1277, as well as of high-redshift red nuggets. We unambiguously conclude that this object is a remnant of a high-redshift compact and massive galaxy, which assembled all of its mass at $z>2$, and completely missed the merger phase of the galaxy evolution.","['C.

Distinguishing Distance Duality breaking models using electromagnetic and gravitational waves measurements,"Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology. We explore the role of upcoming gravitational wave observations in investigating possible deviations from the distance duality relation, alongside the more commonly used supernovae. We find that, when combined with baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational waves will provide similar constraining power to the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae. Moreover, the combination of observables with different sensitivities to electromagnetic and gravitational physics provides a promising way to discriminate among different physical mechanisms that could lead to violations of the distance duality relation.","['Chiara De Leo', 'Matteo Martinelli', ""Rocco D'Agostino"", 'Giulia Gianfagna', 'Carlos J.

In addition to flux-density measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest redshift acquired (so far) being z ~ 2.2 from SDSS, we look forward to evolution studies of this complete sample, as well as breaking degeneracies in radio properties with respect to, for example, the galaxy environment.","['Sarah V.

Field-Level Comparison and Robustness Analysis of Cosmological N-Body Simulations,"We present the first field-level comparison of cosmological N-body simulations, considering various widely used codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Enzo, Gadget, Gizmo, PKDGrav, and Ramses. Unlike previous comparisons focused on summary statistics, we conduct a comprehensive field-level analysis: evaluating statistical similarity, quantifying implications for cosmological parameter inference, and identifying the regimes in which simulations are consistent. We begin with a traditional comparison using the power spectrum, cross-correlation coefficient, and visual inspection of the matter field. We follow this with a statistical out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis to quantify distributional differences between simulations, revealing insights not captured by the traditional metrics. We then perform field-level simulation-based inference (SBI) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), training on one simulation and testing on others, including a full hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. We identify several causes of OOD behavior and biased inference, finding that resolution effects, such as those arising from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), have a significant impact. Models trained on non-AMR simulations fail catastrophically when evaluated on AMR simulations, introducing larger biases than those from hydrodynamic effects. Differences in resolution, even when using the same N-body code, likewise lead to biased inference. We attribute these failures to a CNN's sensitivity to small-scale fluctuations, particularly in voids and filaments, and demonstrate that appropriate smoothing brings the simulations into statistical agreement. Our findings motivate the need for careful data filtering and the use of field-level OOD metrics, such as PQMass, to ensure robust inference.","['Adrian E.

Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary Gravitational Waves,"In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}<1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}>1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.","['Subhasis Maiti', 'Debaprasad Maity', 'Rohan Srikanth']",5.0,24.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13623,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,['High Energy Physics - Phenomenology'],,,[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35,"We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind to explain the 16000 km s$^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.","['Sean J.

Mass of Cepheid V350 Sgr Incorporating Interferometry and the Companion Mass,"The system V350 Sgr has a classical Cepheid for the primary. Interferometry is presented for the system and the full orbit is determined. The mass of the companion has been determined from an {\it IUE} spectrum and comparison with the mass-temperature relation from Detached Eclipsing Binaries. Combined with the mass of the companion (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2 M$_\odot$), the mass of the Cepheid is determined to be 4.7 $\pm$ 0.8 M$_\odot$. For systems with less complete information, Cepheid masses can be determined from a single-lined spectroscopic orbit, {\it Gaia} proper motion anomalies, and the mass of the companion from the ultraviolet.

UGC 10043 in Depth: Dissecting the Polar Bulge and Subtle LSB Features,"Galaxies with polar structures -- of which polar-ring galaxies (PRGs) are a prominent subclass -- contain components that are kinematically decoupled and highly inclined relative to the host galaxy's major axis. Modern deep optical surveys provide a powerful means of detecting low surface brightness (LSB) features around galaxies, offering critical insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies with polar structures. UGC 10043 is an edge-on galaxy notable for its prominent bulge, which extends orthogonally to the disk plane. In addition, the galaxy displays a well-defined integral-shaped disk warp and multiple dust features crossing the bulge along the minor galaxy axis. In this work, we present new deep optical photometry of UGC 10043 down to 29.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and perform a detailed analysis of its LSB and polar structures. The observations reveal a stellar stream aligned along the polar axis, alongside other signatures of tidal interaction, including a flat, tilted LSB envelope that extends toward the neighboring galaxy MCG +04-37-035, with which UGC 10043 is connected by an HI bridge. Our results suggest that the polar component of UGC 10043 comprises and older, triaxial polar bulge and a younger, forming polar structure, likely originating from the ongoing disruption of a dwarf satellite galaxy, while also participating in active interaction with MCG +04-37-035.","['S.

Oort Cloud Ecology. III. The Sun left the parent star cluster shortly after the giant planets formed,"The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e < 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 < a < 10^4$\,au) objects.","['Simon Portegies Zwart', 'Shuo Huang']",7.0,9.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13666,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"['Astrophysics of Galaxies', 'Solar and Stellar Astrophysics']",A&A,"A&A 698, L27 (2025)",[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Multipole Analysis and Application to Supernova Remnant X-ray Images,"We develop a multipole analysis method for images with a circular boundary, then apply it to supernova remnant (SNR) images.

The current multipole method corrects some errors in a previously presented method, and applies the new analysis to test for differences in X-ray image morphology between Type Ia and core-collapse type SNRs. We find there is no clear difference between the two SNR types in morphology as measured by multipole moments.","['Denis A. Leahy', 'S. Ranasinghe', 'J. Hansen', 'M.D. Filipović', 'Z.

Unveiling Electron Density Profile in Nearby Galaxies using SDSS MaNGA,"Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 Å~and [O\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726, 3729 Å\ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their distribution in the galaxies, we employ Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations from the SDSS Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, utilising data products from both the \texttt{Pipe3D} and MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $13$ face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 10^\circ$), including $9$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and $4$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$ are obtained using two different binning schemes: linear and non-linear. For the \texttt{Pipe3D} case, both SFGs and non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with higher densities of $n_e$(S\,\textsc{ii}) = $165.6 \pm 20.8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decrease to $31 \pm 4.5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $>$ 1.5). We also translate $n_e$ to the electron column density $N_e$ assuming an evenly distributed thin disk profile, fairly excluding the central bulge regions. These electron density estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.","['Shivam Burman', 'Sunil Malik', 'Suprit Singh', 'Yogesh Wadadekar']",8.0,15.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13677,Astrophysics of Galaxies,['Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics'],,,['galaxies: evolution - galaxies: ISM - galaxies: star formation - ISM: evolution - ISM: H II regions - techniques: spectroscopic - methods: statistical 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Sub-Neptune Exoplanet Hazes Through Laboratory Experiments,"Temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets could contain large inventories of water in various phases, such as water-worlds with water-rich atmospheres or even oceans. Both space-based and ground-based observations have shown that many exoplanets likely also contain photochemically-generated hazes. Haze particles are a key source of organic matter and may impact the evolution or origin of life. In addition, haze layers could provide a mechanism for lower-atmospheric shielding and ultimately atmospheric retention. Often orbiting close to M-dwarf stars, these planets receive large amounts of radiation, especially during flaring events, which may strip away their atmospheres. M-dwarf stars are known to have higher stellar activity than other types of stars, and stellar flares have the potential to accelerate atmospheric escape. In this work, we present results on laboratory investigations of UV radiation effects simulating two different stellar flare energies on laboratory-produced exoplanet hazes made under conditions analogous to water-world atmospheres. We find that both simulated flares altered the overall transmittance and reflectance of the hazes, and higher energy ""flares"" make those alterations more pronounced. On a larger scale, these laboratory-made hazes show potential signs of degradation over the simulated flaring period. Our results provide insight into the effects that stellar flaring events have on potential exoplanet haze composition and the ability for water-world-like exoplanets to retain their atmospheres.","['Lori Huseby', 'Sarah E.

New insight into the variability of the Be star $π$ Aquarii: Determination of stellar and disk parameters,"The Be star $\pi$ Aquarii shows peculiar $\gamma$ Cas-type X-ray emission, likely caused by its outer disk interacting with a low-mass companion, probably a white dwarf. We study the long-term variability of its optical spectra to derive stellar and disk parameters during major changes. We identify and analyze Balmer, helium, silicon, and iron emission lines at selected epochs. Stellar parameters were derived using atmosphere models, considering oblate geometry due to fast rotation. Disk properties were constrained through H$\alpha$ line modeling using a viscous decretion disk model. The H$\alpha$ line evolved from shell to double-, triple-peaked, and flat-topped profiles. On Dec 22, 2001, the disk showed a low-intensity shell profile and fast density decay, indicating a small disk. From 2011 to 2014, the disk decayed slowly, then grew significantly until Nov 2022, increasing its H$\alpha$ equivalent width 18-fold and reaching an emitting region of ~65 solar radii. The inclination changed by ~10 degrees over 20 years, suggesting a precessing disk. The FeII 5018 A line traces a larger region than H$\alpha$ and is the only FeII line with a distinct profile. We conclude $\pi$ Aquarii is part of a misaligned binary system, with the white dwarf crossing the disk twice per orbit, capturing material, and enhancing X-ray emission.","['D. Concha', 'C.

The plunging region of a thin accretion disc around a Schwarzschild black hole,"A set of analytic solutions for the plunging region thermodynamics have been developed recently under the assumption that the fluid undergoes a gravity-dominated geodesic plunge into the black hole. We test this model against a dedicated 3D global GRMHD simulation of a thin accretion disc around a Schwarzschild black hole using the code AthenaK. Provided that we account for non-adiabatic heating in the energetics, plausibly from grid-scale magnetic dissipation, we find an excellent agreement between the analytic model and the simulated quantities. These results are particularly important for existing and future electromagnetic black hole spin measurements, many of which do not to include the plunging fluid in their emission modelling. This exclusion typically stems from the assumption of a zero-stress boundary condition at the ISCO, forcing all thermodynamic quantities to vanish. Instead, we find a non-zero $\delta_\mathcal{J}\approx 5.3 \%$ drop in the angular momentum over the plunging region, which is consistent with both prior simulations and observations. We demonstrate that this stress is small enough for the dynamics of the fluid in the plunging region to be well-described by geodesic trajectories, yet large enough to cause measurable dissipation near to the ISCO - keeping thermodynamic quantities from vanishing. In the plunging region, constant $\alpha$-disc models are a physically inappropriate framework.","['Jake Rule', 'Andrew Mummery', 'Steven Balbus', 'James Stone', 'Lizhong Zhang']",9.0,13.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13701,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,,,,"['accretion', 'accretion discs — black hole physics 1 INTRODUCTION From the supermassive black holes at the center of Active Galactic NucleitothestellarmassblackholesfoundinX-raybinarysystems', 'disc accretion of matter onto black holes is a prominent source of powerintheUniverse']",2025-05-21,Duplicate
Can thermodynamic equilibrium be established in planet-forming disks?,"The inner regions of planet-forming disks are warm and dense. The chemical networks used for disk modelling so far were developed for a cold and dilute medium and do not include a complete set of pressure-dependent reactions. The chemical networks developed for planetary atmospheres include such reactions along with the inverse reactions related to the Gibb's free energies of the molecules. The chemical networks used for disk modelling are thus incomplete in this respect. We want to study whether thermodynamic equilibrium can be established in a planet-forming disk. We identify the regions in the disk most likely to reach thermodynamic equilibrium and determine the timescale over which this occurs. We employ the theoretical concepts used in exoplanet atmosphere chemistry for the disk modelling with PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel ({\sc ProDiMo}). We develop a chemical network called CHemistry Assembled from exoplanets and dIsks for Thermodynamic EquilibriA ({\sc ChaiTea}) that is based on the UMIST 2022, STAND, and large DIscANAlysis (DIANA) chemical networks. It consists of 239 species. From the STAND network, we adopt the concept of reversing all gas-phase reactions based on thermodynamic data. We use single-point models for a range of gas densities and gas temperatures to verify that the implemented concepts work and thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in the absence of cosmic rays and photoreactions including radiative associations and direct recombinations. We then study the impact of photoreactions and cosmic rays that lead to deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium. We explore the chemical relaxation timescales towards thermodynamic equilibrium.

CHANG-ES: XXXVI. The thin and thick radio discs,"Context. Edge-on spiral galaxies give us an outsiders' view of the radio halo, which envelops these galaxies. The radio halos are caused by extra-planar cosmic-ray electrons that emit synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. Aims. We aim to study the origin of radio halos around galaxies and infer the role of cosmic-rays in supporting the gaseous discs. We would like to test the influence of star formation as the main source of cosmic rays as well as other fundamental galaxy properties such as mass and size. Methods. We present a study of radio continuum scale heights in 22 nearby edge-on galaxies from the CHANG-ES survey. We employ deep observations with the Jansky Very Large Array in the S-band (2-4 GHz), imaging at 7"" angular resolution. We measure scale heights in three strips within the effective radio continuum radius, correcting for the influence of angular resolution and inclination angle. We include only galaxies where a distinction between the two disc components can be made in at least one of the strips, providing us with robust measurements of both scale heights. Results. We find a strong positive correlation between scale heights of the thin and thick discs and star-forming radius as well as star-formation rate (SFR); moderately strong correlations are found for the mass surface density and the ratio of SFR-to-mass surface density; no correlation is found with SFR surface density alone. Yet the SFR surface density plays a role as well: galaxies with high SFR surface densities have a rather roundish shape, whereas galaxies with little star formation show only a relatively small vertical extent in comparison to their size.

Detection of Hydrocarbons in the Disk around an Actively-Accreting Planetary-Mass Object,"We present the 0.6--12-micron spectrum of Cha\,1107-7626, a 6-10 Jupiter-mass free-floating object in the $\sim$2\,Myr-old Chamaeleon-I star-forming region, from observations with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We confirm that Cha\,1107-7626 is one of the lowest-mass objects known to harbor a dusty disk with infrared excess emission at wavelengths beyond 4 microns. Our NIRSpec data, and prior ground-based observations, provide strong evidence for ongoing accretion through Hydrogen recombination lines. In the mid-infrared spectrum, we detect unambiguously emission lines caused by methane (CH$_\mathrm{4}$) and ethylene (C$_\mathrm{2}$H$_\mathrm{4}$) in its circum-substellar disk. Our findings mean that Cha 1107-7626 is by far the lowest-mass object with hydrocarbons observed in its disk. The spectrum of the disk looks remarkably similar to that of ISO-ChaI 147, a very low mass star with a carbon-rich disk that is 10 to 20 times more massive than Cha\,1107-7626. The hydrocarbon lines can be accounted for with a model assuming gas temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin in the inner disk. The obvious similarities between the spectra of a low-mass star and a planetary-mass object indicate that the conditions in the inner disks can be similar across a wide range of central object masses.","['Laura Flagg', 'Aleks Scholz', 'V.

Quantifying Chromosphere Response to Flare Energy Release Using AIA Observations in 1600~Å and 304~Å Passbands,"Imaging observations of the solar lower atmosphere by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly (AIA) have been mostly used as the context, and their quantitative information has been much less explored. The chromosphere responds rapidly to energy release by magnetic reconnection during flares. Furthermore, a flare is a collection of multiple energy release events that can be identified in spatially resolved chromosphere observations. In this paper, we conduct a statistical and semi-quantitative study of the relative photometry in the UV 1600~Å and EUV 304~Å passbands for 18 flares observed by AIA. In each flare, we have identified thousands of flare ribbon pixels in the UV 1600~Å images, and measured their brightness (counts per second) and the rise and decay timescales, which are indicative of heating properties in flare loops. The analysis shows that bright flare pixels, characterized by peak brightness larger than ten times the quiescent brightness, exhibit sharp light curves with the half rise time below 2 min, followed by a two-phase decay with a rapid decay on timescales comparable to the rise time and then a more gradual decay. Flare ribbon pixels identified in both UV 1600 ~Å and EUV 304~Å images exhibit similar time profiles during the rise, and their peak brightness appear to be related by a power law. Our analysis shows that AIA observed flare brightness in UV 1600~Å relative to the quiescent brightness is a meaningful measurement of the flare chromosphere photometry, and AIA observations for over a decade thus provide a unique and extensive database for systematic and semi-quantitative study of flaring chromosphere, either in the context of the Sun as a star, or in spatially resolved manner that helps to probe the nature of flare energy release on elementary scales.","['Jiong Qiu', 'Rhiannon Fleming']",13.0,32.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13728,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,"['USA SOLA: ms_sp', 'Bozeman', 'EUV', 'Montana State University', 'Corona', 'Magnetic Reconnection', '59717', 'Chromosphere', 'Solar Flares', 'UV 1Department of Physics', 'MT']",2025-05-21,Duplicate
XRISM Reveals a Remnant Torus in the Low-Luminosity AGN M81*,"Up to 40% of galaxies in the local universe host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak, neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and K$_{\alpha,2}$ components.

The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss, assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical significance.

We use the spectra to refine the velocities and physical properties to 6706 \higal\ clumps located in the OGHReS region. In a previous paper, we analysed 3584 clumps between $\ell = 250^\circ$ and $280^\circ$.

Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-I. A high-accuracy model for von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations,"Triple systems with low hierarchical structure are common throughout the Universe, including examples such as high-altitude lunar satellites influenced by the Earth, planetary satellites perturbed by the Sun, and stellar binaries affected by a supermassive black hole. In these systems, nonlinear perturbations are significant, making classical double-averaged models (even those incorporating the Brown Hamiltonian correction) insufficient for accurately capturing long-term dynamics. To overcome this limitation, the current study develops a high-precision dynamical model that incorporates the nonlinear effects of the quadrupole-order potential arising from both the inner and outer bodies, referred to as the extended Brown Hamiltonian model. This framework specifically expresses the Hamiltonian function and the transformation between mean and osculating orbital elements in elegant, closed forms with respect to the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. Practical applications to Jupiter's irregular satellites show that the long-term evolutions predicted by the extended Brown Hamiltonian model align well with the results of direct N-body simulations. The developed Hamiltonian offers a fundamental dynamical model, which is particularly well suited for describing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in low-hierarchy three-body systems.","['Hanlun Lei', 'Evgeni Grishin']",5.0,12.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13780,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,MNRAS,,"['the eccentricity and inclination of the inner orbit undergo coupled evolution due to the long-term pertur- bation from a distant body', 'celestial mechanics – planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability – planetary systems 1 INTRODUCTION In hierarchical triple systems']",2025-05-21,Duplicate
Statistical Properties of Predicted Blended Eclipsing Binary False Positives in PLATO LOPS,"With the planned launch of the PLAnetary Transit and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) satellite mission in 2026, an understanding of the stellar properties and spatial distribution of astrophysical false positives (FPs) is essential to ensure the limited ground-based spectroscopy resources are used efficiently to target the most likely genuine planetary transit (PT) candidates. In our previous paper, Bray et al. (2023), we presented the expected blended eclipsing binary false positive (BEB) percentage in the proposed Southern PLATO field, which we referred to as SPF0. This was obtained from a detailed statistical analysis of a complete synthetic rendering of SPF0.

Galaxy And Mass Assembly: A new approach to quantifying dust in galaxies,"We introduce a new approach to quantifying dust in galaxies by combining information from the Balmer decrement (BD) and the dust mass ($M_d$). While there is no explicit correlation between these two properties, they jointly probe different aspects of the dust present in galaxies. We explore two new parameters that link BD with $M_d$ by using star formation rate sensitive luminosities at several wavelengths (ultraviolet, H$\alpha$, and far-infrared). This analysis shows that combining the BD and $M_d$ in these ways provides new metrics that are sensitive to the degree of optically thick dust affecting the short wavelength emission. We show how these new ''dust geometry'' parameters vary as a function of galaxy mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate. We demonstrate that they are sensitive probes of the dust geometry in galaxies, and that they support the ''maximal foreground screen'' model for dust in starburst galaxies.","['B. Farley', 'U. T.

TransFit: An Efficient Framework for Transient Light-Curve Fitting with Time-Dependent Radiative Diffusion,"Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semi-analytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. This paper introduces TransFit, a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on light curve morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to $^{56}$Ni}-powered light curves. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast datasets of current and future transient surveys.","['Liang-Duan Liu', 'Yu-Hao Zhang', 'Yun-Wei Yu', 'Ze-Xin Du', 'Jing-Yao Li', 'Guang-Lei Wu', 'Zi-Gao Dai']",12.0,24.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13825,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['Supernovae (1668)'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Pulsar Cyclic Spectroscopy in the Partial-Deconvolution Regime: Benefits & Limitations,"We explore possible advantages of cyclic spectroscopy for observations of pulsars in instances where full cyclic deconvolution is not feasible. We compute cyclic merits and full-deconvolution regime boundaries for pulsars observed by NANOGrav and discuss which sources stand to benefit the most from using cyclic spectroscopy when observed with the Green Bank Telescope and DSA-2000 in a given frequency range. We compare data products, namely the wavefield, in both full-deconvolution and partial-deconvolution regimes to demonstrate what can be accomplished with incomplete phase retrieval. Additionally, we show how some phase retrieval can still be achieved in the partial-deconvolution regime and how this allows for additional information in scintillation-based data products, like the dynamic wavefield power, compared to what can be found in traditional dynamic spectra. An examination of dynamic wavefield phase as a function of observing frequency reveals more complete phase retrieval is achieved the closer one gets to the full deconvolution regime, agreeing with the expectations of cyclic merit. While we demonstrate that fragmentary recovery of the secondary wavefield can be accomplished in the partial-deconvolution regime, we advocate for a synergistic approach with phase retrieval methods like the $\theta-\theta$ transform, although we also provide discussion about shortcomings of this strategy. Finally, we use the combination of modest cyclic merit and lack of discernible results for PSR J1903$+$0327 to motivate the creation of an updated ""cyclic merit 2.0"", which relies on scintillation bandwidth instead of observing bandwidth.","['Jacob E.

Oscillatory magnetic reconnection at a coronal bright point,"Coronal bright points are typical small-scale coronal brightenings that consist of a bundle of miniature coronal loops. Using the ultra-high-resolution coronal images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Image onboard Solar Obiter, we report the first observational evidence of oscillatory magnetic reconnection at a coronal bright point (CBP). The reconnection is characterised by two bursty phases defined by a reconnection reversal. In the first phase, a current sheet (C1) is found to form in front of an expanding loop of the bright point. Interestingly, C1 shorten to a null point during 10 minutes after reaching its maximum length (~2.4Mm). Less than 3 minutes later, a new current sheet (C2) was clearly seen to grow out from the null point, but along an orthogonal direction relative to C1. C2 reached a maximum length of ~4 Mm in ten minutes and then has become short and invisible in the next few minutes as the reconnection has declined. The magnetic reconnection is evidenced by the brightening, plasma flow and temperature increase at the ends of both C1 and C2. No significant magnetic cancellation or emergence but gradual convergence has occurred during a few hours before the reconnection underneath the CBP. The transition from C1 to C2 suggests the occurrence of coronal oscillatory reconnection with once reconnection reversal, whereby the inflow and outflow regions in the first phase become the outflow and inflow regions in the second phase, respectively. It is further found that the oscillatory reconnection could slightly modulate the change in brightness of the coronal bright point.","['Junchao Hong', 'Jiayan Yang', 'Yi Bi', 'Bo Yang']",7.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13859,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,,,['Solar corona (1483) — Solar magnetic reconnection(1504) — coronal bright point 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178,"Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.","['Yu-Sik Kim', 'Jae-Young Kim']",13.0,23.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13876,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],,,['galaxies: active – BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 0735 +178 – Quasars: individual: PKS 0735 +178 – neutrinos – radio continuum: galaxies – techniques: interferometric 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Multi-dimensional Models of Mixed H/He Flames in X-ray Bursts,"We investigate the properties of mixed H/He flames in X-ray bursts using 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We find that as the initial hydrogen abundance of the atmosphere increases, the flame is less energetic and propagates slower. The simulation outcome, whether a flame forms and whether there's runaway burning at the base of the atmosphere, is very sensitive to the initial model and the nuclear reaction network used. We also see that at late times a secondary flame ignites, with the ignition mechanism dependent on the composition.","['Eric T.

The Initial Mass Function of the Galactic Early-type Field Stars Based on the LAMOST Survey,"Research on the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) has been limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study, based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end (1.5 < M/Msun < 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 - 2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in metallicity.","['Qida Li', 'Jianping Xiong', 'Zhenwei Li', 'Dan Qiu', 'Chao Liu', 'Zhanwen Han', 'Xuefei Chen']",9.0,9.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13935,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Initial mass function (796 )'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Accretion of AGN Stars under Influence of Disk Geometry,"Massive stars can form within or be captured by AGN disks, influencing both the thermal structure and metallicity of the disk environment. In a previous work, we investigated isotropic accretion onto massive stars from a gas-rich, high-entropy background. Here, we consider a more realistic scenario by incorporating the stratified geometry of the background disk in our 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulatons. We find that accretion remains relatively isotropic when the disk is hot enough and the scale height is thicker than the accretion flow's nominal supersonic critical radius $R{crit}$ (sub-thermal). However, when the disk becomes cold, the accretion flow becomes significantly anisotropic (super-thermal). Escaping stellar and accretion luminosity can drive super-Eddington outflows in the polar region, while rapid accretion is sustained along the midplane. Eventually, the effective cross-section is constrained by the Hill radius and the disk scale height rather than the critical radius when the disk is cold enough. For our setup (stellar mass $\sim 50 M\odot$ and background density $\rho\sim 10^{-10}$ g/cm$^3$) the accretion rates is capped below $\sim 0.02M\odot$/year and the effective accretion parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-1}$ over disk temperature range $3 - 7 \times 10^4$ K. Spiral arms facilitate inward mass flux by driving outward angular momentum transport. Gap-opening effects may further reduce the long-term accretion rate, albeit to confirm which requires global simulations evolved over much longer viscous timescales.","['Yi-Xian Chen', 'Yan-Fei Jiang', 'Jeremy Goodman']",11.0,18.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13951,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,['Solar and Stellar Astrophysics'],,,[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Capture and Escape of Planetary Mean-motion Resonances in Turbulent Discs,"Mean-motion resonances (MMRs) form through convergent disc migration of planet pairs, which may be disrupted by dynamical instabilities after protoplanetary disc (PPD) dispersal. This scenario is supported by recent analysis of TESS data showing that neighboring planet pairs in younger planetary systems are closer to resonance. To study stability of MMRs during migration, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of migrating planet pairs in PPDs, comparing the effect of laminar viscosity and realistic turbulence. We find stable 3:2 resonance capture for terrestrial planet pairs migrating in a moderately massive PPD, insensitive to a range of laminar viscosity (alpha = 0.001 to 0.1). However, realistic turbulence enhances overstability by sustaining higher equilibrium eccentricities and a positive growth rate in libration amplitude, ultimately leading to resonance escape. The equilibrium eccentricity growth rates decrease as planets migrate into tighter and more stable 4:3 and 5:4 MMRs. Our results suggest that active disc turbulence broadens the parameter space for overstability, causing planet pairs to end up in closer-in orbital separations. Libration within MMR typically lead to deviation from exact period ratio |Delta| \sim 0.5%, which alone is insufficient to produce the typical dispersion of |Delta| \sim 1 to 3% in TESS data, suggesting that post migration dynamical processes are needed to further amplify the offset.","['Yi-Xian Chen', 'Yinhao Wu', 'Ya-Ping Li', 'Douglas N.

WALLABY pilot survey: Spatially resolved gas scaling relations within the stellar discs of nearby galaxies,"The scatter in global atomic hydrogen (HI) scaling relations is partly attributed to differences in how HI and stellar properties are measured, with HI reservoirs typically extending beyond the inner regions of galaxies where star formation occurs. Using pilot observations from the WALLABY survey, we present the first measurements of HI mass enclosed within the stellar-dominated regions of galaxies for a statistical sample of 995 local gas-rich systems, investigating the factors driving its variation. We examine how global HI scaling relations change when measurements are restricted to R25 and R24 -- the isophotal radii at 25 and 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i-band -- and explore how the fraction of HI mass and HI surface density within these radii correlate with other galaxy properties. On average, 68% of the total HI mass is enclosed within R25 and 54% within R24, though significant variation exists between galaxies. The fraction of HI mass within R25 shows a mild correlation with stellar properties, with galaxies of higher stellar mass, greater stellar surface density, or redder colours enclosing a larger fraction of their HI reservoirs. These correlations do not significantly strengthen when considering R24. Conversely, global HI surface densities show no significant correlation with stellar mass or stellar surface density, but trends start emerging when these are measured within the inner regions of galaxies. The strongest correlation is observed with optical colour, with bluer galaxies having higher average HI surface densities within R25. This trend strengthens when we restrict from R25 to R24, suggesting a closer connection between inner HI reservoirs and star formation.

XXII. Accurate stellar velocity dispersions of the SL2S lens sample and the lensing mass fundamental plane,"We reanalyze spectra taken as part of the SL2S lens galaxy survey, with the goal to obtain stellar velocity dispersion with precision and accuracy sufficient for time-delay cosmography. In order to achieve this goal, we impose stringent cuts on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and employ recently developed methods to mitigate and quantify residual systematic errors due to template libraries and fitting process. We also quantify the covariance across the sample. For galaxies with spectra with SNR > 20/Å, our new measurements have average random uncertainty of 3-4%, average systematic uncertainty of 2%, and covariance across the sample of 1%. We find negligible covariance between spectra taken with different instruments. The systematic uncertainty and covariance need to be included when the sample is used as an external dataset in time-delay cosmography. We revisit empirical scaling relations of lens galaxies based on the improved kinematics. We show that the SLS2 sample, the TDCOSMO time-delay lens sample, and the lower redshift SLACS sample follow the same correlation between effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion and lensing mass, known as the lensing mass fundamental plane, as that derived by Auger et al. (2010) assuming isothermal mass profiles for the deflectors. We also derive for the first time the lensing mass fundamental plane assuming free power-law mass density profiles, and show that the three samples also follow the same correlation. This is consistent with a scenario in which massive galaxies evolve by growing their radii and mass, but staying within the plane.","['Pritom Mozumdar', 'Shawn Knabel', 'Tommaso Treu', 'Alessandro Sonnenfeld', 'Anowar J.

Deciphering the Formation and Dynamics of Double-decker Filament Through Component Magnetic Reconnection,"The formation of double-decker filaments has long been an enigma in the field of solar physics. Using stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we show that the double-decker filament formed on 2013 August 30 resulted from the splitting of a braided magnetic flux rope. The splitting was driven by component magnetic reconnection between intertwined field lines, triggered by the rotational motion in a part of one filament footpoint. This mechanism, inferred from observed small jets, brightenings, and bidirectional mass flows, differs from the previous conclusion attributing filament splitting to magnetic reconnection between the legs of confining magnetic field lines within or above the filament. The splitting speed might be modulated by the reconnection speed, as evidenced by the correspondence between the filament's slow and fast rising phases and the intermittent and violent brightening stages. Following the splitting, the upper branch of the double-decker filament erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), giving rise to a GOES soft X-ray M1.2 flare. In conclusion, our observations present a new formation mechanism for double-decker filaments, and the subsequent partial eruption is likely attributable to the torus instability of the background coronal magnetic field. Moreover, the detection of small jets within the filament provides new insights into the role of component magnetic reconnection in localized coronal heating processes.","['Dongxu Liu', 'Yuandeng Shen', 'Yi Bi', 'Zehao Tang', 'Chengrui Zhou', 'Surui Yao']",6.0,14.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13981,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,the ApJL,,['Sun: activity — Sun: flares — Sun: filaments — Sun: jets — Sun: magnetic fields 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
ThermoONet -- a deep learning-based small body thermophysical network: applications to modelling water activity of comets,"Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope, respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.

Quasar identifications from the slitless spectra: a test from 3D-HST,"Slitless spectroscopy is a traditional method for selecting quasars. In this paper, we develop a procedure for selecting quasars (QSOs) using the 3D-HST G141 slitless spectra. We initially identify over 6,000 sources with emission lines broader than those typically found in emission line galaxies (ELGs) by analyzing the 1D spectra. These ``broad'' emission lines may originate from actual QSO broad lines ($\rm FWHM\geq1200~\rm km/s$) or the convolved narrow lines ($\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\rm km/s$) in ELGs with effective radii $\geq$0.3"" (2.5Kpc at z=1). We then propose a criterion based on the reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation spectra, we find that our criterion successfully selects about 90\% of known QSOs with H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ line detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about 5\%. We apply this method to emission line sources without significant contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift $z=0.12-1.56$. 12 of these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader range of the rest-frame UV colors and has redder optical slopes compared to the SDSS QSOs, yet it is more likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of the sample are $10^{6.9}-10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$.

Selected open cluster sample for validating atmospheric parameters: Application to Gaia and other surveys,"Reliable stellar atmospheric parameters are essential for probing stellar structure and evolution, and for stellar population studies. However, various deviations appear in comparisons with different ground-based spectroscopic surveys. We aim to select high-quality open cluster members and employ the atmospheric parameters provided by the theoretical isochrones of open clusters as a benchmark to assess the quality of stellar atmospheric parameters from Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases, whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.","['Tong Tang', 'Songmei Qin', 'Jing Zhong', 'Yueyue Jiang', 'Li Chen']",11.0,11.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14034,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Astrophysics of Galaxies'],Astronomy & Astrophysics,,['open clusters and associations: general – stars: abundances – stars: fundamental parameters – stars: Hertzsprung-Russell and C-M diagrams – surveys: Gaia 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06,"Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.","['Jihye Hwang', 'Kate Pattle', 'Chang Won Lee', 'Janik Karoly', 'Kee-Tae Kim', 'Jongsoo Kim', 'Junhao Liu', 'Keping Qiu', 'A-Ran Lyo', 'David Eden', 'Patrick M.

"Zangetsu: A Candidate of Isolated, Quiescent, and Backsplash Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy in the COSMOS Field","Deep imaging surveys have changed our view of the low surface brightness (LSB) Universe. The ""renaissance"" of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy population, as the prime example of such recent development, continues to challenge our understanding of galaxy formation. Here, We report the serendipitous discovery of Zangetsu, an isolated, quiescent, and distorted ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the COSMOS field, using images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Zangetsu exhibits an extremely low central surface brightness ($\mathrm{\mu_{0,g}}=26.60\pm0.01$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), a very shallow inner surface brightness profile ($\mathrm{n}_{\rm Sersic}=0.40\pm0.01$), and a large angular size ($\mathrm{R_e}\approx 10.44$ arcsec). Surprisingly, Zangetsu also has a quiescent stellar population ($\mathrm{g-i}=0.96$), an unusually elongated shape ($\mathrm{b/a}\sim 0.25$), and mild morphological asymmetry, making it a rare case among known UDGs. Surface brightness fluctuation analysis of HSC and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images only provides a distance lower limit of $D>25.4$ Mpc (thus $\mathrm{R_e}>1.38$ kpc). However, Zangetsu remains an extreme outlier in the luminosity-size relation of known LSB galaxies, suggesting that it could be an exceptionally large and/or diffuse system. Classic internal or external UDG formation mechanisms alone struggle to explain such a system. A backsplash origin may account for its isolation and quiescent nature. This finding also raises the possibility that current works may overlook similarly extreme, elongated systems that could further our understanding of the LSB Universe.","['Leyao Wei', 'Song Huang', 'Jiaxuan Li', 'Zechang Sun', 'Mingyu Li', 'Jiaxin Tang']",11.0,25.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14073,Astrophysics of Galaxies,,,,['Dwarf galaxies (416) — Galaxy photometry (611) — Galaxy structure (622) — Low surface bright- ness galaxies (940) 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy cluster catalogues,"In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result.

Coronal Magnetometry with EUV Permitted Lines,"A major challenge in solar physics is to obtain empirical information on the magnetic field of the million-degree plasma of the solar corona. To this end, we need observables of the solar radiation sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. The most familiar observables are the polarization signals of visible and near-infrared forbidden lines of highly ionized species and some ultraviolet permitted lines, like hydrogen Lyman-{\alpha}. While the coronal radiation in these spectral lines can only be detected for off-limb line of sights, the coronal radiation from permitted extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines can be observed also on the solar disk. These coronal lines are mainly collisionally excited, but it has been pointed out that some permitted EUV lines can actually be linearly polarized if their lower level carries atomic alignment, and that their linear polarization is sensitive to the orientation of the coronal magnetic field (see Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno 2009). Here we theoretically investigate the linear polarization in permitted EUV lines of a variety of ions: Fe X, Fe XI, Fe XIII, Fe XIV, Si IX, and Si X. To this end, we have developed a numerical code, which we have applied to investigate the linear polarization and magnetic sensitivity of many permitted EUV lines in a one-dimensional model of the solar corona, providing a list of the most promising lines to be further investigated for polarimetry with future space telescopes. Our next step will be to extend this work by using state-of-the-art three-dimensional coronal models.","['Nataliia G.

No Evidence for Second-Scale Periodicity in FRB 20201124A from FAST Observations,"Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright and short radio flashes of cosmological origin. Although a great number of FRBs were detected in the last two decades, their progenitors and the physical processes that create them are unknown. In recent years, magnetars have been proposed as one of the leading progenitor candidates. A striking feature that can hint at such a magnetar origin is second-scale periodicity. In this paper, we define a robust procedure to search for such periodicity and estimate the significance of its results. We search for such periodicity in the bursts of FRB 20201124A, observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) between April and June 2021. Our analysis does not find any significant periodicity. We discuss the differences between our non-detection and the ~1.7s periodicity claim by C. Du et al.

3D matter power spectrum correspondence to 1D Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum,"The 3D distribution of matter at small scales encodes valuable information about the nature of dark matter and other fundamental physics. A prominent probe of such scales outside galaxies is the Lyman-alpha forest, which studies absorption features in the spectra of high-redshift quasars caused by neutral hydrogen. The measured quantity is the power spectrum of the absorbed flux, which indirectly traces the underlying matter distribution. However, the connection between the measured flux power spectrum and the underlying 3D dark matter power spectrum is highly nontrivial. The flux power spectrum (i) represents a one-dimensional projection of the density field; (ii) traces only neutral hydrogen, subject to thermodynamic pressure; and (iii) is a nonlinear function of local matter density. Additionally, thermal broadening and redshift-space distortions-determined not only by the hydrogen distribution but also by its thermal state and local velocity field-further complicate interpretation. To robustly constrain dark matter properties using the Lyman-alpha forest, these systematics must be carefully modeled and controlled. In this paper, we present a simple phenomenological recipe for mapping the 3D matter power spectrum to the flux power spectrum. We first motivate our approach in the linear regime, then extend it to later times and into the nonlinear regime. We validate our model against a broad suite of warm and cold dark matter simulations, demonstrating that our recipe yields consistent and accurate estimates across a wide parameter space.","['Ivan Ridkokasha', 'Andres Aramburo-Garcia', 'Kyrylo Bondarenko', 'Anastasia Sokolenko', 'Matthieu Schaller', 'Alexey Boyarsky']",13.0,22.0,1.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14258,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,,,,[],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Application of Deep Learning to the Classification of Stokes Profiles: From the Quiet Sun to Sunspots,"The morphology of circular polarisation profiles from solar spectropolarimetric observations encode information about the magnetic field strength, inclination, and line-of-sight velocity gradients. Previous studies used manual methods or unsupervised machine learning (ML) to classify the shapes of circular polarisation profiles. We trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) comparing classifications with unsupervised ML. The method was tested on quiet Sun datasets from DKIST, Hinode, and GREGOR, as well as simulations of granulation and a sunspot. We achieve validation metrics typically close to or above $90\%$. We also present the first statistical analysis of quiet Sun DKIST/ViSP data using inversions and our supervised classifier. We demonstrate that classifications with unsupervised ML alone can introduce systemic errors that could compromise statistical comparisons. DKIST and Hinode classifications in the quiet Sun are similar, despite our modelling indicating spatial resolution differences should alter the shapes of circular polarization signals. Asymmetrical (symmetrical) profiles are less (more) common in GREGOR than DKIST or Hinode data, consistent with narrower response functions in the $1564.85$ nm line. Single-lobed profiles are extremely rare in GREGOR data. In the sunspot simulation, the $630.25$ nm line produces ``double' profiles in the penumbra, likely a manifestation of magneto-optical effects in horizontal fields; these are rarer in the $1564.85$ nm line. We find the $1564.85$ nm line detects more reverse polarity magnetic fields in the penumbra in contradiction to observations. We detect mixed-polarity profiles in nearly one fifth of the penumbra. Supervised ML robustly classifies solar spectropolarimetric data, enabling detailed statistical analyses of magnetic fields.","['Ryan James Campbell', 'Mihalis Mathioudakis', 'Carlos Quintero Noda', 'Peter Keys', 'David Orozco Suárez']",11.0,20.0,3.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14275,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,,ApJ,,['Concept: Classification – Concept: neural networks – Sun: photosphere — Sun: magnetic fields 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
The first direct imaging of the silhouette of a damped Lyman $α$ system along the line-of-sight to a background galaxy,"The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission. Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$, identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure, implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.","['Fuga Komori', 'Akio K.

"CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) IV: New planetary systems around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 and an update on HD 121056","With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.","['E.

Non-ideal MHD simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres,"In Hot Jupiters (HJs), atmospherically induced magnetic fields are expected to play an important role in controlling the wind circulation and in determining their inflated radii. Here we perform 1D plane-parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of HJ atmospheric columns, using the wind and thermodynamic profiles generated by global circulation models of different exo-planets. We quantitatively investigate the effects of magnetic field winding and Ohmic dissipation (previously considered in several works), with the addition of Hall drift and ambipolar diffusion. The main effect is the magnetic field winding in the full non-linear regime, with local azimuthal fields reaching maximum values up to ${\cal O}(10^2)$ G at the shear layer (typical pressure $\sim 1$ bar), much stronger than the assumed background field generated in the planetary interior. The associated meridional currents undergo Ohmic dissipation, with local heating efficiencies of at least $\sim$ ${10^{-6}}-10^{-3}$ (considering only these shallow layers). In addition to the dominant winding vs. Ohmic balance, the presence of the Hall and ambipolar terms have a non-negligible contribution in shaping and twisting the induced magnetic field at $p\lesssim 1$ bar; however this effect is only apparent for the hottest planets. Our results, though limited by construction to a plane-parallel approximation of the sub-stellar columns and with a simplified setup that cannot consistently include the magnetic drag on the wind, assess the non-linearity and complexity of the magnetic induction in HJs atmospheres, and call for a self-consistent inclusion of MHD effects in Ohmic dissipation studies and circulation models, beyond the often-assumed perturbative regime.","['Clàudia Soriano-Guerrero', 'Daniele Viganò', 'Rosalba Perna', 'Albert Elias-López', 'Hayley Beltz']",10.0,18.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14342,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,['planets and satellites: magnetic fields'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
Cen A hotspot in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays illuminated by M83 or Cen A?,"The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.","['K. Dolgikh', 'A.

Towards mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium IV. Using NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence,"Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the mid-2030s will carry X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will enable unique insight in the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial capabilities. The high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters.Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the structure function.Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics.Conclusions. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision of recovered turbulent features.

Improving the Γ-functions Method for Vortex Identification,"Vortices have been observed at various heights within the solar atmosphere and are suggested to potentially play great roles in heating the solar upper atmosphere. Multiple automated vortex detection methods have been developed and applied to detect vortices. We aim to improve the $\Gamma$-functions method for vortex identification by optimizing the value of $\Gamma_{1min}$ and the approach to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ used to determine vortex center and edge. In this way, we can detect vortices more accurately and enable more statistical studies that can improve our knowledge of the generation and evolution of vortices in the solar atmosphere. We apply the automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA, one representative of $\Gamma$-functions method) with different parameters to various synthetic data, with each containing 1000 Lamb-Oseen vortices, and search for the optimal $\Gamma_{1min}$ and kernel size when calculating $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. We also compare another detection method using simulation and observational data to validate the results obtained from the synthetic data. The best performance is found with the Optimized ASDA, which combines different kernel sizes (5, 7, 9, and 11) to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with a fixed $\Gamma_{1min}$ = 0.63 to detect vortex center. We find that more vortices can be detected by the Optimized ASDA with higher location, radius, and rotation speed accuracies. The above results are further confirmed by comparing vortices detected by the Optimized ASDA and the SWIRL method on CO5BOLD numerical simulation data and SST observational data.","['Quan Xie', 'Jiajia Liu', 'Robert Erdélyi', 'Yuming Wang']",7.0,14.0,5.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14384,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics'],,,['Sun: activities – Sun: vortices – Method: improvement 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate

Counterpart-Induced Millisecond-Scale Truncation Mechanism of Fast Radio Bursts,"The observed millisecond-scale duration is an essential yet mysterious feature of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this Letter, we link the observed soft gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 to electron-positron pair cascades driven by Compton scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that such pair cascades can truncate FRBs to durations down to millisecond-scale, thereby establishing millisecond-scale upper bounds on their durations. The physical processes involved in the truncation mechanism occur during the propagation of FRBs after their production. Consequently, this mechanism is independent of the specific production mechanism or origin of the FRBs, suggesting that it could potentially operate in all FRBs. Our results lift the constraint on FRB production mechanisms that they must inherently generate bursts lasting only milliseconds.","['Yutong He', 'Christoph H.

Five New Sirius-Like White Dwarf + Main Sequence Star Systems with MagAO-X,"Most known white dwarfs in multiple systems with main sequence stars have been discovered with M-type companions, because the white dwarf causes detectable UV excess and bluer colors than expected from a single M star. Surveys have shown that the number of white dwarfs in Sirius-like systems within 100 pc of the Sun is lower than expected, suggesting that white dwarfs are being missed in the glare of their main sequence companions. In this work we have leveraged the angular resolution and high-contrast capabilities, as well as optimization for visible wavelengths, of the extreme adaptive optics instrument MagAO-X to detect new white dwarf companions to AFGK stars. We present the first results of our survey with the extreme AO instrument MagAO-X, called the Pup Search, of 18 targets with seven new candidate companions, five of which are confirmed to be white dwarfs. We discuss the new detections in the context of previous surveys and other detection metric sensitivities and show that we are sensitive to a region not probed by other surveys. Finally we discuss the future of the Pup Search in light of developing technologies.","['Logan A. Pearce', 'Jared R. Males', 'Sebastiaan Y. Haffert', 'Laird M. Close', 'Joseph D. Long', 'Eden A.

First Identification and Precise Spectral Measurement of the Proton Component in the Cosmic-Ray `Knee',"We report the first high-purity identification of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and a precise measurement of their energy spectrum from 0.15 to 12 PeV using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Abundant event statistics, combined with the simultaneous detection of electrons/photons, muons, and Cherenkov light in air showers, enable spectroscopic measurements with statistical and systematic accuracy comparable to satellite data at lower energies. The proton spectrum shows significant hardening relative to low-energy extrapolations, culminating at 3 PeV, followed by sharp softening. This distinct spectral structure - closely aligned with the knee in the all-particle spectrum - points to the emergence of a new CR component at PeV energies, likely linked to the dozens of PeVatrons recently discovered by LHAASO, and offers crucial clues to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.","['LHAASO Collaboration', 'Zhen Cao', 'F.

OSIRIS-REx Operational Key Decision Points: A Retrospective,"OSIRIS-REx, NASA's first asteroid sample return mission, rendezvoused with the near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018 and delivered a 121.6-gram sample to Earth in 2023, the largest amount of material ever recovered from a planetary body beyond the Moon. The operations phase of OSIRIS-REx was considered the most challenging robotic mission that NASA had undertaken, owing to the tight constraints on spacecraft performance and the microgravity environment. In preparation for the sample collection and return campaign, the mission leadership defined four operational key decision points (OKDPs) at critical junctures: sample site selection, rehearsal and execution of the sample collection maneuver, sample stow, and Earth return. This publication examines these OKDPs in depth, inclusive of rationale, implementation, decision processes, and efficacy. We also review other decisions that enabled mission success despite the unexpectedly rugged nature of Bennu's surface. This information should be beneficial for future challenging operational concepts where science-in-the-loop, time-critical decision making is integral to success.","['Rich Burns', 'Dante S.

Minimizing Contaminant Leakage in Internal Linear Combination Maps Using a Data-Driven Approach,"The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, the inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off high-energy electrons, is a powerful probe of hot, ionized gas in the Universe. It is often measured via cross-correlations of CMB data with large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to constrain gas physics and improve cosmological constraints. The largest source of bias to these measurements is the leakage of poorly understood thermal dust emission from star-forming galaxies -- the cosmic infrared background (CIB) -- into the tSZ maps. This CIB contamination is difficult to clean via multifrequency component separation methods, such as internal linear combination (ILC), due to uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution (SED), which exhibits spatial and line-of-sight variation and decorrelation. Thus, improved ILC-based techniques have been developed to null (""deproject"") both the CIB and its first moment with respect to the emissivity index $\beta$ in order to robustly remove the CIB despite the lack of first-principles knowledge of its SED. While decreasing the bias, such procedures can significantly increase the noise in the resulting ILC maps. In this paper, we develop a data-driven algorithm for determining the optimal CIB SED to deproject when measuring a tSZ-LSS cross-correlation, obviating the need to deproject the first moment in the ILC map used for such a measurement. Our method gives an unbiased cross-correlation with increased signal-to-noise. We demonstrate its efficacy on simulations, finding a 60% improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio for an example tSZ cross-correlation with a halo sample at redshifts $0.8 < z < 1.8$, as compared to moment deprojection approaches. Though used here for CIB removal in tSZ cross-correlations, our method is broadly applicable to minimizing contaminant leakage in ILC maps. Our code is available in CIB-deproj.","['Kristen M.

A model of magnetised and rotating convection for stellar and planetary interiors,"Convection is a fundamental mechanism for energy transport in stars and planets, playing a pivotal role in shaping their structures and evolution. The Mixing-Length Theory, a monomodal approach to convection, is widely adopted and implemented in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes. However, it overlooks the combined effects of rotation and magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous across a wide range of stars and planets. To address this limitation, we extend the Mixing-Length Theory including both rotation and magnetic fields within a Cartesian set-up. Building on the work by Stevenson 1979, we use a heat-flux maximisation principle, which amounts to selecting the convective mode that carries the most heat. Our findings show that both rotation and magnetic fields individually tend to suppress convection. However, when combined, they can enhance convection strength under certain conditions. We derive expressions for the root-mean-square (rms) velocity, characteristic length scale, and degree of superadiabaticity as functions of the rotation rate and magnetic field strength. These results offer new insights for more accurately modeling convection and its impact on stellar and planetary structures in one-dimensional and forthcoming multi-dimensional evolution models.","['Leïla Bessila', 'Stéphane Mathis']",8.0,14.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14650,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,['Earth and Planetary Astrophysics'],Astronomy & Astrophysics,,['convection - Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) - Instabilities - magnetic field - stars: rotation 1'],2025-05-21,Duplicate
"The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 at Their Previous Return to Perihelion in the Twelfth Century: One Spectacular, the Other Dull","New insights into the history of C/1843 D1 and C/1882 R1, the two celebrated Kreutz sungrazers, are provided by assessing evidence on their appearance at the previous perihelion return, known as X/1106 C1 and the Chinese comet of 1138 (Ho's No. 403), respectively. The conditions differed vastly because of disparities in geocentric distance, solar elongation, and phase correction (forward scattering), all linked to the arrival times (early February vs early August). The conclusions include: the daytime sighting of the 1106 comet by Sigebert de Gembloux is consistent with expectation and so are the accounts of an exceptionally long tail observed later in twilight; the comet reached perihelion only hours before its daytime detection; the 1138 comet could have never been sighted in daylight or discovered much earlier than it actually was, in early September, one month after perihelion; at discovery, the tail is predicted to have reached elevations of 15-30 deg, while the head was only 10 deg above horizon, when observed from moderate northern latitudes; the notion that Kreutz sungrazers at perihelion between mid-May and mid-August could not be seen from the ground except possibly in daylight is misleading; the appearance of the 1138 comet's nucleus after its tidal fragmentation at perihelion is modeled on the assumption that it consisted of five major fragments (including C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1); and unpredictable morphological changes with time in the 1882 sungrazer's split nucleus are discussed.",['Zdenek Sekanina'],14.0,20.0,9.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14662,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,,,,"['C/1965S1', 'comets:X/1106C1', '1138', 'X/1702D1', 'C/1882R1']",2025-05-21,Duplicate
A JWST View of the Overmassive Black Hole in NGC 4486B,"We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.","['Behzad Tahmasebzadeh', 'Matthew A. Taylor', 'Monica Valluri', 'Haruka Yoshino', 'Eugene Vasiliev', 'Michael J.

HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST,"Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($>$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.","['Katerina Slavicinska', 'Łukasz Tychoniec', 'María Gabriela Navarro', 'Ewine F. van Dishoeck', 'John J.

Solar Flare Prediction Using LSTM and DLSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition,"We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.","['Zeinab Hassani', 'Davud Mohammadpur', 'Hossein Safari']",8.0,15.0,4.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05313,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning']",,,[],2025-07-09,Ghost/Extra (Not in Pure List)
Can Orbital Decay of Accreting Binary Pulsars Probe Dark Matter?,"The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.",['Arvind Kumar Mishra'],2.0,9.0,2.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06178,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-07-09,Ghost/Extra (Not in Pure List)
Characterization of mini-CryoCube detectors from the Ricochet experiment commissioning at the Institut Laue-Langevin,"The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.","['Antoine Armatol', 'Corinne Augier', 'Louis Bailly-Salins', 'Guillaume Baulieu', 'Laurent Bergé', 'Julien Billard', 'Juliette Blé', 'Guillaume Bres', 'Jean-Louis Bret', 'Alexandre Broniatowski', 'Martino Calvo', 'Antonella Cavanna', 'Antoine Cazes', 'Emanuela Celi', 'David Chaize', 'Mohammed Chala', 'Maurice Chappellier', 'Luke Chaplinsky', 'Guillaume Chemin', 'Ran Chen', 'Jules Colas', 'Laurent Couraud', 'Elspeth Cudmore', 'Maryvonne De Jesus', 'Nicole Dombrowski', 'Louis Dumoulin', 'Alan Durnez', 'Olivier Exshaw', 'Sylvain Ferriol', 'Enectali Figueroa-Feliciano', 'Joseph A.

The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data,"The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.",['Tanmoy Modak'],7.0,15.0,0.0,arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02979,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"['General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'High Energy Physics - Phenomenology']",,,[],2025-09-04,Ghost/Extra (Not in Pure List)

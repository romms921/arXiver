         "Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",

         "We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona. We fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable values of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The models both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their treatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return different mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future reverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to constrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised via Bayesian priors.",

         "Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (< 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.",

         "The Impact of Bar-induced Non-Circular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves",
         "We study the impact of bar-induced non-circular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that non-circular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the position angle difference ($\\Delta \\phi$) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For $\\left|\\Delta \\phi\\right|\\lesssim40^\\circ$, non-circular motions produce a bar-induced \"dip\" feature (rise-drop-rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (${\\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA barred galaxies sample. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the \"dip\" feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low $\\left|\\Delta \\phi\\right|$ streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance $V_\\mathrm{los}$, while those in the bar tend to suppress $V_\\mathrm{los}$. We use a simple {\\misaell} model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$) and the discrepancy between ${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$ and ${\\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced \"dip\" feature in the RCs of barred galaxies combining both simulations and observations.",

         "The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.",

         "Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.",

Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations.Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network.Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach.Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports.Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.",

         "The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\\,\\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \\gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\\sim 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation.

         "This paper presents an analysis of the predicted optical-to-X-ray spectral index ($\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$) within the context of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) associated with stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. We use the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate the evolution of binary systems and investigate the relationship between UV and X-ray emission during the ULX phase, namely the $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ relation. The study investigates the impact of metallicity on $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant anti-correlation between $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\\rm UV}$), consistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with metallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent slope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of ULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data, and the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with metallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower metallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant impact on the XLF and $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates, where the emission is focused into narrower cones. Furthermore, the study finds that UV emission in ULXs is predominantly disk-dominated, which is the likely origin of the $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ relation, with the percentage of disk-dominated ULXs increasing as metallicity rises.",

         "We present a study of the radio and optical properties of the high-frequency peaker (HFP) blazar PKS 1614+051 at $z=3.21$ based on the data covering the time period of 1997-2024. The radio data are represented by the almost instantaneous 1-22 GHz measurements from the SAO RAS RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the IAA RAS RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope of CrAO RAS. The optical measurements in the $R$ band were collected with the SAO RAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes and the ZTF archive data. We have found low overall variability indices (0.1-0.2) and a spectral peak around 4.6 GHz, which is stable during the long-term period of monitoring. An analysis of the radio light curves reveals significant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along with variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest frame, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts. Spectral modeling suggests the presence of both synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) processes. Based on the SSA model, we provide estimates of the magnetic field strength, which peaks at $\\sim\\!30$ mG. A spectroscopic study with the BTA SCORPIO-I spectrograph has found signs of the regular motion of a neutral hydrogen envelope around the blazar center, which confirms the presence of enough gaseous matter to form an external FFA screen. The results highlight the importance of multiwavelength and long-term monitoring to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability in high-redshift blazars.",

         "We have been developing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detectors with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure, named \"XRPIX\", for X-ray astronomy. In our previous study, we successfully optimized the design of the PDD structure, achieving both the suppression of large leakage current and satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Here, we report a detailed study on the X-ray spectroscopic performance of the XRPIX with the optimized PDD structure. The data were obtained at $-60^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ with the \"event-driven readout mode\", in which only a triggering pixel and its surroundings are read out. The energy resolutions in full width at half maximum at 6.4 keV are $178\\pm1$ eV and $291\\pm1$ eV for single-pixel and all-pixel event spectra, respectively. The all-pixel events include charge-sharing pixel events as well as the single-pixel events. These values are the best achieved in the history of our development. We argue that the gain non-linearity in the low energy side due to excessive charge injection to the charge-sensitive amplifier is a major factor to limit the current spectroscopic performance. Optimization of the amount of the charge injection is expected to lead to further improvement in the spectroscopic performance of XRPIX, especially for the all-pixel event spectrum.",

         "The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 $\\text{deg}^2$. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover a wavelength range from 2550 to 10000Å at a resolution of $R\\sim 200$ and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with the r-band magnitudes of $18<\\text{m}_{\\text{r}}<22$ using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code. Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying the strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate the black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts $z=0-5$ from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99\\%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90\\% of them could have precise redshift measurements with $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{NMAD}}=0.002$. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1-0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to AGN science and cosmology.",

We show that the PNG signature in $C_{\\ell}$ is confined to low multipoles in the linear regime, whereas its signature in $w(\\theta)$ extends across a wide range of angular scales, including those below the nonlinear scale. Therefore, the equivalence between $C_\\ell$ and $w(\\theta)$ can be violated when scale cuts of multipoles or angular scales -- for example, to mitigate systematic effects -- are applied in the analysis. Assuming samples of photometric galaxies divided into multiple redshift bins in the range $0<z<7$, we forecast the precision of constraining the PNG parameter ($f_{\\rm NL}$) from the hypothetical measurements of $C_\\ell$ or $w(\\theta)$ assuming different scale cuts in the multipoles or angular scales, respectively.

         "To study the formation of star clusters and their properties in a dwarf-dwarf merging galaxy, we have performed a numerical simulation of a dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger by using the Tree+GRAPE $N$-body/SPH code ASURA. In our simulation, 13 young star clusters are formed during the merger process. We show that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and without [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star cluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars contaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the energy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas. After that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new generation of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star clusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter and fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several hundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters take place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are tidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge at the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster. Therefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components in [Fe/H] abundance and age. We discuss our work in the context of observations and demonstrate the diagnostic power of high-resolution simulations in the context of star cluster formation.",

         "We present a theoretical model to investigate a two-planet pair that undergoes convergent type I migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk and traps into the first-order mean motion resonance. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and explores the subsequent dynamical stability of the system. We derive the analytical criteria for planets with an arbitrary mass ratio and validate through numerical N-body simulations. Slow migration and weak eccentricity damping are required for resonant capture, the latter of which has not received enough attention in the literature. Once capture into resonance, their following stability can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Notably, resonant capture remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. However, the subsequent evolution can be diverse when the mass of the inner planet is lower or comparable to that of the outer planet. Stability weakens as the relative strength between migration and eccentricity damping increases. The key results can be comprehensively demonstrated in a $\\tau_{a}$-$\\tau_{a}/\\tau_{\\rm e}$ plot, where $\\tau_{a}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm e}$ are orbital decay and eccentricity damping timescales, respectively.",

This flexible design facilitates the extensibility and adaptability of ExoSim 2 to diverse instrument configurations to address the evolving needs of the scientific community. Data management within ExoSim 2 is handled by the Signal class, which represents a structured data cube incorporating time, space, and spectral dimensions. The code execution in ExoSim 2 follows a three-step workflow: the creation of focal planes, the production of Sub-Exposure blocks, and the generation of non-destructive reads (NDRs). Each step can be executed independently, optimizing time and computational resources. ExoSim 2 has been extensively validated against other tools like ArielRad and has demonstrated consistency in estimating photon conversion efficiency, saturation time, and signal generation. The simulator has also been validated independently for instantaneous read-out and jitter simulation, and for astronomical signal representation. In conclusion, ExoSim 2 offers a robust and flexible tool for exoplanet observation simulation, capable of adapting to diverse instrument configurations and evolving scientific needs.

         "Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.",

         "Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.",

         "We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.",

Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience.

The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications.

The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\\rm dyn}<4 \\times 10^8~M_{\\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{10}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.",

         "We report results on the internal dynamical evolution of old star clusters located in the outer regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Because the SMC has been imprinted with evidence of tidal interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we investigated at what extend such an interaction has produced extra tidal structures or excess of stars beyond the clusters' tidal radii. For that purpose, we used the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 data sets to build number density radial profiles of suitable star clusters, and derived their structural and internal dynamics parameters. The analysed stellar density profiles do not show any evidence of tidal effects caused by the LMC. On the contrary, the Jacobi volume of the selected SMC star clusters would seem underfilled, with a clear trend toward a smaller percentage of underfilled volume as their deprojected distance to the SMC centre increases. Moreover, the internal dynamical evolution of SMC star clusters would seem to be influenced by the SMC gravitational field, being star clusters located closer to the SMC centre in a more advanced evolutionary stage. We compared the internal dynamical evolution of SMC old star clusters with those of LMC and Milky Way globular clusters, and found that Milky Way globular clusters have dynamical evolutionary paths similar to LMC/SMC old star clusters located closer to their respective galaxy's centres. Finally, we speculate with the possibility that globular clusters belonging to Magellanic Clouds like-mass galaxies have lived a couple of times their median relaxation times.",

         "Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. We also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in the generated high-resolution snapshots, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos.",

NICER observations of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 10,000 Hz in a galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10 M_{\\odot}. No extra high-frequency break/bend or any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints on current models of X-ray emission and variability in AGN.",

These working surfaces appear to be \"deflected versions\" of the heads of the incident, HH 270 jet. We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give origin to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow.

         "We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy 'Nube' was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.",

The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.",

         "It is unclear which fraction of cosmic rays above an energy of 1 PeV is accelerated by the observed Galactic PeVatron population. These sources' gamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray population. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458, associated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the diffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of thermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron emission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new constraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population of this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to spectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1, we compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal component. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which coincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that eROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios for the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we find no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence bound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1, which we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From this, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS J1646-458 of 7 uG. This is compatible with a previous estimate in the literature for a fully leptonic source scenario. A purely leptonic emission scenario, a hadronic, and a hybrid one are compatible with our results.",

         "Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.",

         "First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.",

Utilizing N-body and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we assess the dust generation from these impacts, with a focus on the most likely collision parameters derived from the N-body simulations. Our findings indicate that, while collisions among macroscopic bodies are inefficient for dust production, impacts involving Aegaeon are substantially more effective, providing conservative lower limits for dust generation. This mechanism, in conjunction with the natural decay processes and continuous dust generation from impacts, potentially keeps the arc population over thousands of years with a possible variation in brightness.",

         "For minor planet observations to be archived and used by the scientific community, observations of individual objects must be linked together into groups called tracklets. This linking is nontrivial, as linking software must find real tracklets in noisy data within a reasonable amount of time. We describe FindPOTATOs, a linking software written in Python that can assemble minor planet tracklets. With the appropriate parameters, FindPOTATOs assembles tracklets for a variety of objects, including close-approaching near-Earth objects and trans-Neptunian objects. FindPOTATOs is ideal for processing data sets taken at small observatories, processing archival data, or finding tracklets of minor planets on unusual orbits.

         "Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.",

         "Context. Classical chemically peculiar stars exhibit atmospheres that are often structured by the effects of atomic diffusion. As a result of these elemental diffusion and horizontal abundance variations, photospheric temperature varies at a given height in the atmosphere. This may lead to horizontal flows in the photosphere. In addition, the suppression of such flows by magnetic field can alter the elemental transport processes. Aims. Using a simplified model of such a structured atmosphere and 2D MHD simulations of a typical He-rich star, we examine atmospheric flows in these chemically peculiar stars which often are strongly magnetic. Methods. We use Zeus-MP which is a Fortran 90 based publicly available parallel finite element modular code. Results. We find that for non-magnetic stars of spectral type BA, atmospheric flow related to horizontal temperature gradient can reach 1.0 km/s yielding mixing timescale of order of tens of days. For the magnetic counterparts, the flow speeds are an order of magnitude lower allowing for stratification of chemical elements. Conclusions. Magnetic field can influence the dynamics in atmospheres significantly. Strong horizontal magnetic field inhibits flow in the vertical direction, while strong vertical magnetic field can suppress horizontal atmospheric flow preventing elemental mixing.",

         "The current knowledge in cosmology deals with open problems whose solutions are still under investigation. The main issue is the so-called Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, namely, the $4-6 \\sigma$ discrepancy between the local value of $H_0$ obtained with Cepheids+Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the cosmological one estimated from the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For the investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$ ranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$, and CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at intermediate redshift $z>3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern cosmology. The Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are particularly suitable for this task, given their observability up to $z=9.4$. The use of GRBs as standardizable candles requires the use of tight and reliable astrophysical correlations and the presence of gaps in the GRB time-domain data represents an obstacle in this sense. In this work, we propose to improve the precision of the lightcurve (LC) parameters through a reconstruction process performed with the functional forms of GRB LCs and the Gaussian Processes (GP). The filling of gaps in the GRB LCs through these processes shows an improvement up to $41.5\\%$ on the precision of the LC parameters fitting, which lead to a reduced scatter in the astrophysical correlations and, thus, in the estimation of cosmological parameters.",

         "The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.",

         "The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field directly at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of an electric field and better than 6\\% accuracy, with minimal bias, when estimating energy fluence. Additionally, this method is reliable for almost all arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.",

         "Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about the 3/2 ratio with Neptune's. We investigate the long term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, $g$, a well-known characteristic of Pluto's orbit. We show that the $g$ librators amongst the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity--inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincaré at the end of the 19th century. Approximately sixteen percent of the currently known Plutinos exhibit $g$ librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.",

         "We analyse the stellar distributions on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane for 11 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations. Alpha-element bimodality, in the form of two separate sequences on the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane, is not a universal feature of disk galaxies. Five galaxies demonstrate double sequences with the $\\alpha$-enriched one being older and kinematically hotter, in qualitative agreement with the high-$\\alpha$ and low-$\\alpha$ populations in the Milky Way disk; three galaxies have unimodal distribution, two show weakly-bimodal features where low-$\\alpha$ sequence is visible only over a short range of metallicities, and one show strong bimodality with a different slope of high-$\\alpha$ population. We examine the galaxies' gas accretion history over the last 8 Gyr, when bimodal sequences emerge, and demonstrate that the presence of the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in the bimodal galaxies is related to the recent infall of metal-poor gas from the circumgalactic medium that joins the galaxy in the outskirts and induces significant growth of the gas disks compared to their non-bimodal counterparts. We also analyse the sources of the accreted gas and illustrate that both gas-rich mergers and smooth accretion of ambient gas can be the source of the accreted gas, and create slightly different bimodal patterns.",

         "The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.",

         "Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which manifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane which later dissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy I demonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the first one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the pattern speed of the bar so that the distortion remains stationary in the reference frame of the bar. The growth can be described simply with the mechanism of a driven harmonic oscillator which decreases the vertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase most bar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with resonant vertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes of vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal oscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the harmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal frequencies. In the following, second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of the distortion increases reaching one third of the circular frequency, but decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave and winds up leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased horizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of banana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar where the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly suggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose instability but can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical resonance creating the distortion that later winds up.",

         "As the number of potential exomoon candidates grows, there is a heightened motivation of pursing orbital stability analyses. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation into 4-body systems, consisting of a star, planet, moon, and submoon by using the N-body simulator rebound. Particularly, we focus on the system of Kepler-1625, where evidence of a possible exomoon has been obtained. We investigate the 3-body star--planet--moon system for the proposed exomoon parameters allowing us to identify stable regions associated with most of the space parameters. Thereafter, we consider a 4-body system including a potential submoon. We find that there are both stable and unstable regions, as expected, as well as resonance patterns that are further explored using numerical and analytical methods including secular perturbation theory. We are able to identify these resonances as secular in nature. In addition, we investigate 3-body versions of two other systems, Kepler-1708 and HD 23079, while also studying a 4-body version of HD 23079. Our work may serve as a generalized framework for exploring other planet--moon cases in the future while noting that the current 4-body study may be an incentive for studying further exomoon and submoon systems.",

         "Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.",

         "The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $>$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.",

         "The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.",

         "The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude.

         "Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extra-galactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large datasets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of k, g, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the Broad-Line Region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.",

         "We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\\approx 500 {\\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19° E05°). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \\approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \\approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of £ -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19°.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24°. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|° for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10°. 0|--|19°. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17°. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.°2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25°.1 \\pm 0°.5 ILAT and -949 \\pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27°.1 ILAT and -907 \\pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.",

         "Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.",

         "The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.",

         "Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.",

Their variability has been observed to be episodic with large eruptions, along with variations on time-scales of days to decades. We have extracted light curves of 37 LBVs from the first four years of the TESS mission. These light curves provide two years of photometric time-series for stars in the LMC, with several months of data for Galactic or SMC targets. We analyze the Fourier properties of the stellar light curves to determine their characteristic frequencies and red noise amplitudes, comparing them to mass-loss parameters through H$\\alpha$ strength, and in the case of the LMC stars, $B-V$ color and luminosity as estimated by their apparent $g$-magnitudes. We confirm the absence of correlation between any of the Fourier parameters and stellar parameters, implying that there is no trend in how these stars vary as measured with these photometric data, which may point towards these stars being an extension to the supergiant $\\alpha$ Cygni variables and not a unique class of object with regards to their short-term variations.",

         "We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.",

Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfvénic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\\alpha$ Boo gives time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\\dot{M}=3.3\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}/$yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\\gtrsim 10^6$K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with $T\\sim$ a few thousands K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in the mass-loss rate within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvénicthis http URLnonideal MHD simulation for $\\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\\dot{M}=1.5\\times 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}/$yr with the atmospheric temperature $\\lesssim 10^5$K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\\alpha$~Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong.

         "Potential contamination from low/intermediate-redshift galaxies, such as objects with a prominent Balmer break, affects the photometric selection of high-redshift galaxies through identification of a Lyman break. Traditionally, contamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent population of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches applicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and a survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single field, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift $z \\sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \\sim 1.3$. We apply the method to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with simulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases is not measurable and lies below $5.5\\%$ (at $90\\%$ confidence). For random-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count correlation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point correlation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the LBG samples at redshift $z \\sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z \\sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\\%$, consistent with previous estimates in the literature. These results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its utility as an independent check of contamination in photometrically selected samples of high-redshift galaxies.",

The high-ionization N V doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured ($b\\approx14\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) suggest that the absorption gas is photo ionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N III $\\lambda989.80$ is significantly detected while N III* $\\lambda991.51$ (${\\rm log}\\,n_{\\rm c}=3.3\\,\\rm cm^{-3}$) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si IV and H I column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that $T1$, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of $Z\\sim1.5-6.0\\,Z\\rm\\,sun$, and is located at $\\sim15\\,\\rm kpc$ from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy is most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si IV and weak Lyman absorption lines.",

A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.",

         "The circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of Cepheids are still not well characterized despite their potential impact on distance determination via both the period-luminosity relation and the parallax-of-pulsation method. This paper aims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the mid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical nature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight Galactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI in $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence of dust spectral signature for all the star sample. For each star in $L$, $M$ and $N$-band we observe closure phases which are consistent with centro-symmetric geometry for the different targets. Finally, the visibilities in $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular diameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact CSEs within the uncertainties. We provide 2$\\,\\sigma$ upper limits on the CSE flux contribution based on model residuals for several CSE radius, which yield to exclude models simultaneously large and bright ($R_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\,R_\\star$ and $f_\\mathrm{CSE}\\approx10\\%$) for all the stars of the sample. Last, the visibilities in the $N$-band rule out CSE models with significant amount of different type of dust. The MATISSE observations of eight Cepheids with different pulsation period (from 7 up to 38$\\,$day) and evolution stage, provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of Cepheids from mid-IR interferometry. We present additional evidences that circumstellar dust emission is negligible or absent around Cepheids for a wide range of stellar parameters in the instability strip. Further interferometric observations in the visible and the near-infrared will be necessary to disentangle the star and the CSE.",

         "In this work, we update the unsupervised machine learning (UML) step by proposing an algorithm based on ConvNeXt large model coding to improve the efficiency of unlabeled galaxy morphology classifications. The method can be summarized into three key aspects as follows: (1) a convolutional autoencoder is used for image denoising and reconstruction and the rotational invariance of the model is improved by polar coordinate extension; (2) utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) named ConvNeXt for encoding the image data. The features were further compressed via a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction; (3) adopting a bagging-based multi-model voting classification algorithm to enhance robustness. We applied this model to I-band images of a galaxy sample with $I_{\\rm mag}< 25$ in the COSMOS field. Compared to the original unsupervised method, the number of clustering groups required by the new method is reduced from 100 to 20. Finally, we managed to classify about 53\\% galaxies, significantly improving the classification efficiency. To verify the validity of the morphological classification, we selected massive galaxies with $M(*)>10^{10}(M(sun))$ for morphological parameter tests. The corresponding rules between the classification results and the physical properties of galaxies on multiple parameter surfaces are consistent with the existing evolution model. Our method has demonstrated the feasibility of using large model encoding to classify galaxy morphology, which not only improves the efficiency of galaxy morphology classification, but also saves time and manpower. Furthermore, in comparison to the original UML model, the enhanced classification performance is more evident in qualitative analysis and has successfully surpassed a greater number of parameter tests.",

         "Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\\gtrsim 30\\degree$, at $b\\lesssim 30 \\degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.",

         "We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.",

         "Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $<0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.",

         "3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.",

Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \\pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.",

         "The solar atmosphere displays a sharp temperature gradient, starting from spicules in the chromosphere at $2 \\times 10^4$ K, outward into the corona exceeding $10^6$ K. Plasma turbulence produced by the transverse motion of magnetic fields anchored in the photosphere is likely the energy source producing this gradient. However, very little is known about the turbulent structures near the solar surface. Using the highest spatial resolution white-light total solar eclipse image to date, we measure the transverse correlation length at distances ranging from 0.33 to 9 Mm above the solar surface-two orders of magnitude closer than previous estimates. Our results show that the turbulence injection scale in the chromosphere is ~1.5 Mm, which we associate with the size of granules since they are the only structured features of comparable size. Further, the change in perpendicular correlation length with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4 Mm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower thereafter. We associate this radial gradient with the expansion of the magnetic field in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.",

         "Role of gravitational decoupling on theoretical insights of relativistic massive compact stars in the mass gap",
         "Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \\, M_{\\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \\, M_\\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \\, M_\\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\\odot$ for $\\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.",

         "This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.",

         "Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.",

The grid is calculated using the atomic model of sulfur incorporating the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and hydrogen. The inclusion of levels and transitions of ionized sulfur in the atomic model made it possible to expand the range of effective temperatures of stellar photospheres in the grid up to 10000 K. The atomic model was tested in determining the sulfur abundance of 13 stars and showed its adequacy in a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters. In the spectra of all test stars, the sulfur lines are fitted with similar abundances of the element, regardless of the degree of influence of the effects of deviation from LTE on a particular spectral line. For lines of several multiplets, the wavelengths and oscillator strengths were refined. A list of S I lines recommended for determining sulfur abundance has been created.",

         "We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (< 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (< 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\\circ$ to 82$^\\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\\Theta$ (~ 180$^\\circ$ to 240$^\\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.",

         "This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The mass fractions of these nuclei were calculated using the Sahas equation which assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium for a set of initial conditions ($T_9$, $\\rho$ and $Y_e$) that represents the trajectory which a massive stars central region takes after its silicon core burns. Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK. In comparison with large scale shell model, our computed rates were found bigger at high values of core temperature.

         "The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppostthis http URLmost recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups. Larger black hole mass and considerably lower Eddington ratio would allow to see larger differences between a single lamppost and a two-lampost model. UV/optical reverberation mapping is not very sensitive to the vertical extension of the corona.",

         "A significant part of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies orbit within a Vast POlar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, whose origin has not yet been identified. It includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its six dynamically associated dwarf galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy (M31) experienced a major merger two to three billion years ago, and its accurate modelling predicts that an associated tidal tail is pointing toward the Galaxy. Here, we have tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles and MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs since they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy orbits by one billion years and calculated their association to the tidal tail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from Gaia DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass smaller than 5 $\\times 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than 1$\\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, while an important degree of freedom is provided by the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that many other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their motions had been radially slowed down, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by the MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the VPOS, which came from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.",

         "In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $> 80\\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.",

         "Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\\sigma\\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E>B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection'' stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\\zeta(\\epsilon^\\ast,\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$) by $E>B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\\epsilon^\\ast=\\sigma/4$; here, $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}$; for $\\sigma\\gtrsim 50$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm T}/\\sigma\\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\\gtrsim 80\\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\\epsilon^\\ast=\\sigma/4$ occurs in $E>B$ regions.

         "The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the $z\\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred $z\\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of $M_\\mathrm{UV}\\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and $z\\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\\sim16-22.5$ and find none. We also estimate the $z\\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the $z\\geq14$ subset of the $z\\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at $z\\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high number densities at $-18\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim-17$, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of $-2.5\\lesssim\\alpha\\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population of faint ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.",

         "Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy formation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the mass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the challenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the PAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This approach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red galaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\\odot}$. However, it is not straightforward to completely separate the twothis http URLaddress this issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central (isolated) galaxies, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining the 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r; M_{*,\\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\mathrm{p}}(r_{\\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar mass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed total quenched fraction, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection, we assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling a comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched fraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5}, 10^{11.0}]M_{\\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from 0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire stellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more effective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass has minimal influence on environmental quenching.",

Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 < z < 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets.

         "We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting pulsed CH maser emission in the interstellar medium stimulated by pulsar photons.",

         "The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now. However, more precise and repetitive measurements, which might be available in near future, are needed for definite conclusions.",

         "We report the analysis of the detached eclipsing spectroscopic binary system LAMOST J101356.33+272410.7, which features a massive white dwarf. Using LAMOST and SDSS spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and radial velocities of both components. SED fitting of photometric data from GALEX, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1 yielded the effective temperatures and photometric radii. Eclipsing analysis of high-speed photometric data from the Liverpool Telescope provided orbital inclination, masses, radii, and related physical parameters. The white dwarf in this system has a mass of $1.05 \\pm 0.09 \\, M_\\odot$ and a radius of $0.0090 \\pm 0.0008 \\, R_\\odot$, while the main-sequence star has a mass of $0.299 \\pm 0.045 \\, M_\\odot$ and a radius of $0.286 \\pm 0.018 \\, R_\\odot$. Emission lines observed in the spectra indicate the likely presence of stellar magnetic activity in this system. The relatively cool temperature of the white dwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB) that has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white dwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic variable (dCV) crossing the period gap. We suggest that the system is more likely to be a PCEB, and it is predicted to evolve into a cataclysmic variable and begin mass transfer in approximately 0.27 Gyr.",

         "We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z<1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.",

         "We present the HI surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$) radial distributions based on total-power HI images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72 degree. We derive the HI radius $R_{001}$, which is the radius for the 0.01 $\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ ($\\sim10^{18.1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) iso-density level, 100 times deeper than the 1 $\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ level previously commonly used to measure $R_1$. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and $R_1$, but align more tightly with radius normalized by $R_{001}$. The universal HI profile has a scatter of $\\sim0.2$ dex, and a scale-length of $\\sim0.11R_{001}$ in the outer region. We derive a new $R_{001}$-$M_{\\rm HI}$ relation, which has a scatter of 0.02 dex, and similar slope of $\\sim$0.5 as the previously known $R_1$-$M_{\\rm HI}$ relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio $R_{001}/R_1$ (anti-)correlate strongly and significantly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio and sSFR, but not with the stellar mass, $M_{\\rm HI}$, dark matter mass, or SFR. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends, and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that in absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that $\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$ distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01$\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way, that HI-richer galaxies have HI disks not only extend further, but also transport HI inward more efficiently from $R_{001}$ to $R_1$.",

         "Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\\approx$10\\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.",

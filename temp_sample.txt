\begin{abstract}
Variability studies offer a compelling glimpse into black hole dynamics, and NICER's (Neutron Star 
Interior Composition Explorer)
remarkable temporal resolution propels us even further.
NICER observations of an Active Galactic 
Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive 
black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning 
a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power 
Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 
10$^4$~Hz in a 
galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10~$M_{\odot}$. No extra high-frequency break/bend or 
any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that 
 the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent 
across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant 
temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints

\abstract{Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out o
